Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or lymph node cells (LNC) depleted of B cells and monocytes were intraperitoneally injected into SCID mice treated with antimurine interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2+) beta chain monoclonal antibody (MoAb)(TM-beta 1), followed by daily injection of human recombinant IL-2 until 60 days after cell injection. SCID mice injected with ATL cells from 6 of 8 ATL patients were found to have the tumor or leukemia 5 to 7 weeks after the inoculation of cells. Serum levels of soluble form of human IL-2R alpha chain (Tac) were markedly elevated in such mice. The cells recovered from the mice injected with leukemic cells from four different ATL patients had the same cell surface phenotype as that of original leukemic cells which were CD4+Tac+. Furthermore, we detected the same integration site of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) provirus and the same rearrangement pattern of human T-cell receptor (TCR) beta chain gene as those of ATL cells by Southern blot hybridization, indicating that the cells proliferating in SCID mice were derived from the original ATL cell clone. Histologic examination showed that the pattern of the infiltration of ATL cells into various organs in SCID mice was similar to that of an ATL patient. Such a model of in vivo cell proliferation of ATL cells will be useful for the study of the mechanism of neoplastic cell proliferation and for the development of a new and effective treatment of ATL.","['Kondo, A', 'Imada, K', 'Hattori, T', 'Yamabe, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'Miyasaka, M', 'Okuma, M', 'Uchiyama, T']","['Kondo A', 'Imada K', 'Hattori T', 'Yamabe H', 'Tanaka T', 'Miyasaka M', 'Okuma M', 'Uchiyama T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine and Laboratory of Anatomic Pathology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/microbiology/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84045-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2501-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report that, in mice infected with a recombinant spleen focus-forming retrovirus (SFFV) expressing an oncogenic erythropoietin receptor (EpoR), there was an increase in platelet count preceding the ensuing erythrocytosis. Concurrently, there was a substantial increase in splenic megakaryocytes. Culture of the bone marrow and spleen cells from infected mice showed enhanced numbers of multipotent megakaryocytic progenitors. DNA polymerase chain reaction analysis of individual megakaryocyte-containing colonies showed recombinant SFFV (SFFVcEpoR) proviral integration. Immunofluorescence of spleen sections showed overexpression of EpoR protein in the megakaryocytes. Mice infected with a strain of SFFV also developed splenic megakaryocytosis without activating overexpression of the EpoR in megakaryocytes. This in vivo system shows that a relationship between erythropoiesis and thrombopoiesis can exist at the level of the Epo-EpoR signaling pathway. Also, SFFV-based vectors may be excellent vehicles for the introduction of genes into multipotent, hematopoietic progenitors, in vitro.","['Longmore, G D', 'Pharr, P', 'Neumann, D', 'Lodish, H F']","['Longmore GD', 'Pharr P', 'Neumann D', 'Lodish HF']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/physiopathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/analysis/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*physiopathology', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Tumor Virus Infections/physiopathology']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84032-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2386-95.,"['HL32262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NIA AG00294/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",['Blood. 1994 Jun 15;83(12):3829-31.

Interferons (IFNs) represent another group of cytokines that are induced by similar stimuli in inflammatory reactions. We show now that type-I IFNs are potent inhibitors of IL-8 expression in vitro and in vivo. A significant reduction of both secretion of IL-8 protein and accumulation of IL-8 mRNA in vitro was observed in several cell types comprising peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) from healthy donors and from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the myelomonocytic cell line THP-1, and bone marrow (BM) stromal cells as a representative model for BM microenvironment. By contrast, in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated polymorphonuclear phagocytes IFN failed to suppress IL-8 expression. In untreated patients with CML, a constitutive expression of IL-8 mRNA was detected in freshly isolated PBMNC that was markedly reduced 5 hours after therapeutic application of IFN-alpha. The mechanism of IL-8 downregulation was studied more in detail in the THP-1 cell line. The experiments showed that de novo protein synthesis was not required for the inhibitory effect. RNA decay analysis and nuclear run-on assays suggest that in THP-1 cell line the inhibition of IL-8 expression is predominantly regulated at the posttranscriptional level.","['Aman, M J', 'Rudolf, G', 'Goldschmitt, J', 'Aulitzky, W E', 'Lam, C', 'Huber, C', 'Peschel, C']","['Aman MJ', 'Rudolf G', 'Goldschmitt J', 'Aulitzky WE', 'Lam C', 'Huber C', 'Peschel C']","['Department of Medicine, Johannes-Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-8/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84030-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2371-8.,,,,,,,,,,

When cultured with EPO, they survive and complete terminal differentiation. Although cell volume is decreased and nuclear chromatin is condensed during both apoptosis and terminal differentiation, morphologic and biochemical distinctions between these two processes were observed. In apoptosis, homogeneous nuclear condensation with nuclear envelope loss occurred in cells that had not reached the stage of hemoglobin synthesis. In terminal erythroid differentiation, nuclear condensation with heterochromatin, euchromatin, and nuclear envelope preservation occurred simultaneously with hemoglobin synthesis. Cells with apoptotic morphology appeared asynchronously in EPO-deprived cultures, indicating that only a portion of the cells were undergoing apoptosis at any given time. The percentages of apoptotic cells and cleaved DNA increased with time in EPO-deprived cultures. Inhibition of DNA cleavage was directly proportional to EPO concentration over a wide physiologic range, demonstrating a heterogeneity in susceptibility to apoptosis based on variability in the EPO sensitivity of individual cells. A subpopulation of FVA cells with increased EPO sensitivity (decreased EPO requirement) was isolated from EPO-deprived cultures. This increased EPO sensitivity did not result from differences in EPO receptor number, affinity, or structure, suggesting that the differences are in the signal transduction pathway. These results indicate that control of red blood cell production involves both prevention of apoptosis by EPO and heterogeneity in the EPO requirement of individual progenitor cells.","['Kelley, L L', 'Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C', 'Koury, S T', 'Sawyer, S T', 'Wickrema, A']","['Kelley LL', 'Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC', 'Koury ST', 'Sawyer ST', 'Wickrema A']","['Division of Hematology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232-2287.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Erythroblasts/*drug effects/physiology', 'Erythrocyte Aging/drug effects', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/physiology']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84027-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2340-52.,"['DK31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK39781/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DKF32-05884/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

All patients had previously received marrow grafts from HLA-identical siblings. Six patients were in the accelerated phase of their disease and two were in blast crisis. Each patient received a predetermined T-cell dose within a narrow range of 2.5 to 5.0 x 10(8) T cells/kg. Three patients also received short courses of therapy with alpha interferon to control elevated white blood cell counts within the first several weeks after leukocyte transfusions. Seven of eight evaluable patients developed graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) at a median of 32 days after the initial infusion. One patient had fatal GVHD. A second patient had grade 3 acute GVHD, which has responded to immunosuppressive therapy. The remaining patients all had mild grade I GVHD. Six patients continue to require modest doses of prednisone more than 6 months after infusion. Four patients developed marrow aplasia, which in three patients required marrow boosts from the original donors. Two of these three patients have normal hematopoietic function, whereas the third patient remains growth factor and transfusion dependent. Both patients treated in blast crisis have died, one from GVHD and one from disease progression. All six patients in the accelerated phase are alive and in cytogenetic remission at a median of 42 weeks after infusion. Five of these six patients are in molecular remission. This study demonstrates that leukocyte infusions that administered a defined T-cell dose can exert a profound graft-versus-leukemia effect and are an effective form of salvage immunotherapy in allogeneic marrow transplant recipients. This therapeutic approach appears to be a viable alternative to existing chemotherapeutic and immunomodulatory strategies for the treatment of relapsed CML.","['Drobyski, W R', 'Keever, C A', 'Roth, M S', 'Koethe, S', 'Hanson, G', 'McFadden, P', 'Gottschall, J L', 'Ash, R C', 'van Tuinen, P', 'Horowitz, M M']","['Drobyski WR', 'Keever CA', 'Roth MS', 'Koethe S', 'Hanson G', 'McFadden P', 'Gottschall JL', 'Ash RC', 'van Tuinen P', 'Horowitz MM', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Chimera', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', '*Salvage Therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84023-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2310-8.,"['5 R29DK43470/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 01534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We report now on the long-term outcome for these patients treated on a single protocol with 3 different treatment arms, all of which included glucocorticoid pulses during maintenance therapy. GR were quantitated in leukemic cells from 546 children with ALL at the time of diagnosis. Immunophenotyping studies were performed on all specimens. Prior studies showed that in pre-B- and early pre-B-cell ALL, successful remission induction was associated with a median GR number of 9,900 sites/cell, whereas induction failure was associated with a median receptor number of 4,800 sites/cell. Long-term follow-up of these patients shows an association between higher GR number and improved prognosis. The 5-year event-free survival of 61.0% (SE 2.8%) for patients whose leukemic cells had greater than 8,000 receptors/cell and 47.3% (SE 3.3%) for those with less than 8,000 receptors/cell is significantly different (P < .001). This difference remains significant when adjusted multivariately for blast immunophenotype and clinical risk factors (P < .001) or for treatment type (P < .001). We conclude that GR number greater than 8,000 sites/leukemic cell is a favorable prognostic marker for children with acute lymphocytic leukemia. This finding offers deeper insights into molecular mechanisms of anti-leukemia therapy and suggests that manipulation of steroid receptor number might augment the antitumor response, thus opening new avenues for basic and clinical research.","['Kato, G J', 'Quddus, F F', 'Shuster, J J', 'Boyett, J', 'Pullen, J D', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Whitehead, V M', 'Crist, W M', 'Leventhal, B G']","['Kato GJ', 'Quddus FF', 'Shuster JJ', 'Boyett J', 'Pullen JD', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Whitehead VM', 'Crist WM', 'Leventhal BG']","['Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'C137DTR5RG (Theophylline)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Theophylline/pharmacology']",1993/10/15 00:00,1993/10/15 00:01,['1993/10/15 00:00'],"['1993/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84022-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 15;82(8):2304-9.,"['CA-28476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

However, relapses occur when ATRA is prescribed as maintenance therapy, and resistance to a second ATRA-induction therapy is frequently observed. An induced hypercatabolism of ATRA has been suggested as a possible mechanism leading to reduced ATRA sensitivity and resistance. CRABPII, an RA cytoplasmic binding protein linked to RA's metabolization pathway, is induced by ATRA in different cell systems. To investigate whether specific features of the AML3 cells at relapse could explain the in vivo resistance observed, we studied the CRABP levels and in vitro sensitivity to ATRA of AML3 cells before and at relapse from ATRA. Relapse-AML3 cells (n = 12) showed reduced differentiation induction when compared with ""virgin""-AML3 cells (n = 31; P < .05). Dose-response studies were performed in 2 cases at relapse and showed decreased sensitivity to low ATRA concentrations. CRABPII levels and in vitro differentiation characteristics of AML3 cells before and at relapse from ATRA therapy were studied concomittantly in 4 patients. High levels of CRABPII (median, 20 fmol/mg of protein) were detected in the cells of the 4 patients at relapse but were not detected before ATRA therapy. Three of these patients showed a decrease in differentiation induction of their leukemic cells, and a failure to achieve CR with a second induction therapy of ATRA 45 mg/m2/day was noted in all patients treated (n = 3). Results from this study provide evidence to support the hypothesis of induced-ATRA metabolism as one of the major mechanisms responsible for ATRA resistance. Monitoring CRABPII levels after ATRA withdrawal may help to determine when to administer ATRA in the maintenance or relapse therapy of AML3 patients.","['Delva, L', 'Cornic, M', 'Balitrand, N', 'Guidez, F', 'Miclea, J M', 'Delmer, A', 'Teillet, F', 'Fenaux, P', 'Castaigne, S', 'Degos, L']","['Delva L', 'Cornic M', 'Balitrand N', 'Guidez F', 'Miclea JM', 'Delmer A', 'Teillet F', 'Fenaux P', 'Castaigne S', 'Degos L', 'et al.']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Universite Paris VII, Centre Hayem, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82330-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2175-81.,,['Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):1949-53.

Owing to the increasing number of available monoclonal antihuman TCR reagents, it could be of interest to evaluate the feasibility of anti-TCR treatment during T-cell CLL. To test the therapeutic potentiality of anti-TCR monoclonal antibodies, we first analyzed the intraclonal variability in two terminally ill patients suffering from TCR alpha beta-positive cell CLL bearing different immunophenotypes. The cDNA corresponding to the variable regions of the TCR beta chains originating from the malignant T cells were amplified, cloned into M13 phages, and sequenced. The sequence analysis of multiple independent clones showed no intraclonal variability, with no evidence for ongoing hypermutation in the V beta region genes. The relevance of these findings with regard to an anti-V beta therapy and the comparison with similar analysis during B-cell monoclonal lymphoproliferations are discussed.","['Picard, F', 'Martin, T', 'Legras, F', 'Lioure, B', 'Pasquali, J L']","['Picard F', 'Martin T', 'Legras F', 'Lioure B', 'Pasquali JL']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunopathologie, Hopital Central, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, France.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'CD4 Antigens/blood', 'CD8 Antigens/blood', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/blood/genetics/*immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/blood', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82326-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2152-6.,,,,['GENBANK/UNKNOWN'],,,,,,

This state was defined by the presence of molecularly-detectable monoclonal proliferation of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T lymphocytes, and the absence of clinical symptoms of leukemia. The median observation time was 50 months. The pre-ATL subjects were divided into two groups according to initial white blood cell (WBC) counts: group A, those with a normal WBC count (9,000/microL) (n = 30), and group B, those with an increased WBC count (9,000 to 15,000) (n = 20). Comparisons were made between the two groups and with a group of 25 patients with chronic ATL (group C) who had WBC counts of more than 15,000. Significant differences in survival rate were found between groups A and B (10-year survival 65.7%) and group C (32.8%) (P < .01), and between group A (10-year survival 90.0%) and group B (52.1%) (P < .05). The incidence of transformation to overt ATL was 10% (3 of 30) in group A and 50% (10 of 20) in group B (P < .01). In six transformed cases (one in A and five in B) we found exactly the same integration sites in pre-ATL and overt ATL phases, confirming the multistep leukemogenesis hypothesized for this disease. However, the pre-ATL subjects could be divided into two distinct prognostic groups based on the initial WBC count; those with good and those with poor prognosis. Although the 10% transformation rate (2.5% annually) in group A seemed to be extremely high compared with that in the general population of HTLV-I carriers (around 0.06% to 0.4% annually), the majority of group A subjects and some in group B showed stable clinical courses without transformation. Further, development of ATL was not observed in four group A subjects with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM), which is rarely associated with ATL. We propose to call this group of rather benign HTLV-I carriers ""HTLV-I carriers with monoclonal proliferation of T lymphocytes (HCMPT)."" Thus far we have been unable to identify reliable parameters other than WBC counts that prospectively distinguish HCMPT from the true pre-ATL state, in which there is a high probability of developing ATL. Further clinical and biologic approaches should elucidate the natural history of the HTLV-I carrier state and early events in ATL leukemogenesis.","['Ikeda, S', 'Momita, S', 'Kinoshita, K', 'Kamihira, S', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Ito, M', 'Kanda, T', 'Moriuchi, R', 'Nakamura, T']","['Ikeda S', 'Momita S', 'Kinoshita K', 'Kamihira S', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Ito M', 'Kanda T', 'Moriuchi R', 'Nakamura T', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carrier State/epidemiology/immunology/*physiopathology', 'Cause of Death', 'DNA, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/epidemiology/immunology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Leukocyte Count', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/epidemiology/immunology/mortality/*physiopathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Integration']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82309-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Oct 1;82(7):2017-24.,,,,,,,,,,

The assay gave reproducible results and allowed differences in BCR-ABL message levels of half an order of magnitude to be distinguished. Of 91 patients studied by nonquantitative PCR, 28 who had a positive PCR result on at least one occasion posttransplant were analyzed by competitive PCR. Seventeen patients had no evidence in their marrow of cytogenetic relapse during the period of observation; BCR-ABL transcript numbers in these cases ranged from approximately 10 to 800/micrograms RNA. Ten of the 11 patients who relapsed cytogenetically were studied when Philadelphia-positive metaphases were first detected in their marrow; transcript numbers ranged from 1,600 to 7 x 10(5)/micrograms RNA. Patients in hematologic relapse had between 9 x 10(4) and 10(6) BCR-ABL transcripts/micrograms RNA. Patients who progressed from cytogenetic remission to cytogenetic relapse and then to hematologic relapse had increasing numbers of BCR-ABL transcripts in their blood. Three patients had clear evidence of rising numbers of BCR-ABL transcripts before routine detection of cytogenetic relapse. Conversely patients without cytogenetic relapse generally had low or falling numbers of transcripts.

Five patients showed a stable mixed chimerism pattern characterized by the presence of both recipient as well as donor type cells in all cell populations up to 1 year posttransplantation. Five others showed transient mixed chimerism in the T-lymphoid cell lineage. In one patient, host T cells persisted until leukemia relapse. The remaining 21 patients showed a complete chimerism throughout the period of investigation. Twenty-five of these patients were classified according to the presence (n = 10) or absence (n = 15) of recipient type T cells. Statistical analysis did not show significant differences in the distribution of a number of clinical variables between the two groups, nor in the actuarial survival (P = .11) and leukemia-free interval (P = .97). Therefore, these results suggest that persistence of recipient type T lymphoid cells after allogeneic BMT for hematologic malignancies is not correlated with leukemia relapse. In addition, we observed that persistence of host cells within the original leukemia cell lineage and at the correct maturational stage was predictive for leukemia relapse in one case.","['van Leeuwen, J E', 'van Tol, M J', 'Joosten, A M', 'Wijnen, J T', 'Khan, P M', 'Vossen, J M']","['van Leeuwen JE', 'van Tol MJ', 'Joosten AM', 'Wijnen JT', 'Khan PM', 'Vossen JM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chimera', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78370-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1921-8.,,,,,,,,,,

We linked hypersensitivity site 2 (HS2) from the locus control region (LCR) to a A gamma-globin gene (A gamma*) mutationally marked to allow its transcript to be distinguished from endogenous gamma-globin mRNA. The vector also contains the phosphotransferase gene that confers resistance to neomycin (NeoR). HS2 region mutations within the NF-E2 motifs prevented NF-E2 binding while preserving AP-1 binding. Another set in the GATA-1 motif prevented binding of the factor. Several NeoR K562 clones containing a single unrearranged RAAV genome with the A gamma* gene linked to the native HS2 core fragment (WT), mutant NF-E2 HS2 (mut-NFE2), mutant GATA-1 HS2 (mut-GATA1), or no HS [(-)HS] were identified. In uninduced K562 cells, mut-NFE2 clones expressed A gamma* mRNA at the same level as the WT clones, compared with a lack of A gamma* signal in the (-)HS2 clones. However, hemin induction of mut-NFE2 clones did not result in an increase in the A gamma* signal above the level seen in uninduced cells. Mut-GATA1 clones expressed the A gamma* mRNA at the same level as WT clones in both uninduced and induced cells. Thus, GATA-1 binding to this site does not appear to be required for the enhancing function of HS2 in this context. This single-copy rAAV transduction model is useful for evaluating the effects of specific mutations in regulatory elements on the transcription of linked genes.","['Miller, J L', 'Walsh, C E', 'Ney, P A', 'Samulski, R J', 'Nienhuis, A W']","['Miller JL', 'Walsh CE', 'Ney PA', 'Samulski RJ', 'Nienhuis AW']","['Clinical Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Dependovirus/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/*biosynthesis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics/*physiology']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78367-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1900-6.,['HL 48347-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Blood 1995 Feb 1;85(3):862'],,,

During eosinophilic differentiation of eosinophil-committed cell lines, CLC steady state mRNA levels increase significantly. This increased expression is transcriptionally regulated during butyrate induction of an eosinophilic subline (C15) of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60, as shown by nuclear run-on assays. The transcriptional start site of the CLC gene was identified 43 bp upstream of the 5' end of the longest available cDNA sequence. The gene encoding CLC protein was cloned from a chromosome 19-specific library and a fragment overlapping the transcriptional start site was isolated and sequenced. Plasmid constructs (in the pXP2 luciferase expression vector) containing 411 and 292 bp of genomic sequence upstream of the CLC transcriptional start site directed reporter gene expression in transient transfections of HL-60-C15 cells, as well as other myeloid (U937) and nonmyeloid (HeLa and RPMI 8402) cell lines. However, the differential expression of the two CLC promoter constructs in these cell lines suggests that the -292 to -411 bp region of the promoter may confer some specificity for expression in the eosinophil lineage. The CLC promoter sequence contains two consensus GATA binding sites, a purine-rich sequence that presents potential binding sites for PU.1, a member of the ets family of genes, as well as sequences described in other myeloid-specific promoters. This is the first demonstration of a functional eosinophil promoter that could serve as a model for identifying DNA elements and trans-activating factors that regulate gene expression during the commitment and differentiation of the eosinophil lineage.","['Gomolin, H I', 'Yamaguchi, Y', 'Paulpillai, A V', 'Dvorak, L A', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Tenen, D G']","['Gomolin HI', 'Yamaguchi Y', 'Paulpillai AV', 'Dvorak LA', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Tenen DG']","['Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA 02215.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (Lysophospholipase)', 'EC 3.1.1.5 (lysolecithin acylhydrolase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Eosinophils/*enzymology', 'Genomic Library', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Lysophospholipase/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/blood/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78363-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1868-74.,"['AI25230/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33043/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/L01664', 'GENBANK/L01665']",,,,,,

Yet, paradoxically, APL cells are exquisitely sensitive to retinoic acid (RA), as they terminally differentiate upon RA exposure. In this report, we have examined the expression of PML and PML/RAR alpha in normal and APL cells. By immunofluorescence or immunocytochemistry, we show that PML has a speckled nuclear pattern of expression that contrasts with that of PML/RAR alpha (mostly a micropunctuated nuclear pattern or a cytoplasmic localization). The APL-derived cell line NB4 that expresses both the PML and PML/RAR alpha genes also shows the fine micropunctuated nuclear pattern, suggesting a dominant effect of the fusion protein over the localization of wild-type PML. RA treatment of NB4 cells or clones expressing PML/RAR alpha gradually leads to a PML pattern before apparent morphologic maturation. In 14 untreated APL patients, the PML-reactive proteins were cytoplasmic (by immunocytochemistry) or both cytoplasmic and nuclear with a micropunctuated pattern (by immunofluorescence). Strikingly, in 4 patients, after 1 to 2 weeks of RA therapy, the speckled nuclear PML pattern reappeared concomitant with the onset of differentiation. These results establish that fusion of PML to RAR alpha results in an altered localization of PML that is reverted upon RA treatment. This observation, which highlights the importance of PML, is likely to be a key to unravelling the molecular mechanism of both leukemogenesis and RA-induced differentiation of APL.","['Daniel, M T', 'Koken, M', 'Romagne, O', 'Barbey, S', 'Bazarbachi, A', 'Stadler, M', 'Guillemin, M C', 'Degos, L', 'Chomienne, C', 'de The, H']","['Daniel MT', 'Koken M', 'Romagne O', 'Barbey S', 'Bazarbachi A', 'Stadler M', 'Guillemin MC', 'Degos L', 'Chomienne C', 'de The H']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CNRS 43, Centre Hayem, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glutathione Transferase/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78362-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1858-67.,,,['PML'],,,,,,,

Cases studied included 39 chronic lymphocytic leukemias, 58 low-grade follicular lymphomas, 20 mantle cell lymphomas, 30 small noncleaved cell lymphomas, 25 acute lymphoblastic leukemias, 10 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and 44 diffuse mixed- or diffuse large-cell lymphomas. In addition, 38 aggressive lymphomas (transformed follicular lymphomas) derived from previously indolent follicular lymphomas were examined. Southern blot analysis showed BCL-3 locus rearrangement in 4 cases (1.5%), ie, in 3 transformed follicular lymphomas and in 1 indolent follicular lymphoma. All 4 also had BCL-2 rearrangements consistent with their follicular center cell origin. None of the BCL-3 rearranged cases showed MYC gene rearrangement, as reported for the original leukemia that led to the discovery of BCL-3. Pretransformation specimens of all three transformed follicular lymphomas showed the presence of the BCL-3 alteration before histologic progression. In 1 case, serial pretransformation biopsies showed that the BCL-3 rearrangement was acquired during the indolent follicular phase of the patient's disease. Thirty lymphomas, including 2 of the 4 with BCL-3 rearrangement, were also examined for BCL-3 message. All 30, including the 2 with BCL-3 rearrangements, expressed the normal 1.7-kb BCL-3 transcript, at approximately equivalent levels. The data indicate that, although BCL-3 locus alterations are found in only a small fraction of B-cell lymphoid malignancies, they occur primarily in a subset of follicular center cell lymphomas. Interestingly, these alterations appear to be acquired during the indolent (follicular) phase of the disease and they are maintained when histologic transformation takes place. The data also suggest that BCL-3 locus alterations do not result in gross changes of BCL-3 gene expression and do not necessarily involve the MYC gene. Although the preferential involvement of BCL-3 alterations in a small subset of follicular lymphomas that transform suggests a possible link between these abnormalities and progression, further studies are needed to ensure that these alterations are biologically relevant and not simply a manifestation of genomic instability.","['Yano, T', 'Sander, C A', 'Andrade, R E', 'Gauwerky, C E', 'Croce, C M', 'Longo, D L', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Raffeld, M']","['Yano T', 'Sander CA', 'Andrade RE', 'Gauwerky CE', 'Croce CM', 'Longo DL', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['Hematopathology Section, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein)', '0 (BCL3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Cell Lymphoma 3 Protein', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78357-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1813-9.,,,"['BCL-1', 'BCL-2', 'BCL-3', 'MYC', 'PRAD1']",,,,,,,

This suggested that platelets, rather than leukocytes, may be associated with the pathogenesis of the acquired vWF abnormality seen in these patients. To examine the hypothesis further, we studied 12 patients with reactive thrombocytosis after splenectomy. Increased platelet count (> 5 x 10(11)/L) after splenectomy was associated with vWF abnormalities indistinguishable from those detected in patients with myeloproliferative disorders. Accordingly, there was an inverse correlation between proportion of large vWF multimers and platelet, but not leukocyte, number: normalization of the platelet count was accompanied by restoration of a normal vWF multimeric pattern. These findings suggest that an increase in the number of platelets circulating in blood may favor the adsorption of larger vWF multimers onto the platelet membrane, resulting in their removal from the circulation and subsequent degradation.","['Budde, U', 'Scharf, R E', 'Franke, P', 'Hartmann-Budde, K', 'Dent, J', 'Ruggeri, Z M']","['Budde U', 'Scharf RE', 'Franke P', 'Hartmann-Budde K', 'Dent J', 'Ruggeri ZM']","['Blood Transfusion Service, AK Harburg, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Weight', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood', 'Osteomyelitis/blood', '*Platelet Count', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood', 'von Willebrand Factor/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78350-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1749-57.,['HL-48728/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In general the patients did not suffer untoward reactions, and in 18 of 19 cases did not have a reduction in normal formed elements of the blood. Seven patients developed remissions that were mixed (1 patient), partial (4 patients), or complete (2 patients), with partial and complete remissions lasting from 9 weeks to more than 3 years as assessed by routine hematologic tests, immunofluorescence analysis, and molecular genetic analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearrangements and of HTLV-I proviral integration. Furthermore, remission was associated with a return to normal serum calcium levels and an improvement of liver function tests. Remission was also associated in some cases with an amelioration of the profound immunodeficiency state that characterizes ATL.

Of the 264 patients. 125 patients (47%) had Rai stage III-IV disease; 169 patients (64%) were previously treated with a median of 3 prior regimens; and 138 of them (82%) were refractory to therapy with alkylating agents. The overall response (OR) and complete response (CR) rates in the 169 previously-treated patients were 52% and 37%; these were 74% and 63%, respectively, in Rai stage O-II patients and declined to 64% and 46%, respectively, in Rai III-IV disease. Among the previously untreated patients, the OR and CR rates were 79% and 63%, these being 85% and 70%, respectively, in Rai O-II patients, and declining to 64% and 46%, respectively, in Rai III-IV disease. The incidence of minor infections or fever of unknown origin was similar in all patient groups and occurred in 22% of courses. The incidence of sepsis and/or pneumonia was significantly correlated with the extent of prior therapy and with Rai stage, and ranged from 3% of courses in the previously untreated Rai O-II patients, to 13% of courses in the previously treated Rai III-IV patients. Listeria sepsis or Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was noted in 14 patients. With therapy, CD4 levels were uniformly depressed from a median 1,015/microL pretreatment to a median 159/microL after 3 months of fludarabine therapy. Median time to progression in previously treated patients was 22 months. In previously untreated patients, median time to progression was 30 months for patients who achieved a partial remission and has not been reached in patients who achieved a CR with a median follow-up of 2 years. The median survival was 18 months for previously treated patients and has not been reached for previously untreated patients. Response rates in previously treated and untreated patients, as well as infection rates, were identical to those seen in 110 patients treated with the same dose schedule of fludarabine alone.

The regression equation was used to derive a probability of response based on the 4 characteristics.

PML/RAR-alpha fusion mRNAs are then transcribed and can be detected by a newly described reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. Using RT followed by nested PCR amplification for PML/RAR-alpha, we serially evaluated bone marrow aspirates from patients with APL who were treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) for induction, followed by all-trans RA as maintenance or cytotoxic drugs as consolidation. At diagnosis, PML/RAR-alpha mRNA was detected in all patients. After initial therapy with all-trans RA, the RT-PCR assay remained positive after induction of complete remission in 31 of 32 evaluable patients. Maintenance treatment by all-trans RA alone was associated with persistent assay positivity and subsequent clinical relapse in 13 of 13 patients. By contrast, the test became negative in 19 of 20 newly diagnosed patients who received consolidation chemotherapy; the 1 patient who remained positive relapsed at 12 months. Three of the 19 assay-negative patients later converted to positive and subsequently relapsed; the remaining 16 patients have remained RT-PCR negative in sustained first remission, with a median follow-up duration that exceeds 24 months (range, 12+ to 34+ months). Despite induction of complete remission in a high proportion of patients, all-trans RA rarely eradicates molecular evidence of disease in patients with APL; however, subsequent treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy frequently converts the RT-PCR assay for PML/RAR-alpha to negative. Serial negative tests are associated with prolonged disease-free survival, whereas persistence of a positive test after treatment is highly correlated with subsequent relapse. This test identifies patients in remission at high risk for relapse who may benefit from additional antileukemic therapy.","['Miller, W H Jr', 'Levine, K', 'DeBlasio, A', 'Frankel, S R', 'Dmitrovsky, E', 'Warrell, R P Jr']","['Miller WH Jr', 'Levine K', 'DeBlasio A', 'Frankel SR', 'Dmitrovsky E', 'Warrell RP Jr']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/analysis/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",1993/09/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78342-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 15;82(6):1689-94.,"['CA-57645/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'FD-R-000764/FD/FDA HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Deoxycytidine kinase kinase II had very low activity on ara-C as a substrate. We report a procedure for the purification of a novel deoxycytidine kinase (52 kDa) from isolated human peripheral blood leukemia cell mitochondria. This enzyme has activity similar to deoxycytidine kinase II. The enzyme was extracted from the mitochondria with digitonin (1 mg/8 mg protein) and 0.3 M NaCl, and the extract was purified by DEAE-cellulose chromatography and thymidine-Sepharose affinity chromatography. This procedure produced a near homogeneous enzyme preparation with a yield of 70%. The mitochondrial deoxycytidine kinase was localized to the outer mitochondrial membrane. The enzyme phosphorylated dCyd (Km = 17 microM), however, ara-C was not a good substrate for the mitochondrial deoxycytidine kinase. ATP was the best phosphate donor, whereas dCTP and dTTP were potent inhibitors of mitochondrial deoxycytidine kinase. In contrast, phosphorylation of ara-C by deoxycytidine kinase I utilized GTP, dGTP, or ATP as a phosphate donor.","['Wang, L M', 'Kucera, G L', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Wang LM', 'Kucera GL', 'Capizzi RL']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27157.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Nucleosides/pharmacology', 'Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Substrate Specificity']",1993/10/06 00:00,1993/10/06 00:01,['1993/10/06 00:00'],"['1993/10/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/06 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/06 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(93)90021-I [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(93)90021-i [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Oct 6;1202(2):309-16. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(93)90021-i.,['CA-12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Transport analysis revealed that cholate efflux in the variant L1210/C7 cell line had declined 8-fold, due to the loss of a bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux system, the major extrusion route for cholate in parental cells. Efflux measurements showed further that a bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux system for methotrexate was also absent in L1210/C7 cells. Total unidirectional efflux of methotrexate, however, was similar in the variant and parental cells, since the loss in the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive system was compensated by a rise in a second probenecid-sensitive route. The latter was identified from inhibitor studies to be the same system which acts as a minor efflux route for methotrexate in parental cells. These results support the hypothesis that L1210 cells contain a bromosulfophthalein-sensitive efflux system which mediates the unidirectional extrusion of either methotrexate or cholate, and a second probenecid-sensitive route which differs from the bromosulfophthalein-sensitive system in inhibitor specificity and also in its ability to transport methotrexate but not cholate.","['Henderson, G B', 'Hughes, T R']","['Henderson GB', 'Hughes TR']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Cholic Acids)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cholic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/10/10 00:00,1993/10/10 00:01,['1993/10/10 00:00'],"['1993/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(93)90235-R [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(93)90235-r [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Oct 10;1152(1):91-8. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(93)90235-r.,['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Reh cells were treated in vitro with TPA, bryo, or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) for a period of 5 days during which cells were analyzed for changes in growth patterns, morphology, cytochemistry, and surface phenotype. Bryo caused a dose-dependent growth inhibition of Reh cells. Morphologically, the treated cells expressed monocytoid features with development of filopodia and numerous vacuoles indicating phagocytic activity. Bryo induced similar phenotypic changes to TPA, including induction of CD11c, increased expression of CD22 and down-regulation of CD10 and CD19. Enzymatically, bryo, like TPA, induced tartrate-sensitive acid phosphatase expression but failed to induce periodic acid Schiff (PAS) and nonspecific esterase (NSE). Bryo inhibited the TPA action on NSE and CD10. IFN-alpha showed additive growth inhibitory and phenotypic effects to bryo. Collectively, our findings indicate that bryo is capable of inducing further differentiation of the Reh cells along the B cell lineage similar to those of TPA.","['al-Katib, A', 'Mohammad, R M', 'Khan, K', 'Dan, M E', 'Pettit, G R', 'Sensenbrenner, L L']","['al-Katib A', 'Mohammad RM', 'Khan K', 'Dan ME', 'Pettit GR', 'Sensenbrenner LL']","['Department of Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol,Journal of immunotherapy with emphasis on tumor immunology : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9418950,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Bryostatins', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Macrolides', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/physiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-199307000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1993 Jul;14(1):33-42. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199307000-00005.,"['CA-44344-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HS CA 22453/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'R29 CA-5071501A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, the anti-FeLV effect of IFN alpha was limited by the production of IFN alpha-neutralizing antibodies detected 7 weeks after the start of treatment. AZT without IFN alpha had no effect on circulating virus load. To examine the hypothesis that combination chemoimmunotherapy might induce the clearance of FeLV infection, persistently infected cats were infused with activated lymphocytes, IFN alpha, and AZT 12 weeks after infection with FeLV. Recipient cats received weekly infusions of 1.46 x 10(8) lymphocytes activated in vitro with lectin/IL-2 comprised of 98% T cells and an even distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes. FeLV infection was cleared in 4 of 9 cats receiving combined therapy after four adoptive cell transfers. These cats remained negative for circulating virus during a 63-day treatment period (17 adoptive cell transfers) despite the production of anti-IFN alpha-neutralizing antibodies. Sequential development of virus-neutralizing and virus envelope antibody titers were detected in those cats which cleared retroviremia, an antiviral response that was absent in untreated control animals or nonresponders. Three of four responder cats remained negative for FeLV 95 days after treatment was discontinued. Treatment of cats with lymphocytes without chemotherapy failed to influence the course of FeLV infection. These results suggest that combined treatment using IFN alpha and adoptive lymphocyte transfer served to reconstitute antiviral humoral immunity, counteract immunosuppression, and induce the reversal of retroviremia.","['Zeidner, N S', 'Mathiason-DuBard, C K', 'Hoover, E A']","['Zeidner NS', 'Mathiason-DuBard CK', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol,Journal of immunotherapy with emphasis on tumor immunology : official journal of the Society for Biological Therapy,9418950,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Cats', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feline Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Viremia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Zidovudine/administration & dosage']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-199307000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother Emphasis Tumor Immunol. 1993 Jul;14(1):22-32. doi: 10.1097/00002371-199307000-00004.,['N01 A1 72663/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Addition of human recombinant granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (rHu-GM-CSF) to HL-60 cells to induce differentiation into macrophages led to a time- and dose-dependent increase in both cell surface N-aminopeptidase and DPP IV activities. Protease up-regulation was due to an enhancement in cell surface protease number, associated with a slight rise in apparent affinities of the enzymes for their substrates. In contrast, in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate into neutrophils in the presence of retinoic acid, expression of cell surface N-aminopeptidases was almost completely abolished in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and this down-regulation was accompanied by a weak but significant decrease in affinity. However, no noticeable difference was seen in serine DPP IV expression between retinoic acid-treated and untreated HL-60 cells. Retinoic acid treatment also reduced soluble protease activity in vitro indicating that down-regulation of membrane aminopeptidases was not due to their proteolytic clip.

Attempts have been made to interfere with gene expression by in situ generation of mRNA from recombinant vectors (antisense RNA) or by the exogenous introduction of synthetic oligonucleotides (antisense oligonucleotides). Antisense oligonucleotides can inhibit the expression of specific genes by blocking the translation after hybridization with the target mRNAs--the antisense strategy. Antisense oligonucleotides can also be targeted to specific sequences of the DNA double helix. This causes inhibition of transcription--the antigene strategy. Regulatory sequences involved in controlling the transcription of oncogenes are used as targets for this type of 'antigene' oligonucleotide. Both strategies can be applied to control the oncogene expression of tumour cells in tissue culture, as exemplified in this review by myc antisense oligonucleotides. Recently the antisense strategy is moving into the area of clinical trials, aimed at curing chronic myelogenous leukaemia by ex vivo bone marrow purging.

M1 myeloblastic cells were chosen for this purpose because of their high growth sensitivity to interleukin 6 (IL-6), transforming growth factor beta 1 and alpha- and beta-interferons. It is reported here that IL-6 elevated the junB and c-jun mRNA levels and induced the formation of a novel DNA-protein complex with high sequence specificity to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element (TRE) oligonucleotides. This IL-6 induced TRE binding complex was abolished by anti-Jun specific antibodies and was efficiently competed by an oligonucleotide that comprises the mouse homologue of a previously described human c-myc negative DNA element. It persisted in cells for at least 48 h after IL-6 treatment and failed to be induced by alpha- and beta-interferons or by transforming growth factor beta 1, which affected differently the pattern of jun mRNA expression. To further explore regulatory and functional aspects of this induced TRE binding activity, an IL-6 resistant M1 clone was isolated and further analyzed. This clone carried a postreceptor deficiency that abrogated completely the growth inhibitory responses to IL-6 but did not interfere with the induction of two differentiation related cell surface markers. Interestingly, the IL-6 resistant clone had lost two molecular responses to IL-6, induction of TRE binding activity and suppression of the c-myc gene. The data correlate the IL-6 induced AP1 activity with the suppression of c-myc and growth inhibition.","['Melamed, D', 'Resnitzky, D', 'Haimov, I', 'Levy, N', 'Pfarr, C M', 'Yaniv, M', 'Kimchi, A']","['Melamed D', 'Resnitzky D', 'Haimov I', 'Levy N', 'Pfarr CM', 'Yaniv M', 'Kimchi A']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Genes, jun', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Aug;4(8):689-97.,,,"['c-jun', 'junB', 'junD']",,,,['Cell Growth Differ 1993 Nov;4(11):955'],,,

The present work describes the isolation of a U-937 cell variant, designated TUR, which is unresponsive to the growth-inhibitory effects of this agent. The results demonstrate that, in contrast to U-937 cells, the TUR line fails to respond to TPA with induction of the c-jun, junB, c-fos, and EGR-1 early response genes. The finding that these cells also fail to exhibit adherence or induction of the tumor necrosis factor and c-fms genes further supports their resistance to TPA-induced differentiation. In contrast, TUR cells responded to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, another inducer of monocytic differentiation, with growth arrest and induction of early response gene and c-fms transcripts. TUR cells also responded to okadaic acid, an inhibitor of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases, with similar changes in gene expression. Further characterization of TUR cells has demonstrated decreased expression of protein kinase C as compared to wild-type U-937 cells. We also demonstrate that although treatment of U-937 cells with TPA is associated with activation of the Raf-1 serine/threonine kinase, there was no detectable decrease in electrophoretic mobility of this protein in TPA-treated TUR cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the TUR variant is defective in TPA-induced signaling events upstream to activation of Raf-1 kinase.","['Hass, R', 'Hirano, M', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Rubin, E', 'Meinhardt, G', 'Kufe, D']","['Hass R', 'Hirano M', 'Kharbanda S', 'Rubin E', 'Meinhardt G', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Aug;4(8):657-63.,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Biol. Chem., 266: 12234-12241, 1991). In the present study, we describe several new properties of PO-B which suggest that the function of this transcription factor is not confined to regulation of gene expression in the pituitary. Furthermore, we present the first evidence for a signal transduction pathway that modulates the interactions of PO-B with DNA. We detected PO-B DNA binding activity in a number of mammalian cell lines (HeLa, C127, and AtT-20). However, PO-B was undetectable in extracts from undifferentiated HL-60 (U-HL-60) and CV-1 cells. Further characterization of these PO-B-negative extracts, by mixing experiments with PO-B-positive extracts, revealed that the U-HL-60 extracts, but not CV-1, contained enzymatic activity capable of increasing the mobility of the PO-B-DNA complex on nondenaturing gels. Concomitantly, there was also a reduction in the overall amount of PO-B bound to its cognate element. Immunoprecipitation with an antiserum to the protein kinase ERK 1 removed the modulatory activity from the U-HL-60 extracts, as did incubation with an ERK substrate peptide. Whole cell extracts from HL-60 cells which had been treated for 96 h with the macrophage-differentiating phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate contained no modulatory activity. Furthermore, PO-B could be detected in these extracts. We conclude that an ERK or ERK-regulated protein in U-HL-60 cellular extracts regulates PO-B DNA binding and that some portion of the increase in PO-B DNA binding during HL-60 differentiation may arise from alterations in this regulatory activity.","['Dobrenski, A F', 'Zeft, A S', 'Wellstein, A', 'Riegel, A T']","['Dobrenski AF', 'Zeft AS', 'Wellstein A', 'Riegel AT']","['Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University School of Medicine, Washington, DC 20007.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Extracts/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Aug;4(8):647-56.,"['DK02141/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK43127/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'MH10114/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We reported previously that OM strongly up-regulated low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in human liver cells by a tyrosine kinase-mediated mechanism. Now, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Egr-1 is induced by OM. The induction of Egr-1 was time and concentration dependent; maximal inductions of 10-fold occurred by 30 min at concentrations of 10-25 ng/ml and higher. This concentration dependency was identical to those for OM-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and LDL receptor up-regulation. The Egr-1, tyrosine kinase, and LDL receptor responses were inhibited at similar concentrations of genistein, suggesting that induction of Egr-1 and up-regulation of LDL receptors depended on activation of tyrosine kinase by OM. In contrast, depletion of protein kinase C by preincubation with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13 alpha-acetate did not affect OM-mediated induction of Egr-1 or up-regulation of LDL receptors, indicating that protein kinase C is not required for the OM action. Other similar cytokines were investigated, and, of these, only interleukin 1 could increase both Egr-1 and LDL receptor activity. The correlation among tyrosine kinase phosphorylation, Egr-1 induction, and LDL receptor regulation suggests that Egr-1 may be a nuclear signal transducer utilized by OM to induce transcription of the LDL receptor gene. In support of this possibility is the discovery of an Egr-1 consensus sequence (GAGGGGGCG) at approximately 330 base pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site of the LDL receptor promoter region.","['Liu, J', 'Shoyab, M', 'Grove, R I']","['Liu J', 'Shoyab M', 'Grove RI']","['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 98121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (EGR1 protein, human)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1', 'Humans', '*Immediate-Early Proteins', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, LDL/*drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'Zinc Fingers']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Jul;4(7):611-6.,,,,,,,,,,

These studies may, however, not be representative if there is a publication bias where mainly positive results are reported. To study an unselected population the incidence of cancer was followed up over a 17 year period (1970-87) in a cohort of 2.8 million Danes aged 20-64 years in 1970. Each person was classified by his or her industry and occupation in 1970. Before tabulation of the data on incidence of cancer, each industry-occupation group was coded for potential exposure to magnetic fields above the threshold 0.3 microT. Some 154,000 men were considered intermittently exposed and 18,000 continuously exposed. The numbers for women were 79,000 and 4000 respectively. Intermittent exposure was not associated with an increased risk of leukaemia, brain tumours, or melanoma. Men with continuous exposure, however, had an excess risk of leukaemia (observed (obs) 39, expected (exp) 23.80, obs/exp 1.64, 95% CI 1.20-2.24) with equal contributions from acute and other leukaemias.

This 10 year update was conducted to verify previous findings of excesses of cancer among the 278 men assigned to the chlorohydrin unit, which primarily produced ethylene chlorohydrin from 1925 to 1957. This process produced ethylene dichloride and bischloroethyl ether as byproducts. Mean duration of assignment was 5.9 years and mean duration of follow up was 36.5 years. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated based on comparisons with the United States white male population. Duration-response trends were assessed by internal comparisons with two different groups of unexposed chemical workers in the Kanawha Valley. The evidence that the earlier finding of an excess of pancreatic cancer was work related is strengthened by the occurrence of two additional cases (0.9 expected). The SMR for pancreatic cancer was 492 (95% CI 158-1140), based on eight observed v 1.6 expected deaths. There were no additional deaths due to leukaemia, but the three to four-fold excess risk for lymphopoietic cancers persisted due to new cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and a death from multiple myeloma. The SMR for lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers was 294 (eight observed v 2.7 expected; 95% CI 127-580). Pronounced increases in risk were seen for total cancer, pancreatic cancer, all lymphatic and haematopoietic cancers, and leukaemia with increasing durations of assignment to the chlorohydrin unit. Most of the cases were first assigned to the unit in the 1930s when chemical manufacturing was in its infancy and exposures were less controlled. These data are insufficient to identify conclusively the causative agent or agents. The weight of evidence, however, based on probable exposure, known toxicity of the chemicals, and animal responses suggest that high exposures to ethylene dichloride, perhaps in combination with other chlorinated hydrocarbons, is the most likely explanation.","['Benson, L O', 'Teta, M J']","['Benson LO', 'Teta MJ']","['Whitehall Laboratories, New York, New York 10017-4076.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,['0 (Chlorohydrins)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Chemical Industry', 'Chlorohydrins/*adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic System', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality', 'Lymphatic Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'West Virginia/epidemiology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/oem.50.8.710 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1993 Aug;50(8):710-6. doi: 10.1136/oem.50.8.710.,,,,,,,,,PMC1012174,

However, there may be differences in the pattern of VH4 gene usage between these disorders as is the case for VH1 gene rearrangements. To examine this, we analysed the sequences of 24 PCR-amplified clonal VH4 gene rearrangements from a series of 15 cases of ALL and nine cases of CLL. Five distinct groups of genes were rearranged, three of which (represented by V2-1, V71-2/V71-4, V4.21) have been described in rearranged form in normal B lymphoid tissues. The most frequently rearranged gene was V4.21 which is strongly associated with autoimmune reactivity. V71-2, V71-4 and V2-1 were more frequently rearranged in CLL than ALL. The remaining two groups (represented by V4.33, V4.35) have not previously been described in rearranged form. One of these, V4.35, was seen only in ALL rearrangements. Both V4.35 and a VH1 gene, 20P3, which is also preferentially rearranged in ALL, are located at the 3' end of the VH locus. The location of these genes suggests that their rearrangement may be developmentally regulated in ALL. The findings in this study confirm restricted repertoires of IgH gene rearrangement in ALL and CLL. Characterization of IgH repertoires provides a means of correlating these transformed B cell populations with normal B cell developmental compartments. Moreover, the distinctive repertoires in ALL and CLL may reflect important differences in the ontogenic timing and microenvironmental milieu of tumourigenesis in these disorders.","['Deane, M', 'Baker, B W', 'Norton, J D']","['Deane M', 'Baker BW', 'Norton JD']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03059.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1993 Jun;84(2):242-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1993.tb03059.x.,,,['V<down>H</down>4'],,,,,,,

An annual total of 3392 cancer deaths were seen among children in the EC during the period 1979-1988, yielding an age-standardised cancer mortality rate of 50 per 10(6). Leukaemia was the most prevalent cause of death among children with cancer (39%). Excess mortality was observed among boys for cancers at all sites combined and for cancers at specific sites, exclusive of malignant tumours of the kidney. This excess is presumed to be due mainly to sex differences in incidence. Markedly higher mortality rates of childhood cancer were seen in southern countries of the EC than in central and northern countries. This difference appeared to be due mainly to differences in cancer incidence among the countries and to a lesser degree to differences in treatment and survival. An overall decline in mortality from childhood cancer in the EC occurred from the early 1960s. In spite of the improvements in survival, however, childhood cancer remains a major cause of death in the EC, affecting about 15% of children between the ages of 1 and 14.","['Martos, M C', 'Olsen, J H']","['Martos MC', 'Olsen JH']","['Danish Cancer Registry, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'European Union', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality/trends', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Sex Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0959-8049(93)90126-z [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(12):1783-9. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90126-z.,,,,,,,,,,

Animal experiments have shown that ara-C enhances the effect of radiation on the spinal cord when administered shortly before irradiation, and that the long-term recovery after a combined treatment may be impaired. In the present experiments immature, 3-week-old rats, were treated with ara-C and radiation on the cervical spinal cord, and the long-term recovery was examined by reirradiation after different intervals. The endpoint of the study was paresis due to radiation myelopathy. The results showed a clear enhancement of the radiation effect with a dose-modifying factor of 1.2, when ara-C was administered before irradiation. However, no indications for impaired long-term recovery were observed. Additional experiments in adult rats with ara-C treatments during a 6-month interval between two radiation doses also did not suggest any interference between ara-C treatment and long-term recovery of radiation induced injury. It is concluded that for both the adult and immature nervous tissue, only when ara-C is administered intraspinally shortly before irradiation, interaction between ara-C and radiation results in a significant reduction of the isoeffective radiation dose by a factor of 1.2 (1.13-1.37, 95% confidence interval).","['Ruifrok, A C', 'van der Kogel, A J']","['Ruifrok AC', 'van der Kogel AJ']","['Institute of Radiotherapy, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Paresis/etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Tolerance/*drug effects', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Spinal Cord/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90121-U [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90121-u [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(12):1766-70. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90121-u.,,,,,,,,,,

Murine leukaemia L1210 cells were exposed to various antimetabolites under non-lethal conditions. The antimetabolites 5-fluorouracil (5FU), arabinofuranosylcytosine (AraC), methotrexate (MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), but not 6-thioguanine, induced considerable changes in the metabolic incorporation of radioactively labelled monosaccharides. Each antimetabolite exhibited a different effect. Significant differences were found between the radioactivity incorporated from the monosaccharides glucosamine, fucose, mannose and galactose, relative to control values. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that changes were induced in the glycosylation of individual glycoproteins. 5FU, AraC, MTX and 6MP all influenced both pyrimidine- and purine-mediated sugar incorporation. This excludes, therefore, direct effects of the antimetabolites on their analogue nucleotide-sugars.

As such, methods attempting to block the production or activity of IL-1 have now entered clinical trials. For example, IL-1 induction of prostaglandins is one target in treating disease, and drugs preventing the production of inhibiting cyclooxygenase have well-known toxicities because they block the normal synthesis of prostaglandins in many tissues.

The effects on cell growth, differentiation and beta-adrenergic response were followed during the culture period of 72 h.

When the cells were exposed to EPI (1 nM-10 microM) for 72 h, a dose-dependent increase of cAMP levels with a maximum of 60% above basal levels. Sustained exposure to EPI generated a dose-dependent desensitization of the beta-adrenergic signal system. After EPI treatment for 72 h, IPR (10 microM for 3 min) in the presence of theophylline (4 mM) increased cAMP-levels by only 80% above baseline level (cAMP levels after maintained exposure to EPI), compared to 1080% above unstimulated level in control cells. The alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker PHENT (10 microM) did not affect baseline cAMP level or IPR-dependent cAMP response, but a mixture of EPI and PHENT increased the response to IPR. The HL-60 cell growth was not influenced by EPI. However, after repeated exposure to EPI for 72 h a concentration-dependent increase of HL-60 differentiation was demonstrated. Differentiation was not influenced by PHENT.

Res. 127, 146-149, 1991), the three most frequent types were analyzed for myeloperoxidase, c-myc, c-myb, and c-fos mRNAs. It was shown by in situ hybridization that all the component cells were positive for myeloperoxidase mRNA in granulocytic leukemia, whereas only half the cells were positive in myelomonocytic leukemia and none in monocytic leukemia. Granulocytic leukemia was also characterized by a persistently heightened expression of c-fos, while the other two types of leukemia showed negligibly low expression of the c-fos message. By contrast, both c-myc and c-myb were expressed to a similar extent in all three types of leukemia. When fresh granulocytic leukemia cells were transferred to culture in a medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, c-fos mRNA was decreased rapidly during incubation. The decay of c-fos mRNA was inhibited by cycloheximide markedly but was not changed significantly by actinomycin D. In the culture containing 10% fetal calf serum, the rate of decay of c-fos mRNA was slowed down significantly. Addition of dibutyryl cyclic AMP rapidly restored the c-fos expression and kept it elevated for at least 2 h in the cultured granulocytic leukemia cells. Phorbol ester (TPA) and calcium ionophore A23187 also caused a rapid but transient c-fos expression. A transient c-fos expression was inducible by TPA in the other two types of leukemia cells and in the granulocytic leukemia cells. The results suggest that the persistent expression of c-fos is distinguished from its transient expression and is characteristic for granulocytic leukemia cells as it is for normal mature granulocytes.","['Ishihara, H', 'Yoshida, K', 'Nemoto, K', 'Tsuneoka, K', 'Shikita, M']","['Ishihara H', 'Yoshida K', 'Nemoto K', 'Tsuneoka K', 'Shikita M']","['Division of Chemical Pharmacology, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba-shi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, fos', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Peroxidase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1993 Sep;135(3):394-9.,,,['c-fos'],,,,,,,

In five primary tumors, expression was substantially elevated with respect to expression in contiguous normal tissue. Expression in chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia cells was far greater than in normal blood cells and increased with progression of disease. In liver material, the highest level of p18 was found in a primary hepatoblastoma, a stem cell tumor, whereas a benign adenoma demonstrated very low level expression. Cells from a cleaved B cell lymphoma/leukemia failed to express p18 whereas 18 specimens from other B lymphoid malignancies, including a second cleaved cell malignancy, expressed p18 at substantial levels. These data are consistent with p18 playing a role in control of cell proliferation in at least certain tissues.

RNA blot analysis of murine hematopoietic tissues and cells lines indicated that Mpl is expressed in immature hematopoietic precursor cells. Molecular cloning of murine proto-oncogene c-Mpl cDNAs is also reported. Two cDNA species were isolated. One potentially encodes a transmembrane protein. The extracellular domain of this protein has two repeats of the cytokine receptor domain common to all members of this receptor family. The cytoplasmic domain has no protein kinase or phosphatase motifs, but does contain a sequence that has been shown to be essential for the transmission of a growth signal in several other members of the family. Comparison of murine and human putative proteins indicated that they shared 81% amino acid identity, the most conserved region being the cytoplasmic domain (91% identity). The other Mpl cDNA clones potentially encode a soluble form of this receptor chain. A chimeric receptor containing the extracellular domain of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor fused to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of Mpl was able to induce G-CSF responsiveness when transfected into the interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent cell line BAF/BO3.

The lack of viral expression has been attributed to a plasma blocking factor capable of inhibiting the in vitro expression of the BLV p24 antigen. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of plasma and serum on the in vitro synthesis of the p24 antigen within short-term cultures of PBMCs from BLV-seropositive cows. BLV p24 antigen was detected in the cell lysate using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: Antigen synthesis was suppressed in PBMCs cultured in plasma from both seropositive and seronegative cows. Serum from infected cows suppressed p24 expression, but to a lesser extent than any of the plasmas. Addition of phytohemagglutinin-P to the cultures resulted in the detection of more p24 in PBMCs cultured in serum, but had no effect on p24 expression within cells cultured in plasma. The reduction in p24 was not related to lower cell viability, nor was it influenced by the effects of the anticoagulant citrate-phosphate dextrose on calcium-dependent lymphocyte activation. No significant difference was observed in the potency of the p24 inhibition between cells grown in autologous and homologous serum, or between cells grown in autologous and homologous plasma from seropositive cows. CONCLUSIONS: Blocking activity is present in the plasma of seronegative cows, and in the plasma and serum of BLV-seropositive cows. This activity may be important in regulating viral latency and provirus expression in vivo.","['Taylor, J A', 'Jacobs, R M']","['Taylor JA', 'Jacobs RM']","['Department of Pathology, University of Guelph, Ontario.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Blood', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Culture Techniques/methods', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/growth & development/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*cytology/microbiology', 'Plasma']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lab Invest. 1993 Sep;69(3):340-6.,,,,,,,,,,

The so-called adaptive immune therapy bases on the fact that patients who present with a low grade of GvHD less often suffer from a relapse of the malignant leukaemic disease. Therefore, new therapeutic regimen are now performed which keep the patient on a low level of GvHD to prevent a recurrence of leukaemia. Here a close cooperation of oncologists and ophthalmologists becomes more and more important to estimate the stage of GvHD. PATIENTS: Demonstrating two case reports, we report on the ophthalmological symptoms of acute and chronic GvHD. Both patients presented with acute ocular GvHD as well as with signs of chronic ocular GvHD. Concerning the ophthalmological symptoms, in acute or chronic GvHD the conjunctival involvement is most important. There is a lymphocytic infiltration of the conjunctiva and of the lacrimal glands which leads to an extreme sicca-syndrome. The acute GvHD of the conjunctiva can be classified into 4 stages: injection/exudation and chemosis/formation of pseudomembranes/defects of the corneal epithelium. These stages correlate directly to the prognosis of the survival time of the patient. A pathognomonic sign for the chronic GvHD of the conjunctiva are the fibrous-scarry Arlt-lines of the tarsal conjunctiva. CONCLUSIONS: All patients who underwent a bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia need to be followed up closely to estimate the level of GvHD they are in. This applies especially to those patients who are treated according to the regimen of adaptive immune therapy. A close cooperation of oncologists and ophthalmologists during adaptive immune therapy is mandatory, as the ophthalmologist can provide important information to help to grade the level of GvHD, judging by the morphological picture at the slit lamp.","['Kasmann, B', 'Ruprecht, K W']","['Kasmann B', 'Ruprecht KW']","['Augenklinik und Poliklinik, Universitat des Saarlandes.']",['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd,Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,0014133,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Conjunctivitis/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Corneal Ulcer/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Keratoplasty, Penetrating', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Patient Care Team', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Retinitis/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/diagnosis/immunology/therapy""]",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1045634 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Monbl Augenheilkd. 1993 Jun;202(6):491-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1045634.,,,,,,,,Ophthalmologische Befunde bei Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD).,,

Receptor dynamics in IgE-mediated signal transduction.,3237-51,"Transmembrane signaling initiated by the receptor with high affinity for Fc stem of IgE(Fc epsilon RI) requires the diffusion-dependent cross-linkage and persistent aggregation of the Fc epsilon RI. Disruption or prevention of receptor cross-links at any time during the secretory response quickly terminates secretion. We found that in the rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line, addition of wheat germ agglutinin, a lectin that binds to the Fc epsilon RI alpha subunit, caused a precipitous decline in the lateral diffusional and electrokinetic mobilities of the Fc epsilon RI. Both the unoccupied Fc epsilon RI and IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes became immobilized, as determined from in situ electromigration and postelectric field relaxation. Immobilization of the Fc epsilon RI by wheat germ agglutinin was accompanied by a ligand-reversible association of 125I-IgE-Fc epsilon RI complexes with the Triton X-100-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. Wheat germ agglutinin rapidly inhibited Fc epsilon RI-mediated signal transduction and secretion, whether cross-linkage was initiated by multivalent antigen, covalent IgE oligomers, anti-IgE, or anti-Fc epsilon RI antibody. Inhibition of signaling and secretion occurred on simultaneous addition of wheat germ agglutinin and antigen, and also when wheat germ agglutinin was added at increasing times after induction of Fc epsilon RI cross-linkage. Wheat germ agglutinin neither reduced the affinity of anti-DNP IgE for haptenic DNP-lysine nor reversed the binding of IgE to the Fc epsilon RI. Although wheat germ agglutinin caused internalization of the Fc epsilon RI, the onset of inhibition preceded and its extent exceeded that of internalization. Wheat germ agglutinin did not interfere with the secretory apparatus, as indicated by its lack of inhibition of secretion elicited by calcium ionophores. These findings suggest that inhibition of signal transduction is secondary to an initial event linked to immobilization of the Fc epsilon RI. Implications of these results are discussed with respect to the dynamics of Fc epsilon RI aggregation on rat basophilic leukemia cells.","['McCloskey, M A']",['McCloskey MA'],"['Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames 50011-3223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Wheat Germ Agglutinins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Haptens/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fluidity', 'Rats', 'Receptor Aggregation', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/*metabolism', 'beta-N-Acetylhexosaminidases/metabolism']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Sep 15;151(6):3237-51.,['GM35901/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Anti-mu treatment of murine B lymphocytes stimulated with LPS provides a model system in which proliferation and differentiation may be independently studied. This treatment causes enhanced proliferation but with coordinate suppression of transcription of a family of unrelated genes including those for Ig heavy and light chains, J chain, and endogenous murine leukemia virus (MuLV) sequences. We show that in comparison to B lymphocytes stimulated with LPS alone cells stimulated with a combination of anti-mu and LPS exhibit relatively increased amounts of a nuclear binding factor(s), NF mu E1, which interacts with the B (mu E1) site of the IgH enhancer; binding is strongly inhibited by a synthetic probe of the B sequence. A negative regulatory sequence contained within the upstream conserved region (UCR) of the MuLV long terminal repeat (LTR) is identical to the complement of mu E1 in eight of nine bases and inhibits binding of NF mu E1 to the IgH enhancer probe. The mu E1 site is also present 3' to the kappa-light chain gene; binding of this sequence to a repressor protein may coordinately suppress the transcription of mu, kappa, and MuLV genes. Others have reported that the cDNA encoding NF mu E1, also known as mu EBP-B, CF-1, and YY-1, predicts a protein with structural features consistent with variable function as either a transcriptional activator or repressor.","['Hummell, D S', 'Dooley, J S', 'Khan, A S', 'Lawton, A R']","['Hummell DS', 'Dooley JS', 'Khan AS', 'Lawton AR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232-2580.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Sep 15;151(6):3131-9.,['AI-23766/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In a subanalysis from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of itraconazole on the prevention of fungal infections in neutropenic patients, we studied the effects of itraconazole on remission rate and disease-free survival in patients with acute lymphoblastic (ALL) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) receiving remission induction treatment schedules containing daunorubicin (DNR). Eleven ALL and 17 AML patients received itraconazole and 12 ALL and 25 AML patients were given placebo. Among AML patients the remission rate was slightly higher in the itraconazole group, whereas the disease-free survival was higher among ALL patients given itraconazole. In AML patients DFS was comparable in both groups but the number of high-risk patients in the itraconazole group was higher. These preliminary results may suggest a role for itraconazole in reversing multidrug resistance.

We show here that, in the absence of HCO3-, the Na+/H+ exchanger is the predominant mechanism involved in rapid recovery of pHi from cytoplasmic acidosis; however, in the presence of HCO3-, other mechanisms also contribute to pHi homeostasis. In the absence of HCO3-, dimethyl sulfoxide and 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13 alpha-acetate result in an acute activation of antiport activity, whereas all-trans-retinoic acid, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, gamma-interferon, and tumor necrosis factor alpha do not. Furthermore, whether or not HCO3- is present, the amiloride analogue, 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride, a potent and more specific antiport inhibitor than the parent compound, failed to suppress HL60 cell proliferation or the decreased proliferation in response to dimethyl sulfoxide, all-trans-retinoic acid, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, gamma-interferon, or tumor necrosis factor alpha. In the absence of HCO3-, 5-N,N-dimethylamiloride also had little effect on the ability of these agents to induce functional maturation as assessed by acquisition of respiratory burst activity. Inhibition of antiport activity also did not prevent 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13 alpha-acetate-induced expression of c-fos mRNA or cell adherence. The results suggest that, even under conditions in which the Na+/H+ exchanger is the predominant operable pHi regulator, antiport activity is not required for HL60 proliferation or differentiation.","['Vairo, G', 'Hamilton, J A']","['Vairo G', 'Hamilton JA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Bicarbonates)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '3GC547293P (5-dimethylamiloride)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7DZO8EB0Z3 (Amiloride)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Amiloride/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Bicarbonates/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Jun;4(6):461-6.,,,"['c-fos', 'c-myc']",,,,,,,

In CEM/DOX cells, which are resistant to doxorubicin, the topoisomerase I gene was found to be 4-fold overexpressed and nuclear topoisomerase I relaxation activity was 2-fold greater in CEM/DOX than in CEM cells. Furthermore, the cleavable complex reaction induced by camptothecin, a specific topoisomerase I inhibitor, was found to be 2.5-increased in the presence of topoisomerase I extracted from CEM/DOX, in comparison to that in CEM cells. Conversely, the topoisomerase II mRNA levels, nuclear decatenation activities and (mAMSA) 4'(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide-induced cleavable complex formation in CEM/DOX were similar to those of the doxorubicin-sensitive cells. The results indicate that topoisomerase I activity is elevated in CEM/DOX cells. Nevertheless, CEM/DOX cells were 11-fold more resistant to camptothecin than were CEM cells, and cross-resistance to camptothecin was not reversed by verapamil. Furthermore, using an intact cell assay for DNA-protein complexes, we found that camptothecin-stimulated cleavable complexes formed in CEM/DOX cells were increased in correlation with the elevated topoisomerase I activity. These results suggest that camptothecin resistance in CEM/DOX cells is due to different mechanism(s) than topoisomerase- or P-glycoprotein-associated multidrug resistance. The recombination activating gene, RAG1, which is one of the components of the site-specific V(D)J recombination complex, was 20-fold overexpressed in CEM/DOX cells. In contrast, RAG2 and T160 gene transcripts, other components of the V(D)J complex, were at best poorly detected in both sensitive and resistant cells. No specific V(D)J recombinase activity was found in CEM or CEM/DOX cells when the pJH201 transfection assay was used. The results indicate that CEM/DOX cells failed to generate V(D)J recombination although RAG1 gene is overexpressed. The mechanism of the RAG1 gene activation was not gene amplification, and no rearrangement was detected in the RAG1 gene locus. RAG1 presents homology with the yeast gene HPR1, itself homologous to yeast topoisomerase I and responsible for the control of recombination in somatic cells. Since DNA topoisomerases are themselves involved in the control of DNA topology, recombination and DNA repair, the possible coactivation of RAG1 and topoisomerase I genes in CEM/DOX cells is discussed.","['Riou, J F', 'Grondard, L', 'Petitgenet, O', 'Abitbol, M', 'Lavelle, F']","['Riou JF', 'Grondard L', 'Petitgenet O', 'Abitbol M', 'Lavelle F']","['Departement Biologie, Centre de Recherche de Vitry-Alfortville, Vitry-sur-Seine, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, RAG-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90494-H [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90494-h [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Sep 1;46(5):851-61. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90494-h.,,,['mdr1'],,,,,,,

Flow cytometric studies revealed a predominance of T cells without definite evidence of T cell neoplasia. Frozen section immunophenotyping studies revealed a T cell phenotype with aberrant expression, and genotypic studies demonstrated T cell receptor beta gene rearrangement with germline configuration of immunoglobulin heavy chain and kappa light chain genes, confirming a T lineage. EBV-encoded RNA transcripts were demonstrated within the neoplastic cells by in situ hybridization. Southern blot analysis using probes derived from the terminal repeat region of the virus detected a single restriction band indicating a clonal population.

We have examined the involvement of flvi-2 and myc in natural and experimentally induced FeLV-positive feline lymphosarcomas which are heterogeneous in anatomical origin, geographic origin, and strain of FeLV involved. We further compared these findings with previous reports of novel FeLV env genes in the same tumors. The results show that proviral insertion at flvi-2 occurs commonly in natural and experimental feline thymic lymphosarcomas of diverse origins [52% overall], and that alterations in c-myc commonly accompany insertional mutagenesis of flvi-2 [54% overall]. However, 46% of tumors with flvi-2 insertions apparently lack involvement of c-myc. These observations support the hypothesis that interruption of flvi-2 may be an early event in a multistep cascade, one possibility for completion of which is activation of c-myc. Interruption of flvi-2 was not observed in nonthymic lymphosarcomas of alimentary or multicentric origin, although c-myc may be involved. A proportion of both thymic and nonthymic tumors have been shown previously to contain FeLV proviruses with recombinant or mutant env genes. Our findings strongly implicate the insertional mutagenesis of flvi-2, the activation of c-myc, and the emergence of novel env genes in FeLV-mediated lymphomagenesis, particularly in the induction of thymic lymphosarcoma.

Fit-1 represents a novel common proviral integration region which may harbor a cellular gene which acts in concert with the myc gene in T-cell tumorigenesis.","['Tsujimoto, H', 'Fulton, R', 'Nishigaki, K', 'Matsumoto, Y', 'Hasegawa, A', 'Tsujimoto, A', 'Cevario, S', ""O'Brien, S J"", 'Terry, A', 'Onions, D']","['Tsujimoto H', 'Fulton R', 'Nishigaki K', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Hasegawa A', 'Tsujimoto A', 'Cevario S', ""O'Brien SJ"", 'Terry A', 'Onions D', 'et al.']","['Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/genetics', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Virus Integration/*genetics']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682283715448 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1544 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Oct;196(2):845-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1544.,,,,,,,,,,

Among five NHL biopsies examined, four biopsies contained both A and B types of EBV, while one revealed A type-virus only. This co-infection of Algerian HD and NHL patients does not seem to be related with any histologic form of these diseases. The analysis of viral types in the saliva from 12 Algerian healthy individuals revealed six EBV positives with only one A type.

Levels of MPO RNA, protein, and enzyme activity differ, usually in a concordant fashion, among the various classes of acute leukemia and among different cases within a particular class. One portion of the gene thought to be involved in regulation of MPO expression is the proximal 5' flanking region. To determine if mutations in this putatively regulatory region of the MPO gene might be responsible for some of the differences in level of MPO expression among different cases or classes of acute leukemia, we compared the nucleotide sequence of this part of the gene from 16 patients with acute leukemia, with DNA from normal human bone marrow cells and selected other neoplasms and cell lines. The sequence of this regulatory region was found to be identical in cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with tha of normal DNA except for a dA to dG transition in the Alu region, 463 bases upstream from the transcription start site. This base substitution was seen in almost all cases of AML studied, regardless of the level of MPO which they expressed. It was absent from normal human DNA obtained from various tissues, and cases of acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, carcinoma of lung, and most cell lines examined. The base substitution was also absent in a remission blood sample from one of the cases which showed the dA to dG transition in leukemic marrow, suggesting that the base substitution is a mutation rather than a polymorphism. Our results suggest that mutations in promoter or enhancer DNA are not an important cause of the differences in level of MPO gene expression seen among different cases or different classes of AML. However, the base substitution we have detected could potentially serve as a useful marker for detection of residual disease in patients with AML following treatment.","['Austin, G E', 'Lam, L', 'Zaki, S R', 'Chan, W C', 'Hodge, T', 'Hou, J', 'Swan, D', 'Zhang, W', 'Racine, M', 'Whitsett, C']","['Austin GE', 'Lam L', 'Zaki SR', 'Chan WC', 'Hodge T', 'Hou J', 'Swan D', 'Zhang W', 'Racine M', 'Whitsett C', 'et al.']","['Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Service (113), Atlanta VA Medical Center, Decatur, GA 30033.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Sep;7(9):1445-50.,,,,,,,,,,

Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay we have determined type I 60 kDa sTNF-R levels in the sera of 45 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects and 106 patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD). HD patients were either previously untreated (n = 76) or were in complete remission for at least 3 years after remission induction treatment (n = 30). The mean +/- SD concentrations of the 60 kDa type sTNF-R were significantly higher in HD patients than in healthy controls (1.32 +/- 0.19 ng/ml versus 0.6 +/- 0.13 ng/ml; p < 0.001). The extent of increase correlated with the disease stage.

These traits are not characteristic of the progenitor strains (C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ) or of 11 other recombinant inbred BXH strains. Genetic analysis has shown that the virus is not transmitted through the germ line, suggesting that the virus is passed from one generation to the next by horizontal transmission. An additional ecotropic proviral locus was detected in some mice of this strain after several generations of inbreeding. We show that BXH ecotropic virus was transmitted to other strains when fostered on viremic BXH-2 mice and that these mice go on to develop tumors of hematopoietic origin. Our earlier finding that virus is expressed early in gestation suggested that the ecotropic MuLV is also transmitted in utero. In order to determine the stage at which the ecotropic MuLV is transmitted in utero, preimplantation stage embryos were transferred to the uteri of recipient ecotropic virus-negative mice. These mice were found to be negative for the presence of the ecotropic MuLV, suggesting that transplacental transmission of the ecotropic virus readily occurs in BXH-2 mice. Although other viruses, including human lentiviruses, are transmitted across the placental barrier, transplacental transmission of MuLV is a rare event. Thus, the BXH-2 mouse strain may contribute to our understanding of the mechanism of transplacental transmission and pathogenesis and offers a potential new model for use in drug therapy of exogenously transmitted viruses related to lentiviruses.","['Bedigian, H G', 'Shepel, L A', 'Hoppe, P C']","['Bedigian HG', 'Shepel LA', 'Hoppe PC']","['Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Female', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Milk/microbiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*microbiology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Species Specificity']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.10.6105-6109.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Oct;67(10):6105-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.10.6105-6109.1993.,"['CA-31102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC238032,

To determine whether BCR-ABL kinases are inefficient in transforming T lymphocytes, BCR-ABL-expressing retroviruses were injected intrathymically into mice. Thymomas that expressed BCR-ABL kinase developed after a relatively long latent period. In most thymomas, deletion of 3' proviral sequences resulted in loss of tk-neo and occasionally caused expression of kinase-active carboxy-terminally truncated BCR-ABL oncoprotein. In contrast, deletion of 3' proviral sequences was not observed in thymomas induced with Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV). BCR-ABL viruses induced distinct patterns of disease and involved different thymocyte subsets than A-MuLV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). While Mo-MuLV only induced Thy-1+ thymomas, v-abl- and BCR-ABL-induced thymomas often contained mixed populations of B220+ and Thy-1+ lymphocytes in the same tumor. In most v-abl and BCR-ABL tumors, Thy-1+ lymphoid cells expressed CD8 and a continuum of CD4 ranging from negative to positive. Conversely, Mo-MuLV thymomas contained distinct populations of CD4+ cells that were either CD8+ or CD8-. A-MuLV-transformed T-lymphoid cells did not express the CD3/T-cell receptor complex, while BCR-ABL tumors were CD3+. Thus, BCR-ABL viruses preferentially induce somewhat more differentiated T lymphocytes than are transformed by A-MuLV.

Restriction digest mapping suggests that TR1.3 is part of the Friend murine leukemia virus (FMuLV) family. However, unlike mice exposed to other FMuLVs, mice infected with TR1.3 virus developed tremors and seizures within 8 to 18 days postinoculation. This was uniformly followed by paralysis and death within 1 to 2 days. Postmortem examination of TR1.3-inoculated mice revealed edematous brain tissue with large areas of intracerebral hemorrhage.

Overbaugh, E. A. Hoover, J. I. Mullins, D. P. W. Burns, L. Rudensey, S. L. Quackenbush, V. Stallard, and P. R. Donahue, Virology 188:558-569, 1992). Infection of the 3201 feline T-cell line with 61B plus helper virus also results in longer time from infection to cytopathic effect compared with 61C plus helper virus, providing an in vitro system with which to study the mechanism for this difference. We report that the primary determinant of cytopathicity of 61B maps to gp70, the extracellular envelope glycoprotein. The long latency of 61B, on the other hand, maps to the extracellular portion of the envelope transmembrane protein, in which there are only four predicted amino acid differences between 61B and 61C. These differences render 61B replication defective, and two of the predicted amino acid changes lie in a region that is highly conserved among many retroviruses. The eventual onset of 61B cytopathicity in cell culture was associated with the outgrowth of an apparent recombinant virus that encodes the pathogenic gp70 of 61B and replaces the transmembrane protein of 61B with that of the helper virus. Thus, during in vitro infection, a cytopathic virus evolved from a replication-defective virus and a nonpathogenic virus, suggesting that recombination between multiple variants in natural infection may influence progression of feline leukemia virus-associated immunodeficiency disease.","['Thomas, E', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Thomas E', 'Overbaugh J']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Defective Viruses/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Virulence/*genetics', 'Virus Replication']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.10.5724-5732.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Oct;67(10):5724-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.10.5724-5732.1993.,"['AI07140/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['gag', 'pol']",,,,,,PMC237989,

They are localized on a previously unknown gene, PML, on chromosome 15 and in the gene that encodes the alpha retinoic acid receptor (RAR alpha) on 17. The translocation, which is balanced and reciprocal, leads to the formation of two fusion genes, PML/RAR alpha and RAR alpha/PML. Both are expressed in APL. The PML/RAR alpha gene codes for two abnormal proteins: the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein and an abnormal PML protein, the RAR alpha/PML gene encodes the RAR alpha/PML fusion protein. Experiments to investigate the biological activity of the abnormal translocation products are in progress. Preliminary results suggest that the PML/RAR alpha fusion protein is responsible for two important properties of the APL phenotype: the differentiation block characteristic of the leukemic blasts and the high sensitivity of the blasts to the differentiative action of retinoic acid (RA) both in vivo and in vitro. The mechanism through which PML/RAR alpha exerts its biological function remains unknown. However, there is accumulating evidence that it acts by interfering with normal endogenous pathways of both RAR alpha and PML. The RAR alpha receptor is implicated in regulating the myeloid differentiation induced by RA. Although the physiological function of PML is not known, it is probably a transcription factor. Definition of the molecular architecture of the t(15;17) has furnished further tools for: (1) molecular diagnosis of APL and (2) highly sensitive evaluation of the neoplastic clone during antileukaemic therapy. The molecular identification of residual APL disease after anti-leukaemia therapy allows patients at risk of relapse to be identified.","['Grignani, F', 'Fagioli, M', 'Ferrucci, P F', 'Alcalay, M', 'Pelicci, P G']","['Grignani F', 'Fagioli M', 'Ferrucci PF', 'Alcalay M', 'Pelicci PG']","['Istituto Clinica Medica I, Policlinico Monteluce, Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(05)80018-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80018-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1993 Jun;7(2):87-93. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(05)80018-9.,,,"['PML', 'RAR&agr;']",,,51,,,,

Further studies with different deletion mutant CREB proteins suggest that although CREB alpha can interact with factors involved in BLV trans activation, it does not promote transcription initiation; consequently some other member/s of the CREB/ATF family must be involved.","['Kiss-Toth, E', 'Paca-uccaralertkun, S', 'Unk, I', 'Boros, I']","['Kiss-Toth E', 'Paca-uccaralertkun S', 'Unk I', 'Boros I']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Szeged.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Protein Binding', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1993/08/11 00:00,1993/08/11 00:01,['1993/08/11 00:00'],"['1993/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.16.3677 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Aug 11;21(16):3677-82. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.16.3677.,,,,,,,,,PMC309865,

Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 inhibited the dephosphorylation of [3H] Ins(1,4,5)P3 by the 5-phosphatase present in erythrocyte ghosts. The Ki value for the former compound was slightly lower than that for Ins(1,4,5)P3, while that for the latter compound was higher. In an assay of [3H] Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase catalyzed by rat brain cytosol, Ins(1,4,6)P3 was as potent as Ins(1,4,5)P3 in inhibiting the phosphorylation, whereas Ins(1,3,6)P3 at concentrations up to 30 microM, was without effect. Ins(1,4,6)P3 and Ins(1,3,6)P3 at higher concentrations were effective in inhibiting [3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to purified Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. It would thus appear that the 2- and 3-hydroxyl groups of Ins(1,4,5)P3 are not primarily involved in recognition by metabolic enzymes, while 6-hydroxyl is slightly or severely involved in recognition by the phosphatase or kinase, respectively. On the other hand, although both 3-OH and 6-OH of Ins(1,4,5)P3 are important in binding by the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor to evoke the release of Ca2+, the 6-OH seems to be the more important.","['Hirata, M', 'Watanabe, Y', 'Yoshida, M', 'Koga, T', 'Ozaki, S']","['Hirata M', 'Watanabe Y', 'Yoshida M', 'Koga T', 'Ozaki S']","['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.1.127 (Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.3.56 (Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Calcium Channels', 'Cerebellum/metabolism', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Inositol Polyphosphate 5-Phosphatases', 'Isomerism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Phosphotransferases/*metabolism', '*Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,2000/03/15 09:00,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/15 09:00 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36508-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 15;268(26):19260-6.,,,,,,,,,,

We found out that mild gamma-irradiation caused an almost immediate decrease in the rate of initiation of genomic DNA replication and stimulated DNA repair. This held true for two different cell lines. Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and Friend transformed erythroid cells, although the effect of gamma-radiation on Friend cells was more pronounced. At the same time, the synthesis of mitochondrial DNA was not affected by the irradiation. The effect of topoisomerase-II inhibitors on DNA initiation closely paralleled that of gamma irradiation, but did not stimulate repair. The fact that gamma-radiation and topoisomerase-II inhibitors, two types of agents that differ so profoundly, have practically the same effect on DNA synthesis speaks strongly in favour of the idea that eukaryotic cells have a general mechanism for coping with any disturbances in DNA integrity and chromatin structure. This mechanism is probably similar to the SOS-mechanism of prokaryotic cells and includes, as an early step, a slowdown of the initiation of replicative DNA synthesis.","['Lallev, A', 'Anachkova, B', 'Russev, G']","['Lallev A', 'Anachkova B', 'Russev G']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/pathology', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*biosynthesis', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', '*Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18130.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Aug 15;216(1):177-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18130.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Cytochemical staining for MPO activity is used clinically to distinguish myeloid from lymphoid leukemias. We studied the expression of MPO at the RNA and protein level in 140 continuous human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines using classical cytochemistry, immunofluorescent staining with a specific monoclonal antibody, Northern blot analysis, and a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification assay. Seventy-eight lymphoid leukemia, myeloma, and lymphoma cell lines were negative; only 3 pre-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines were MPO-positive. Two of these MPO-positive pre-B-ALL cell lines showed a trace expression after RT-PCR and Southern blotting corresponding to 4% to 6% of the transcripts found in other positive myeloid cell lines. The third pre-B-ALL cell line was positive in Northern blots and cytochemical/immunofluorescent staining; however, only few cells were weakly positive in the latter assay. Although 15 of 59 cell lines assigned to the myeloid, monocytic, megakaryocytic, or erythroid lineages were MPO-positive in Northern blots, those 15 and 13 additional cell lines showed bands of mRNA after RT-PCR. MPO protein was detected in all 16 Northern-positive cell lines; on the other hand, there were 4 cell lines that were protein-positive, but Northern-negative. Differentiation induced by protein kinase C activators 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and Bryostatin 1 or by all-trans retinoic acid was associated with a decrease in MPO mRNA in all 7 initially positive cell lines studied, even leading to the complete absence of transcripts, but the enzymatic activity of the differentiated cells was only slightly less than that of unstimulated cells. MPO expression could not be induced in 10 initially negative cell lines. The half-life of MPO mRNA was found to be about 6 hours and was not shortened by prior exposure of the cells to the differentiation-inducing agents. These results confirm that MPO expression is mainly associated with myelomonocytic cells, but also underline the notion that MPO cannot be used as an absolutely lineage-specific marker for the distinction of leukemic cells. MPO can be used as an excellent parameter to characterize the various stages of normal and induced differentiation.","['Hu, Z B', 'Ma, W', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Metge, K', 'Gignac, S M', 'Drexler, H G']","['Hu ZB', 'Ma W', 'Uphoff CC', 'Metge K', 'Gignac SM', 'Drexler HG']","['DSM-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Expression', 'Half-Life', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Lymphoma', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78401-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 1;82(5):1599-607.,,,,,,,,,,

The intercalator resistance and etoposide sensitivity of the HL-60/AMSA cells themselves were confirmed, and the stability of this pharmacologic phenotype over many hundreds of cell generations was demonstrated. Prolonging exposure of HL-60/AMSA cells to amsacrine did not alter their sensitivity relative to that of HL-60 cells. Improved methods of immunoblotting allowed clear demonstration that the topoisomerase II within these cells exhibited sensitivity and resistance characteristics that mirrored those of the cells and the isolated enzymes themselves. Additional biochemical characterization of the type II topoisomerases indicated that both enzymes relaxed supercoiled DNA in a distributive fashion and that the ATP concentrations at which optimal catalytic activity of the two enzymes was exhibited were identical. The enzymes differed, however, in their activity optima in buffers of various type and ionic strength. Furthermore, the inability of the HL-60/AMSA enzyme to exhibit enhanced DNA cleavage in the presence of amsacrine could be overcome if the DNA target molecule contained a bend cloned into its polylinker region. By contrast, a bend in a DNA plasmid containing no polylinker was resistant to amsacrine-enhanced cleavage in the presence of HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II, as was a plasmid containing a polylinker with no bend.

HPRS-103 virus itself did not acutely transform cultured bone-marrow cells. These findings suggest that during myeloid leukemogenesis by HPRS-103 virus, recombinant viruses are generated with transduced cellular oncogenes. The transformed cell appeared to be a macrophage precursor cell. Transformed cells in culture lost their proliferative capacity after a few weeks and then tended to resemble more differentiated macrophages. This change could be reversed temporarily by addition of a myelomonocytic growth factor, cMGF, to the culture medium. In oncogenicity tests, a selection of the virus strains induced MML, nephroblastomas, renal adenomas/adenocarcinomas, and other tumors in line 21 meat-type chickens but not in line 0 chickens. This difference may have been related to a propensity for the virus strains to induce persistent tolerant viremic infections in the line 21 chickens following infection at 1 day of age. The oncogenic pattern was not clearly related to the ability of the viruses to transform cultured bone-marrow cells. The generation of acutely transforming viruses during myeloid leukemogenesis may be relevant to the occurrence of MML in the field.","['Payne, L N', 'Gillespie, A M', 'Howes, K']","['Payne LN', 'Gillespie AM', 'Howes K']","['AFRC Institute for Animal Health, Houghton Laboratory, Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Avian Dis,Avian diseases,0370617,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*microbiology/pathology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology/*pathology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chickens/*microbiology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/microbiology/pathology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Avian Dis. 1993 Apr-Jun;37(2):438-50.,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, two different types of STLV-I within Papio hamadryas baboons were found. One of its represents the baboon prototype STLV-I-Su described earlier, present in lymphomatous baboons from the ""high-lymphoma stock"", which shows about 83% homology to HTLV-I and 85% to STLV-I in the env and tax genes. The inter-individual variability within this subtype is very low (about 1% in the tax gene). The second subtype was mainly found in asymptomatic animals from the control colony and showed in the env gene 95% homology to HTLV-I, but only 82% to the prototype baboon sequence. The presence of two subtypes within the Sukhumi baboon population might be interesting in respect to the inoculation experiments with human leukemic blood and to possible interspecies transmissions. The nature of the Herpes Papio-virus was elucidated as EBV-like and the homology to the human EBV was > 90% in the polymerase gene. The homologies between different monkey species were between 92 and 96% and also here two subtypes within the baboons were detected. This is the first direct demonstration by sequencing that the Herpes Papio virus is closely related to EBV. For further studies of this animal model, rabbits were inoculated with cells originated from lymphomatous baboons and macaques. The rabbits developed generalized lymphomas lethal within 1-2 months. EBV-like and STLV-I-like sequences could be detected by PCR and sequencing showed 99-100% identity to the inoculum, indicating in fact the transmission from monkey to rabbit. These animal models seem to be very suitable for the elucidation of the pathogenesis of human HTLV-I associated T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and might be further on used for therapeutical and preventative studies.","['Schatzl, H', 'Tschikobava, M', 'Rose, D', 'Voevodin, A', 'Nitschko, H', 'Sieger, E', 'Busch, U', 'von der Helm, K', 'Lapin, B']","['Schatzl H', 'Tschikobava M', 'Rose D', 'Voevodin A', 'Nitschko H', 'Sieger E', 'Busch U', 'von der Helm K', 'Lapin B']","['Max von Pettenkofer Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chlorocebus aethiops/*microbiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genes, pX/genetics', 'Genes, pol/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/genetics/microbiology', 'Macaca/*microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Papio/*microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rabbits', 'Simian T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*isolation & purification']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S86-92.,,,"['pol', 'tax']",,,,,,,

Recent data provide evidence that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with a significant proportion of cases. Clonal EBV genomes have been detected in affected tissues and EBV has been localised to RS cells. The significance of these findings is reinforced by the detection of the EBV latent gene product LMP-1, which has known transforming potential, within RS cells in EBV-associated cases. The age distribution of EBV-associated cases is non-random. Paediatric cases, particularly those aged < 10 years, are likely to be EBV-associated as are older adult cases. In contrast, a smaller proportion of young adult cases is EBV-associated, and nodular sclerosis HD cases within this age group are positive infrequently. The results of our studies provide support for the hypothesis that HD has multiple aetiologies but do not support the polio model. The epidemiological evidence suggesting that HD may have an infectious aetiology is strongest for the young adult age group. EBV was suggested as a candidate virus however it is in these cases that there is least evidence for involvement of EBV.

We show here that SM1 antibody reacts with a group of fucose-containing neutral glycolipids and gangliosides many of which are cross-reactive with antibodies to H antigens.","['Cualing, H', 'Siegel, R', 'Schwarting, G A', 'Suchy, S F', 'McCluer, R H', 'Bernal, S']","['Cualing H', 'Siegel R', 'Schwarting GA', 'Suchy SF', 'McCluer RH', 'Bernal S']","['Department of Pathology, University of Cincinnati School of Medicine, OH 45267.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hybridoma,Hybridoma,8202424,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', 'EC 3.2.1.51 (alpha-L-Fucosidase)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Cross Reactions', 'Gangliosides/immunology', 'Glycolipids/*biosynthesis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Glycosphingolipids/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/*metabolism', 'alpha-L-Fucosidase/metabolism']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hyb.1993.12.239 [doi]'],ppublish,Hybridoma. 1993 Jun;12(3):239-47. doi: 10.1089/hyb.1993.12.239.,"['HD-05515/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'NCI PO1-CA38493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We have comparatively studied the expression of the vimentin and the A/C lamin genes at the RNA and protein levels in human U-937 promonocytic and HL-60 promyelocytic cells treated with differentiation inducers. 12-O-Tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate and cytosine arabinoside produced a coordinate and stable stimulation of both vimentin and A/C lamin expression in U-937 cells. A stable increase in vimentin expression was also produced by sodium butyrate and by dibutyryl cyclic AMP in U-937 cells and by dimethyl sulfoxide in HL-60 cells. In contrast, these agents produced only a transient increase in A/C lamin expression (maximum mRNA levels at 6-24 h), which later returned to expression levels similar to or even lower than those in untreated cells. Retinoic acid greatly inhibited vimentin expression in HL-60 cells, but it had little effect on A/C lamin expression. Taken together, the present results suggest that there are important differences in the mechanisms which regulate the expression of the vimentin and nuclear lamin genes, as well as in their implication in the differentiation of human myeloid cells.","['Rius, C', 'Vilaboa, N', 'Mata, F', 'Aller, P']","['Rius C', 'Vilaboa N', 'Mata F', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, CSIC, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vimentin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/genetics/*metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-4827(83)71228-0 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1228 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Sep;208(1):115-20. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1228.,,,,,,,,,,

AML1 is the human homolog of the recently cloned mouse gene pebp2 alpha B, homologous to the DNA binding alpha subunit of the polyoma enhancer factor pebp2. AML1 is also involved in a translocation with chromosome 3 that is seen in patients with therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome and in chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis. We have isolated a fusion cDNA clone from a t(3;21) library derived from a patient with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome; this clone contains sequences from AML1 and from EAP, which we have now localized to band 3q26. EAP has previously been characterized as a highly expressed small nuclear protein of 128 residues (EBER 1) associated with Epstein-Barr virus small RNA.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: One thousand twenty-five patients with a median follow-up duration of 61 months (range, 12 to 240) were included in the analysis. Follow-up was complete in 1,018 patients (99%). Histology was seminoma in 324 patients (38.7%) and nonseminomatous germ cell tumor in 624 patients (61.3%). At the time of median follow-up, 814 patients (79.9%) were alive. RESULTS: Fourteen patients developed a secondary neoplasm (cumulative incidence, 1.38%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 2.30); 13 patients had solid tumors and one had secondary lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(4; 11) translocation including band 11q23. None of 224 patients on surveillance strategy (with or without retroperitoneal lymph node dissection [RPLND]) developed a second neoplasm, compared with four of 413 patients (0.97%; 95% CI, 0 to 1.9) after cisplatin-based chemotherapy (not significant) and nine of 332 patients (2.7%; 95% CI, 0.9 to 4.5) after radiotherapy (P = .02). The cumulative incidence of a secondary neoplasia of 1.76% (95% CI, 0.97 to 2.94) in patients treated by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy was significantly higher compared with patients on surveillance protocols (P = .03). Chemotherapy containing standard-dose etoposide did not increase the risk of occurrence of secondary neoplasms. A significantly elevated relative risk of 7.53 (range, 3.4 to 14.3) compared with the male German population was only found for patients treated by radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Compared with patients who have other curable malignant tumors, an incidence of 1.38 of secondary neoplasms after a median follow-up duration of 61 months is low. The highest risk for secondary neoplasia after treatment of testicular cancer is associated with the use of radiotherapy. Following chemotherapy, no significantly elevated risk was observed. In conclusion, the benefits of curative treatment far outweigh the risk of secondary cancer in patients with malignant germ cell tumors.","['Bokemeyer, C', 'Schmoll, H J']","['Bokemeyer C', 'Schmoll HJ']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hannover University Medical School, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced/*etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Testicular Neoplasms/therapy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1703 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1703-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1703.,,,,,,,,,,

There were more early deaths during the all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induction treatment and more relapses within 2 years of CR in the S-type (6 of 19 cases) than in the L-type group (2 of 33 cases) (P < .025).

Eleven of 62 APL patients in CR, after ATRA-induced CR and chemotherapy consolidation (follow-up, from 3 to 72 months), showed positive RT/PCR. Five of them relapsed within 1 to 6 months after the positive test; one converted to negative after further chemotherapy; and 5 remained in CR status without further PCR data. However, the latter 5 cases all received further intensive consolidation therapy after the PCR positivity.

All previously described primary Ki-1+ lymphomas have been large-cell neoplasms. In this small-cell variant, the diagnosis of lymphoma was difficult to make because there was a predominance of small lymphocytes and, in some cases, clinical features suggested an inflammatory process. Patients were young (age range 0.3-40 years, median 14 years), and frequently had B symptoms (56%); sites of involvement were predominantly skin (78%) and lymph node (67%). The actuarial 2-year disease-free survival was 14%, and the overall survival was 51%. Two patients had a rapidly fatal course. In all cases histologic sections showed a predominance of small lymphocytes with marked nuclear irregularity and often a perivascular/intravascular distribution of CD30+ large cells. All cases had a T-cell phenotype. In four cases the large and small cells could be compared and had a similar aberrant T-cell phenotype. Large cells were CD30+, but only rare small cells expressed CD30. Cytogenetic studies revealed a t(2;5)(p23;q35) in four of four cases studied. Four patients had numerous large cells on repeat biopsies; two of these developed sheets of large CD30+ cells typical of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). These cases provide further evidence that primary Ki-1+ lymphoma has a morphologic spectrum that includes a small-cell variant. Although very different morphologically from previously described Ki-1+ ALCL, this small-cell variant is clearly part of the disease spectrum on the basis of clinical features, the presence of the t(2;5)(p23;q35), the aberrant T-cell phenotype in the small and large cells, as well as histologic progression seen in several patients.","['Kinney, M C', 'Collins, R D', 'Greer, J P', 'Whitlock, J A', 'Sioutos, N', 'Kadin, M E']","['Kinney MC', 'Collins RD', 'Greer JP', 'Whitlock JA', 'Sioutos N', 'Kadin ME']","['Department of Pathology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee 37232-5310.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Ki-1 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199309000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1993 Sep;17(9):859-68. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199309000-00001.,['T32 DK07186/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In the 26 cases, leukemic blast cells from four B-lineage and two T-lineage ALL patients were simultaneously expressing myeloid-associated antigens. By Northern blot analysis, MPO mRNA was detected in leukemic cells from five out of six cases expressing both lymphoid and myeloid antigens, and from four out of 16 B-lineage and one out of four T-lineage ALL without myeloid antigens. There was no detectable MPO protein or enzymatic activity in the leukemic cells of these cases as examined by immunocytochemistry and cytochemistry. MPO mRNA expression in ALL cells was significantly associated with age < 1 year: leukemic blast cells from all five infant ALL patients expressed MPO mRNA, compared to five out of 21 ALL patients > 1 year of age whose leukemic cells were MPO mRNA(+) (p < 0.01). These results suggest that MPO gene transcription in the absence of translation may characterize a recently described subset of pediatric ALL patients who also express myeloid markers, and may serve as a useful marker for this entity.","['Zhou, M', 'Findley, H W', 'Zaki, S R', 'Little, F', 'Coffield, L M', 'Ragab, A H']","['Zhou M', 'Findley HW', 'Zaki SR', 'Little F', 'Coffield LM', 'Ragab AH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Peroxidase/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1180-3.,,,,,,,,,,

All patients in this study had PML/RAR alpha fused mRNA (three cases of the short type and seven cases of the long type), although the chromosomal translocation t(15;17) was not detected in one patient. After ethidium bromide staining, two-thirds of the short type and all cases of the long type were found to have multiple PCR products (192 and 93 base pair (bp) bands in the short type and 666, 522, 263, and 164 bp in the long type). A total of six distinct fused mRNAs were sequenced (P1R1, P1R2, P3R1, P2R1, and P2R2). Southern hybridization analysis showed only one rearranged band in each of the patients. These results suggest that the longest mRNAs in each type are the authentic fused mRNAs and the other smaller mRNAs are generated through splicing events. In RAR alpha, a novel fusion point (R2) was identified within the fourth exon. This uncommon splicing may be caused by the instability of the splicing mechanism of the rearranged PML/RAR alpha gene. Among the ten APL patients, no correlation was observed between the type of fused mRNA and the clinical characteristics examined.","['Matsuoka, A', 'Miyamura, K', 'Emi, N', 'Tahara, T', 'Tanimoto, M', 'Naoe, T', 'Ohno, R', 'Kakizuka, A', 'Evans, R M', 'Saito, H']","['Matsuoka A', 'Miyamura K', 'Emi N', 'Tahara T', 'Tanimoto M', 'Naoe T', 'Ohno R', 'Kakizuka A', 'Evans RM', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1151-5.,,,,,,,,,,

The tight linkage of these RF/J strain proviral loci has prevented genetic segregation of the retroviral genomes. Hence, it is not known whether both of these proviruses are capable of giving rise to new proviral insertions. We have molecularly cloned Emv-16 and Emv-17 and have characterized them in vitro and in vivo. Restriction enzyme analysis of the recombinant clones revealed that the proviral genomes are very similar to each other and closely resemble the wild-type AKR virus. A comparison of the flanking cellular DNA suggests that the Emv-16 and Emv-17 loci did not arise by simple duplication of a viral insertion site within the RF/J genome but most likely are independent integration events. Both proviruses produce infectious virus when transfected into NIH 3T3 cells, indicating that they are nondefective retroviruses. Exogenous infection of SWR/J mice with either Emv-16 or Emv-17 leads to viremia in the host animals, and in both cases, progeny of viremic females acquire new proviral insertions.

LDV induces neurological disorders in old C58 or AKR strains, in which the involvement of multiple copies of the endogenous N-tropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) genome and the Fv-1 locus of the mouse has been implicated. Our previous studies have demonstrated that LDV could infect and replicate in cell lines of the mouse or other species in vitro when they were infected with MuLV. The significance of and the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon, however, remain unclear. We demonstrated in this study the efficient infection and replication of the virus in vitro by inoculation of its RNA mixed with liposome. No significant difference either in the efficiency of RNA transfection or in the ability to support its replication was observed among the various species' cell lines examined. In addition, by RNA transfection the virus replicated with equal efficiency in MuLV-infected and -uninfected cells or in macrophages derived from mice irrespective of their age. In contrast, the pattern of the infection by virus particles was quite different; LDV replication was observed only in macrophages (particularly from newborn mice) and MuLV-infected cells. By using various LDV isolates, it was demonstrated that the capability of replication between neurovirulent, LDV type C, and the other avirulent strains was almost the same in mouse cell lines when their RNA was introduced into the cells. Higher infectivity of LDV-C to MuLV-infected cells may be due to its efficient incorporation of the particles into MuLV-infected cells.","['Inada, T', 'Kikuchi, H', 'Yamazaki, S']","['Inada T', 'Kikuchi H', 'Yamazaki S']","['Central Virus Diagnostic Laboratory, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'RNA, Viral/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection', 'Virion/genetics/*physiology', '*Virus Replication']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5698-5703.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5698-703. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5698-5703.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC237979,

Chronic infection of PLB-985 cells led to increased monocyte-specific surface marker expression, increased c-fms gene transcription, and morphological alterations consistent with differentiation along the monocytic pathway. PLB-IIIB cells displayed a constitutive NF-kappa B-like binding activity that was distinct from that induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment of the parental PLB-985 cell line. This unique DNA binding activity consisted of proteins of 70, 90, and 100 kDa with a high degree of binding specificity for the NF-kappa B site within the PRDII domain of beta interferon. In this report, we characterize the nature of these proteins and demonstrate that binding of these proteins is also induced following Sendai paramyxovirus infection. The 70-kDa protein corresponds to the NF-kappa B RelA (p65) subunit, which is activated in response to an acute paramyxovirus infection or a chronic HIV-1 infection. Virus infection does not appear to alter the amount of RelA (p65) or NFKB1 (p50) but rather affects the capacity of I kappa B alpha to sequester RelA (p65), therefore leading to constitutive levels of RelA DNA binding activity and to increased levels of NF-kappa B-dependent gene activity. The virally induced 90- to 100-kDa proteins have a distinct binding specificity for the PRDII domain and an AT-rich sequence but do not cross-react with NF-kappa B subunit-specific antisera directed against NFKB1 (p105 or p50), NFKB2 (p100 or p52), RelA (p65), or c-rel. DNA binding of the 90- to 100-kDa proteins was not inhibited by recombinant I kappa B alpha/MAD-3 and was resistant to tryptic digestion, suggesting that these proteins may not be NF-kappa B related. Transient cotransfection experiments demonstrated that RelA and NFKB1 expression maximally stimulated HIV-1 LTR- and NF-kappa B-dependent reporter genes; differences in NF-kappa B-like binding activity were also reflected in higher constitutive levels of NF-kappa B-regulated gene expression in HIV-1-infected myeloid cells.","['Roulston, A', 'Beauparlant, P', 'Rice, N', 'Hiscott, J']","['Roulston A', 'Beauparlant P', 'Rice N', 'Hiscott J']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

Superinfection has been observed during T-cell killing and fatal immunodeficiency disease induction by the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) chimera FeLV-FAIDS-EECC, containing the surface envelope glycoprotein (SU) of FeLV-FAIDS clone 61C. We demonstrate here that 61C SU has a defect that results in a nearly complete failure to establish superinfection interference against homologous virus challenge. This failure was evident only in feline T (FeT) cell clones expressing envelope protein, not in the rare cells that have survived cytopathic infection to become chronically infected. The regions of SU responsible for this defect were the same as those previously identified as responsible for T-cell killing. The superinfection interference properties of a noncytophatic molecular clone, FeLV-FAIDS-61E, were different in that 61E established interference to homologous virus challenge, both in SU-expressing cell clones and in chronically infected cells. Neither 61E nor EECC established interference against heterologous virus challenge. Viruses expressing chimeric SU proteins displayed varied and intermediate interference properties. Purified 61E and 61C SU competed for binding sites on FeT cell surfaces, and purified 61E SU blocked infection of virus bearing 61E or 61C SU. In addition, purified 61E and 61C SU each coprecipitated 70-kDa FeT cell surface proteins. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that there are multiple cellular components necessary for 61E and 61C attachment to and penetration of FeT cells, a primary receptor that is utilized by both 61E and 61C, and secondary receptors that are likely to be virus specific.","['Reinhart, T A', 'Ghosh, A K', 'Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I']","['Reinhart TA', 'Ghosh AK', 'Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Cats', 'Chimera', 'Clone Cells', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cricetinae', 'Genes, env', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5153-5162.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5153-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5153-5162.1993.,"['CA43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57402/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['env', 'gag', 'pol']",,,,,,PMC237913,

We tested whether this phenomenon, known as interference to superinfection, might confer protection against retroviral diseases. Newborn mice first inoculated with the attenuated strain B3 of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) were protected against severe early hemolytic anemia and nonacute anemiant erythroleukemia induced by the virulent strain 57 of F-MuLV. Vaccinated animals were also protected as adults against acute polycythemic erythroleukemia induced upon inoculation with the viral complex containing the defective spleen focus-forming virus and F-MuLV 57 as helper virus. Animals were inoculated as newborns, which is known to induce immune tolerance in mice, and the rapid kinetics of protection, incompatible with the delay necessary for the immune response to develop, indicated that protection was not due to an immune mechanism but rather was due to the rapid and long-lasting phenomenon of interference. This result was confirmed by combining parental and envelope chimeric MuLV from different interference groups as vaccinal and challenge viruses. Although efficient protection could be provided by vaccination by interference, we observed that attenuated replication-competent retroviruses from heterologous interference groups might exert deleterious synergistic effects.","['Corbin, A', 'Sitbon, M']","['Corbin A', 'Sitbon M']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Unite INSERM 363, Institut Cochin de Genetique Moleculaire, Universite Paris V, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Vaccines, Attenuated)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Aging/immunology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Vaccines, Attenuated/*therapeutic use', 'Viral Vaccines/*therapeutic use']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5146-5152.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5146-52. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5146-5152.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC237912,

Suppression of c-myc mRNA by dexamethasone closely correlates with cell lysis only in CEM clones with both glucocorticoid receptor and intact lysis functions. We tested the theory that c-myc repression is essential for glucocorticoid-induced lymphocytolysis by preventing down-regulation of c-myc gene in the presence of dexamethasone and by reducing c-myc mRNA levels with antisense oligonucleotides. We find that sustained expression of c-myc provides resistance to dexamethasone-induced lysis, and antisense c-myc oligomers induce cell lysis.

The NADase specifically induced by retinoic acid appeared to be encoded by human leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38 as follows. 1) There was an early expression of CD38 mRNA, together with the induction of the NADase activity, in the retinoic acid-treated HL-60 cells. 2) The time course of the expression of CD38 antigen on the cell surface was well correlated with that of the induction of NADase activity. 3) The NADase activity solubilized from the differentiated HL-60 cell membrane could be immunoprecipitated with an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. 4) Introduction of the CD38 cDNA into Escherichia coli cells resulted in the expression of an NADase, the activity of which was inhibited by dithiothreitol. The NADase activity in the differentiated cells was also inhibited by the reducing reagent. These results clearly indicated that the dithiothreitol-sensitive NADase activity induced by retinoic acid in HL-60 cells is attributed to the molecule of human leukocyte cell surface antigen CD38, which contains cysteine-rich cytoplasmic domain within its molecule.","['Kontani, K', 'Nishina, H', 'Ohoka, Y', 'Takahashi, K', 'Katada, T']","['Kontani K', 'Nishina H', 'Ohoka Y', 'Takahashi K', 'Katada T']","['Department of Life Science, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (NAD+ Nucleosidase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NAD+ Nucleosidase/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85279-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 15;268(23):16895-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Cyclic AMP was shown to play a role in the effect of dbcAMP. Both the treatment with phosphatidyl-inositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and the restriction enzyme digestion of Fc gamma RIII cDNA showed that the Fc gamma RIII on EoL-1 cells was a phosphatidylinositol-linked form.

It is not known whether the prognostic differences apply to clinically staged nonsurgical cases. The authors wanted to determine whether radiologic Stage III substages, determined by computerized axial tomography (CT) scans, are prognostically important in these patients with NSCLC: In addition, they wanted to determine whether the observed superior survival of selected patients with Stage III NSCLC receiving chemotherapy in addition to radiation therapy (chemo-RT) (Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 8433: N Engl J Med 1990; 323:940-5) was influenced by an imbalance in the radiologic Stage III substage. METHODS: Review of pretreatment chest radiographs and CT scans with determination of TNM status and stage was done by the consensus of three readers, who were unaware of which treatment each patient had received (radiation therapy alone [RT] or chemo-RT). RESULTS: Patient characteristics in the two treatment arms were similar. Fifty-five percent of patients receiving RT had Stage IIIa and 33% Stage IIIb disease; in the chemo-RT treatment arm, 73% had Stage IIIa and 25% Stage IIIb disease (P = 0.11). Seven patients (12%) who received RT and one in the chemo-RT treatment arm (2%) had Stage I-II disease on CT scan. Patients with Stage IIIa disease had superior survival to those with Stage IIIb disease (median, 16.5 versus 10.5 months, respectively; P = 0.0045). Within each substage, survival was superior in the chemo-RT (versus RT) treatment arm (Stage IIIa, 17.2 versus 10.7 months, respectively; P = 0.16; Stage IIIb, 12.0 versus 6.9 months, respectively; P = 0.089). CONCLUSIONS: The survival advantage for selected patients with Stage III NSCLC treated with chemo-RT in this study did not result from a more favorable pretreatment radiologic Stage III substage. An advantage for induction chemotherapy was seen in patients with Stage IIIa and IIIb disease.

Ara-C dose rates in excess of 0.5 g/m2/h do not produce further ara-CTP formation. In contrast, when given 4 h prior to ara-C at this dose rate, fludarabine, at doses that are free of neurotoxicity in CLL, enhances ara-CTP accumulation. This led us to administer fludarabine and ara-C to 59 patients with AML in relapse or unresponsive to initial therapy. Fludarabine was given at 30 mg/m2 once daily for 5 doses and ara-C at 0.5 g/m2/h for 2-6 h daily for 6 doses. Doses of fludarabine preceded those of ara-C by 4 h. Results with fludarabine and ara-C (FA) were compared with those of patients treated at M.D. Anderson with high-dose ara-C (HDAC) or intermediate-dose ara-C (IDAC). The complete remission rate with FA was 21/59 (36%) and the actuarial median CR duration 39 weeks. FA produced significantly higher remission rates than HDAC or IDAC in patients with initial remissions > 1 yr (14/20 vs 9/23 vs 6/18, p < 0.05). Response rates were similar for all three treatments in patients with initial remissions < 1 yr or with primary refractory disease. The regimen was well tolerated; one patient developed peripheral neuropathy.

Evidence that leukotrienes are not involved in the coupling mechanism.,215-20,"Ligands including phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies trigger the generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers following their binding to cell-surface structures of human T lymphoid cells. Previous evidence has suggested that the generation of leukotrienes may play an intermediary role in coupling the ligation of T lymphoid cell-surface structures to the inositol lipid signalling system in these cells (A.R. Mire-Sluis et al. (1989) FEBS Lett. 258, 84-88). Here we have studied the actions of two novel selective leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors, MK 886 and BW A4C and of two general lipid soluble antioxidants, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) on this pathway. Neither MK 886 nor BW A4C abrogated stimulation of inositol lipid breakdown following PHA or anti CD3 treatment of T lymphocytes. By contrast, this pathway was inhibited by BHT and BHA. These observations, together with our failure to demonstrate the generation of lipoxygenase products following PHA stimulation of T lymphocytes, suggests that an antioxidant-sensitive step other than the generation of leukotrienes plays a critical role in coupling cell-surface receptors to the inositol lipid signalling system in these cells. By contrast none of these inhibitors abrogated ligand-stimulated inositol lipid signalling in Jurkat T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells. These results suggest a heterogeneity in the organization of the signal transduction machinery in lymphoid cells at different stages of differentiation.","['Khan, M A', 'Jeremy, J Y', 'Hallinan, T', 'Tateson, J E', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Wickremasinghe, R G']","['Khan MA', 'Jeremy JY', 'Hallinan T', 'Tateson JE', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Wickremasinghe RG']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.4.11 (Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*drug effects', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Leukotrienes/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide Phospholipase C', 'Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Solubility', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/18 00:00,1993/08/18 00:01,['1993/08/18 00:00'],"['1993/08/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/18 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/18 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(93)90012-E [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(93)90012-e [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Aug 18;1178(2):215-20. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(93)90012-e.,,,,,,,,,,

However, T cell clones and lines from which B6-1710 reactive hybridomas were established failed to proliferate upon stimulation with B6-1710, while B6-1710 cells were capable of presenting bacterial superantigen to stimulate both T cell hybridomas and clones. Proliferative response of T cells to MAIDS virus superantigen could be detected by the addition of the pharmacological agent phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Thus, B6-1710 seems to lack a stimulatory activity necessary for the proliferative response of T cells to the MAIDS viral superantigen. In the analysis of the response of naive splenic T cells to the MAIDS superantigen, T cells recovered from a culture stimulated with B6-1710 cells in the presence of PMA showed no dominant TCR V beta chain usage, while cells recovered from a culture stimulated with B6-1710 alone were dominated by T cells expressing V beta 5, 11, and 12 TCR chains. These results suggest that T cells bearing a majority of TCR V beta chains are capable of responding to B6-1710 superantigen. The avidity of interaction between T cells and viral superantigen may differ significantly among T cells and those T cells exhibiting weak interaction with MAIDS virus superantigen may require additional signals, such as PMA, for an in vitro proliferative response to B6-1710 cells.","['Heise, M', 'Chow, K', 'Kanagawa, O']","['Heise M', 'Chow K', 'Kanagawa O']","['Department of Pathology and Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/immunology', '*Antigens, Viral', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/5.6.583 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1993 Jun;5(6):583-90. doi: 10.1093/intimm/5.6.583.,['AI 30803/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Measurements of 1- and 2-aza-induced, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cross-linking in the cells revealed patterns of resistance and sensitivity that paralleled the results in the cytotoxicity assays. However, measurements of drug-induced topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cross-linking using purified HL-60 and HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II indicated that both agents could stabilize a covalent complex between DNA and the HL-60 enzyme. HL-60/AMSA topoisomerase II resisted stabilization by either agent.

The protein is expressed in basal cells in normal human epithelium, but no data are available on the frequency or clinical importance of its expression in carcinoma. We studied bcl-2 expression in patients with non-small-cell lung carcinoma and correlated this phenomenon with survival. METHODS: Immunochemical analysis with a monoclonal antibody specific for bcl-2 was used to detect the protein in tumor samples from 122 patients undergoing surgery for squamous-cell carcinoma (80 patients) or adenocarcinoma (42 patients). The possibility that bcl-2 expression correlated with survival was investigated with use of the log-rank test, hazard ratios, and their confidence intervals. RESULTS: We detected bcl-2 protein in 25 percent of squamous-cell carcinomas (20 of 80) and 12 percent of adenocarcinomas (5 of 42). In adjacent normal respiratory epithelium, bcl-2 was expressed only in basal cells. Survival at five years was higher among patients with bcl-2-positive tumors, both in the group as a whole (P < 0.1) and in the group with squamous-cell carcinoma (P < 0.02). Patients 60 years of age or older who had bcl-2-positive tumors had the best prognoses, both in the group as a whole (P < 0.02) and in the group with squamous-cell carcinoma (P < 0.01).

The prompt DMSO-induced [Ca2+]i spike in all of the cell types was not prevented by incubating the cells in Ca(2+)-free medium containing 2 mM EGTA or by pretreating them with the Ca(2+)-channel blockers methoxyverapamil (D600; 100 microM), nifedipine (20 microM), or cobalt (5 mM). However, when granulosa cells, 3T3-L1 cells, or MEL cells were pretreated with lanthanum (La3+; 1 mM), which blocks both Ca2+ channels and membrane Ca2+ pumps, there was a sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in response to 1% DMSO. By contrast, pretreating P19 cells with La3+ (1 mM) did not prolong the DMSO-triggered [Ca2+]i transient. In all cases, the DMSO-induced [Ca2+]i surge was unaffected by pretreating the cells with the inhibitors of inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, neomycin (1.5 mM) or U-73, 122 (2.5 microM). These results suggest that DMSO almost instantaneously triggers the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores through a common mechanism in cells in primary cultures and in cells of a variety of established lines, but this release is not mediated through phosphoinositide breakdown. This large, DMSO-induced Ca2+ spike may play a role in the induction of cell differentiation by DMSO.","['Morley, P', 'Whitfield, J F']","['Morley P', 'Whitfield JF']","['Cell Signals Group, Institute for Biological Sciences, National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '39WPC8JHR8 (Gallopamil)', '3G0H8C9362 (Cobalt)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/analysis/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Cobalt/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2', 'Gallopamil/pharmacology', 'Granulosa Cells/chemistry/cytology/*metabolism', 'Lanthanum/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', 'Nifedipine/pharmacology', 'Teratoma/chemistry/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041560202 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1993 Aug;156(2):219-25. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041560202.,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to test whether 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) and its noncalcemic analogue, 22-oxa-1,25-(OH)2D3 (OCT), could suppress cell proliferation and PTHRP gene expression in an HTLV-I-infected T cell line, MT-2. OCT as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3 inhibited the proliferation of MT-2 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis revealed that OCT, like the parent compound, caused a transition delay of cells through the G1 phase. OCT and 1,25-(OH)2D3 decreased the steady state levels of PTHRP mRNA, and nuclear runoff assays demonstrated that the effect of OCT occurred at a transcription level. As a result, OCT caused a reduction in PTHRP concentrations in the conditioned medium by approximately 50%. OCT inhibited not only the basal secretion but also the stimulation of PTHRP secretion by interleukin-2 or cAMP, which we had identified as two important stimulators. Northern blot analysis and the specific uptake of [3H]1,25-(OH)2D3 revealed unexpectedly that the vitamin D receptor was abundantly expressed in MT-2 cells. These results suggest that OCT, as well as 1,25-(OH)2D3, has the potential to suppress both cell proliferation and PTHRP gene expression through binding to the vitamin D receptor overexpressed in HTLV-I-infected T cells.","['Inoue, D', 'Matsumoto, T', 'Ogata, E', 'Ikeda, K']","['Inoue D', 'Matsumoto T', 'Ogata E', 'Ikeda K']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'N2UJM5NBF6 (maxacalcitol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Virus Replication']",1993/08/05 00:00,1993/08/05 00:01,['1993/08/05 00:00'],"['1993/08/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)85478-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 5;268(22):16730-6.,,,['PTHRP'],,,,,,,

Expression of the ecotropic, but not polytropic, envelope surface protein, gp70, interfered with N-linked glycosylation of the permissive mouse, but not the nonpermissive, human transporter. Incomplete glycosylation may be a direct consequence of gp70 binding since the glycosylated residues, Asn223 and Asn229, are present in the envelope binding domain. Receptors bearing amino acid substitutions in Asn223 and/or Asn229 that prevent glycosylation function normally in virus infection and amino acid transport. However, gp70 expression sufficient to block binding of 125I-gp70 to the receptor in the plasma membrane decreased receptor-mediated arginine uptake by 50%.

Our study focuses on the regulation of interleukin (IL)-6 production in vitro in brain-specific endothelial cells (BEC) under physiological conditions and in a model of human T leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) infection. IL-6 production was strongly up-regulated in a dose-dependent mode upon exposure to recombinant IL-1 beta, although nearly not detectable in unstimulated BEC. This induction of IL-6 production could be achieved by reagents known to increase intracellular levels of cAMP, such as forskolin, prostaglandin E or pentoxifylline. Furthermore, transcription and production of IL-6 was inducible by addition of dibutyryl cAMP, but not by addition of calcium ionophores or diacylglycerol. To assess a potential role of HTLV-1-infected BEC in the pathogenesis of tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP), the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed in BEC. Tax gene-expressing BEC produced constitutively very high amounts of IL-6, which were not longer hyperinducible by IL-1 beta or cAMP derivatives. Our results indicate that HTLV-1 tax induces hyperproduction of IL-6 in brain-specific endothelial cells directly by an intracellular mechanism which subsequently renders IL-6 production independent of exogenous stimuli or activators of (cAMP-dependent) second messenger levels. On the basis of these findings we suggest that tax-mediated hyperactivation of IL-6 production in BEC contributes to elevated IL-6 levels found in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with TSP and might have a significance in the immune pathogenesis of the disease.","['Rott, O', 'Tontsch, U', 'Fleischer, B', 'Cash, E']","['Rott O', 'Tontsch U', 'Fleischer B', 'Cash E']","['1.

Kinetic studies revealed that RMA-S cells required 2-3 h longer incubation and approximately 10 times higher doses of Sendai virus to reach the same level of killing as the RMA parental line. After transfection of RMA-S cells with the murine TAP1/2 gene, Sendai virus antigen presentation was restored to levels of the RMA wild-type line with regard to time of virus infection and dose of virus needed for sensitizing target cells. The presentation of Sendai virus antigen in RMA-S cells was sensitive to brefeldin A (BFA), suggesting that the presentation was mediated via the endogenous pathway.

We show here that PMLRAR proteins exist in solution as stable homodimers whose formation is mediated by a presumptive coiled coil in the PML moiety. In contrast to RAR alpha, which requires heterodimerization with RXR for efficient DNA binding, PMLRAR homodimers can bind to target sequences in the absence of RXR, and the binding pattern of PMLRAR homodimeric complexes to directly repeated motif (DR) response elements with 1-5 bp spacers is different from that of RAR/RXR heterodimeric complexes. We show that the presence of RXR induces the formation of PMLRAR/RXR heteromeric complexes which bind to DNA via one RAR DNA binding domain (DBD) and one RXR DBD, like 'classical' RAR/RXR heterodimers. PMLRAR interaction with RXR occurs in solution and in transfected cultured Cos cells, and PMLRAR is able to sequester RXR efficiently in the cytoplasm, suggesting that dominant 'inactivation' of RXR may be a possible mechanism of action for PMLRAR. Accordingly, we show that PMLRAR can both prevent the binding of the vitamin D3 receptor (VDR) to a target sequence in vitro and inhibit vitamin D3-dependent activation of a VDR-responsive reporter gene in transfected cells. These results suggest that both the distinct DNA binding properties of PMLRAR homodimers and the sequestration of RXR by PMLRARs may contribute to the molecular mechanisms which underlie the pathogenesis of APL.

Maximal EGFR up-regulation occurs 96 h after the beginning of Ara-C exposure while maximal TrfR up-regulation is detected 24 h later. These effects occur without changes in the affinity of EGFR and TrfR for their ligands. Two classes of EGF-binding sites with a Kd of 0.055 nM and 2.3 nM respectively, and one class of transferrin-binding sites with a Kd of about 4 nM are detected on both untreated and Ara-C-treated KB cells. [3H]Thymidine uptake is clearly stimulated on KB cells by nanomolar concentrations of EGF and transferrin, whereas in Ara-C-treated cells [3H]thymidine uptake is not increased by EGF and transferrin under conditions where maximal EGFR and TrfR up-regulation occurs. The enhanced EGF and transferrin binding is paralleled by a twofold increase of in vitro targeting of Ara-C-treated KB and A549 cells with anti-EGFR 108.1 mAb and anti-TrfR OKT9 mAb.

We have now identified an additional biological activity of HGF; this factor probably has a role in early hematopoiesis. We examined the effects of HGF on the growth of various murine hematopoietic progenitor tumor cell lines and found that HGF stimulated DNA synthesis in the myeloid leukemia cell line, NFS-60. The mitogenic effect of HGF on NFS-60 cells was additive with the effect of interleukin 3 (IL-3). On the other hand, HGF had no apparent effect on other myeloid leukemia cell lines examined, such as DA-3 and FDC-P1 cells. Scatchard analysis of specific binding of [125I]HGF revealed expression of a high-affinity HGF receptor on NFS-60 and DA-3 cells, but not on FDC-P1 cells. Expression of c-met mRNA correlated well with the existence of a high-affinity HGF receptor. Since the myeloid leukemia cell lines used are cells in the early stage of myeloid differentiation, HGF may play a role in early hematopoiesis.","['Mizuno, K', 'Higuchi, O', 'Ihle, J N', 'Nakamura, T']","['Mizuno K', 'Higuchi O', 'Ihle JN', 'Nakamura T']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(83)71801-2 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1993.1801 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1993 Jul 15;194(1):178-86. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1993.1801.,,,,,,,,,,

A safe and cost-effective alternative for long-term venous access.,1791-6,"BACKGROUND: Tunneled central venous catheters (CVCs) and infusion ports have often been considered as the only safe alternative for long-term venous access. The objective of this study was to assess the durability, cost, and infection rate of nontunneled, noncuffed Silastic CVCs. METHODS: We studied a representative cohort of 340 consecutive cancer patients with 359 nontunneled Silastic CVCs inserted and followed up at our center. All patients were evaluated clinically and microbiologically at the time of CVC removal. RESULTS: The mean in-place duration of the catheter for the 359 nontunneled CVCs studied was 109 days (total, 39,147 days of catheter use), and the infection rate was 0.13 per 100 catheter days. When compared with the tunneled Hickman catheter, the insertion cost saving was at least $2322 per CVC. At our institution, the use of nontunneled Silastic catheters with the support of an expert infusion team has resulted in an annual cost saving of at least $7,692,000. Long peripheral CVCs (in the basilic/cephalic vein) had a 26% rate of inflammation at the insertion site compared with only 2.6% for the short subclavian CVCs (P < .01). Most of the exit-site inflammations were sterile, with negative skin and catheter cultures. Neutropenia, bone marrow transplantation, high-dose steroids, and use of vesicant chemotherapeutic agents through the CVC did not predispose the patients to catheter infection. By univariate analysis, acute leukemia was the only risk factor for catheter infection. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low infection rate and long durability of nontunneled silicone CVCs, these catheters could offer a cost-effective and safe alternative to surgically implantable tunneled catheters.","['Raad, I', 'Davis, S', 'Becker, M', 'Hohn, D', 'Houston, D', 'Umphrey, J', 'Bodey, G P']","['Raad I', 'Davis S', 'Becker M', 'Hohn D', 'Houston D', 'Umphrey J', 'Bodey GP']","['Department of Medical Specialties, University of Texas M.

Some of the cell lines displayed prominent allelic heterogeneity: within each of these samples there were numerous different M-bcr/Hpall allelic fragments on Southern analysis. Other cell lines displayed allelic predominance: within each of these samples a limited number of M-bcr/Hpall allelic fragments predominated. Analysis of Immunoglobulin JH rearrangements demonstrated a close correlation between clonal complexity (i.e. the number of rearranged JH fragments) and allelic heterogeneity of M-bcr methylation (i.e. the number of M-bcr/Hpall fragments).

We previously reported that a hybrid polyomavirus-SV40 large T antigen, PyT1-521-SVT336-708, binds to both p53 and pRb but does not transform an established rat cell line (J. J. Manfredi and C. Prives, J. Virol. 64:5250-5259, 1990). Here we show that this hybrid large T antigen is capable of immortalizing primary rat cells. Plasmids that express resistance to G418 sulfate and either SV40 large T antigen or PyT1-521-SVT336-708 were transfected into primary rat embryo fibroblasts, and cell lines were established. The cell lines that expressed PyT1-521-SVT336-708 were not fully transformed but did exhibit altered growth properties. Although these PyT1-521-SVT336-708-expressing lines did not form foci, they did grow in low serum and grew to a high saturation density; these cell lines also formed colonies in soft agar, but their colonies were much smaller than those seen with an SV40 large-T-antigen-expressing line. PyT1-521-SVT336-708 also demonstrated the ability to cooperate with activated Ha-ras to form foci on primary rat embryo fibroblasts. Surprisingly, two types of morphologies in such lines were observed: refractile and spindle shaped. Although there was no correlation between T-antigen level and morphology, all lines that displayed refractile morphology expressed high levels of p21ras. Since the p53 binding activity of PyT1-521-SVT336-708 appears to be intact, these results suggest that there are functions residing in the amino end of SV40 large T antigen which are necessary for full transformation that are missing from the amino end of polyomavirus large T antigen. Conversely, conferring the ability to bind to p53 on an amino-terminal fragment of polyomavirus large T antigen, although not enough to allow full transformation function, does increase its oncogenic activity in saturation density and soft agar growth assays.","['Manfredi, J J', 'Prives, C']","['Manfredi JJ', 'Prives C']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Simian virus 40/*genetics', 'Transfection']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.8.4750-4759.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Aug;67(8):4750-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.8.4750-4759.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC237861,

To analyze the viral component responsible for the myeloid leukemogenesis, we cloned several proviruses from a Graffi MuLV-infected cell line.

Both types of MuLV were nondefective, ecotropic, and NB tropic and induced granulocytic leukemia in BALB/c and NFS mice. Restriction enzyme analysis and molecular hybridization with several MuLV probes on one molecular clone from each group revealed that both groups are closely related to each other but are clearly distinct from all known retroviruses. One component of MuLV, however, induced leukemia with a shorter latency period and harbored a lengthier long terminal repeat. The long terminal repeat of the more leukemogenic component of MuLV had acquired a 60-bp perfect duplication in the U3 region. Analysis of the tumor DNAs with probes for the mouse T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes revealed frequent rearrangements with one or both probes.

The above findings suggest that CD10 antigen, through its enzymatic activity, may have a functional role in the assembly and maintenance of PNS myelin. In addition, it is not known whether CD10, similarly to MAG, may be a target antigen in some PNS immune-mediated disorders.","['Cadoni, A', 'Mancardi, G L', 'Zaccheo, D', 'Nocera, A', 'Barocci, S', 'Bianchini, D', 'Schenone, A', 'Capello, E', 'Zicca, A']","['Cadoni A', 'Mancardi GL', 'Zaccheo D', 'Nocera A', 'Barocci S', 'Bianchini D', 'Schenone A', 'Capello E', 'Zicca A']","['Institute of Human Anatomy, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Neuroimmunol,Journal of neuroimmunology,8109498,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Demyelinating Diseases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neprilysin/immunology/*metabolism', 'Nerve Fibers, Myelinated/*metabolism', 'Peripheral Nerves/*metabolism', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/metabolism']",1993/06/01 00:00,2000/06/01 09:00,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-5728(93)90164-T [pii]', '10.1016/0165-5728(93)90164-t [doi]']",ppublish,J Neuroimmunol. 1993 Jun;45(1-2):61-6. doi: 10.1016/0165-5728(93)90164-t.,,,,,,,,,,

So far, interleukin (IL) 6, transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and IL-1 have been found to control N-glycosylation patterns of APP. Cytokines either increased (type I) or decreased (type II) the ratio of bi-relative to more branched N-glycans on APP. In this study, we describe the effect of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), interferon gamma (INF gamma) and dexamethasone (dex) on production of alpha 1-protease inhibitor (PI) and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and on glycosylation of PI in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. Cytokines and dex were used separately and in various combinations including also IL-6 and TGF beta. Production of the antiproteases was quantitated by immunoelectrophoresis of the proteins accumulated in the culture medium. Glycosylation pattern of PI was assessed by crossed immunoaffinity electrophoresis (CIAE) with Concanavalin A (Con A) as a ligand. The production of ACT and PI was increased by LIF, decreased by INF gamma and unaffected by dex. LIF and INF gamma each like IL-6, decreased PI-Con A reactivity while dex like TGF beta enhanced PI-Con A reactivity. Combination of dex with LIF yielded additive effects while combination of dex with either INF gamma, L-6 or TGF beta acted synergistically on PI-Con A reactivity. Combinations of multiple cytokines and dex produced additive, inhibitory or synergistic effects. The type of glycosylation profile of PI secreted by HepG2 cells depended on the composition and amounts of interacting cytokines and dex.","['Mackiewicz, A', 'Laciak, M', 'Gorny, A', 'Baumann, H']","['Mackiewicz A', 'Laciak M', 'Gorny A', 'Baumann H']","['Department of Cancer Immunology, GreatPoland Cancer Center, Poznan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Cell Biol,European journal of cell biology,7906240,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin)', '0 (alpha 1-Antitrypsin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Glycosylation/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'alpha 1-Antichymotrypsin/biosynthesis', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin/biosynthesis/*metabolism']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Cell Biol. 1993 Apr;60(2):331-6.,['CA 26122/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we observed that (Cu(II) strongly mediates the oxidation of hydroquinone (HQ) producing benzoquinone (BQ) and H2O2 through Cu(II)/Cu(I) redox mechanism. Since copper exists in the nucleus and is closely associated with chromosomes and DNA, in this study we investigated whether this chemical--metal redox system induces strand breaks in phi X-174 RFI plasmid DNA. In the presence of micromolar concentrations of Cu(II) and HQ, both single and double strand breaks were induced, whereas HQ, Cu(II), H2O2 or BQ alone at the employed concentrations elicited no significant damage to DNA. The HQ/Cu(II) system was at least twice as efficient as a H2O2/Cu(II) system at inducing DNA strand breaks. Of Cu(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), Cd(II) and Zn(II), only HQ/Cu(II) induced extensive DNA strand breaks. Among HQ, 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT), catechol and phenol, HQ/Cu(II) and BT/Cu(II) were the two most efficient DNA cleaving systems. The presence of bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS) or catalase prevented the HQ/Cu(II)-induced DNA strand breaks. In addition, the HQ/Cu(II)-induced DNA strand breaks could be completely blocked by reduced glutathione and dithiothreitol, but not by L-cysteine. The interaction of L-cysteine with copper in the absence of HQ induced significant DNA strand breaks with the same pattern of DNA strand breaks as that of HQ/Cu(II) plus L-cysteine. In contrast to the HQ/Cu(II) system, a HQ/myeloperoxidase (MPO)/H2O2 system did not induce any DNA strand breaks, and furthermore, the presence of MPO inhibited the HQ/Cu(II)-induced DNA strand breaks. When DNA pretreated with Cu(II) was exposed to HQ, DNA strand breaks were formed that could be prevented by BCS or catalase, indicating that DNA-bound copper can undergo redox cycling in the presence of HQ, generating H2O2. Similar to the H2O2/Cu(II) system, the HQ/Cu(II)-induced DNA strand breaks could not be efficiently inhibited by hydroxyl radical scavengers but could be protected by singlet oxygen scavengers, indicating that the localized generation of singlet oxygen or a singlet oxygen-like entity, possibly a copper-peroxide complex, rather than free hydroxyl radical probably plays a role in the HQ/Cu(II)-induced DNA strand breaks. The above results suggest that macromolecule-associated copper and reactive oxygen generation may be important factors in the mechanism of HQ-induced DNA damage in target cells.","['Li, Y', 'Trush, M A']","['Li Y', 'Trush MA']","['Department of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Hygiene and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Hydroxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",IM,"['Bacteriophage phi X 174/metabolism', 'Copper/chemistry/metabolism/*toxicity', '*DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/chemistry', 'Hydroquinones/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Hydroxides/chemistry', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxygen/chemistry', '*Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Superoxides/chemistry']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/14.7.1303 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1993 Jul;14(7):1303-11. doi: 10.1093/carcin/14.7.1303.,"['ES03760/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES03819/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES05131/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

At diagnosis, 13 pts had promyelocytic leukemia (PML) retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha)-rearranged acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), 8 Philadelphia positive (Ph'+) break-point cluster region (BCR+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and 3 Ph'+ (BCR+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All pts were analyzed at presentation and after Southern blot suppression of specific rearrangements after various treatments, including conventional chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT), all-trans retinoic acid, and alpha-2b interferon. DNA from BM samples collected at diagnosis and, during remission phases, were subjected to Southern blot analysis with the M27 beta probe to detect X chromosome methylation differences, and with BCR, in CML and ALL cases, or PML/RAR-a probes for gene rearrangements, in APL cases. Twenty-one of the 24 pts had polyclonal methylation patterns at remission, together with disappearance of the specific rearrangement, whereas 3 pts retained the same single unmethylated DXS255 allele detected at diagnosis despite no evidence of gene rearrangement. Concerning these 3 pts, such an apparently clonal pattern was also observed in one case in T lymphocytes and skin-derived DNA; in a second case in BM fibroblasts and T lymphocytes; and, in the third case, in blood mononuclear cells obtained from her healthy female BM donor. All these 3 pts are in unmaintained clinical and cytogenetic remission after more than 20 months off therapy. These data suggest that (1) polyclonal and presumably normal hematopoiesis occurs in APL, CML, and Ph'+ ALL pts once the major burden of leukemic cells carrying a specific rearrangement is suppressed by treatment; and (2) unbalanced X chromosome methylation patterns, or aberrant methylation of X chromosome regions may be observed in some cases, most likely reflecting constitutional features simulating a clonal picture.","['Lo Coco, F', 'Pelicci, P G', ""D'Adamo, F"", 'Diverio, D', 'Alimena, G', 'Montefusco, E', 'Arcese, W', 'Avvisati, G', 'De Felice, L', 'Meloni, G']","['Lo Coco F', 'Pelicci PG', ""D'Adamo F"", 'Diverio D', 'Alimena G', 'Montefusco E', 'Arcese W', 'Avvisati G', 'De Felice L', 'Meloni G', 'et al.']","['Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/therapy', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/therapy', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', '*Remission Induction']",1993/07/15 00:00,1993/07/15 00:01,['1993/07/15 00:00'],"['1993/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)73095-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):606-12.,,['Blood. 1993 Jul 15;82(2):337-42.

The data demonstrated differences in protein kinase activity following exposure of Friend erythroleukemia cells to either DMSO or aphidicolin for 30 min. These changes in enzyme activity varied with the treatment of the cells and the substrate used. Two sets of protein kinases, one responsive to cAMP and the other responsive to cGMP, were activated in control cultures. A different cAMP-responsive enzyme was active only in differentiating cells. Another protein kinase, activated by cGMP, was associated with both DMSO and aphidicolin treatment. All of these protein kinases had a histone substrate preference.

Intracranial hemorrhage often leads to death in this setting. Early efforts to prevent this serious complication have included emergent cranial irradiation, with its associated morbidity when used in the young child. Currently, exchange transfusion and/or leukapheresis are employed to acutely lower the peripheral leukocyte count. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report three infants with acute leukemia and hyperleukocytosis in whom intravenous hydration, alkalinization, and allopurinol therapy alone produced rapid and dramatic decreases in the peripheral leukocyte count. RESULTS: The maximal decrease in leukocyte count averaged 88% within 70 h of starting conservative management. A fall in leukocyte count to < 100 x 10(9)/L was noted at an average of 15 h following hospitalization. No patient developed complications. CONCLUSIONS: When comparing this approach to exchange transfusion and leukapheresis we find it to be both safe and effective. Children with hyperleukocytosis in association with acute lymphocytic leukemia who present without life-threatening complications of an extremely high leukocyte count can be safely and effectively managed with intravenous hydration, alkalinization, and allopurinol therapy.","['Nelson, S C', 'Bruggers, C S', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Friedman, H S']","['Nelson SC', 'Bruggers CS', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Friedman HS']","['Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,"['0 (Bicarbonates)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', '8MDF5V39QO (Sodium Bicarbonate)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)']",IM,"['Allopurinol/*therapeutic use', 'Bicarbonates/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocytosis/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Sodium/therapeutic use', 'Sodium Bicarbonate']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Aug;15(3):351-5.,,,,,,29,,,,

Very little is known about the expression and activities of other retro-elements in normal and malignant mammary epithelium. We have begun investigating the possible involvement of the 3 retrotransposons, intracisternal A particles (IAPs), murine-leukemia-virus-related (MuLVr) elements, and VL30 sequences, in neoplastic progression of the mammary gland in BALB/c mice. The purpose of the present study was to determine which of these elements was active in primary mammary carcinomas induced by chemical, hormonal and viral agents. Each of these cancers had aberrant expression of at least one of the latter retrovirus-like components. IAP and/or MuLVr sequences were over-expressed 3 to 100-fold in most of the tumors as compared with normal mammary tissue, whereas VL30 expression was markedly decreased by 5- to 35-fold in almost all of the neoplasms. Our results thus demonstrate that substantial changes in the expression of one or more of these 3 families of endogenous retrotransposons are triggered during mouse mammary tumorigenesis, regardless of etiology. Direct involvement of IAPs and MuLVr elements in neoplastic progression by transposition and insertional mutagenesis in the genome of several hematopoietic cell types has already been demonstrated. Their elevated expression in many mammary carcinomas suggests that these retrotransposons may also be potential participants in some pathways of mouse mammary carcinogenesis.","['Asch, B B', 'Asch, H L', 'Stoler, D L', 'Anderson, G R']","['Asch BB', 'Asch HL', 'Stoler DL', 'Anderson GR']","['Department of Experimental Pathology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*physiology', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics', 'Mammary Glands, Animal', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1993/07/09 00:00,1993/07/09 00:01,['1993/07/09 00:00'],"['1993/07/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/09 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910540516 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1993 Jul 9;54(5):813-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910540516.,"['CA32937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We used a differential hybridization procedure to screen a cDNA library constructed from FVA cells that were treated with Epo 2U/mL in the absence of serum for 2 hours. Of 20,000 recombinant phages, 47 plaques hybridized preferentially to cDNA probe prepared from Epo-stimulated cells. We found at least three different Epo-responsive genes (ERGs) and one of them corresponds to the mouse virus-like (VL30) element, similar to already reported BVL-1. The induction of VL30, which was evident within 30 minutes after Epo exposure, reached a maximum by 1 hour and remained stable for up to 4 hours. The treatment of FVA cells with cycloheximide (CHX) 10 micrograms/mL, which in itself activates the expression of VL30 caused a superinduction of the Epo signal. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations, either raised by ionomycin or depleted by EGTA, had no effect on the Epo-induced VL30 expression. In addition, protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors such as staurosporine (3 mumol/L) or H7 (20 mumol/L) and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (200 mumol/L), did not inhibit the Epo-induced expression of VL30.

TPA stimulated HGF release from the cells through an activation of C-kinase, but not through a formation of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP), an activator of A-kinase and granulocyte-inducer, also stimulated HGF release. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3, another monocyte/macrophage-inducer, abated either TPA- or dbcAMP-stimulated synthesis and release of HGF in a dose-dependent manner probably via its nuclear receptor as reflected by vitamin D analog study. The effects of these three reagents on the steady-state levels of HGF mRNA of 6.0 kb corresponded with their effects on its protein levels. Furthermore, a close correlation between intracellular and extracellular HGF levels strongly suggested that these reagents affected HGF release mainly on its synthesis step. Recombinant human HGF significantly stimulated the proliferation and alkaline phosphatase activity of mouse osteoblastic cell line, MC3T3-E1. In summary, HL-60 cells secrete HGF, whose synthesis is specifically regulated by various reagents independent of their differentiation-inducing effects. Because HGF shows a direct effect on osteoblast-like cells, it might be involved in the interaction of bone marrow cells with bone cells.","['Inaba, M', 'Koyama, H', 'Hino, M', 'Okuno, S', 'Terada, M', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Nishino, T', 'Morii, H']","['Inaba M', 'Koyama H', 'Hino M', 'Okuno S', 'Terada M', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Nishino T', 'Morii H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Osaka City University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteoblasts/cytology/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Secretory Rate/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81314-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):53-9.,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, the distribution of RAG-1 expression in human neoplastic hematopoietic cells was compared with the phenotypic and genotypic status of differentiation. Thirty-one hematopoietic cell lines (16 B-lineage, 9 T-lineage, 2 Hodgkin's disease, and 4 nonlymphoid cell lines) were investigated for the expression of human RAG-1 using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RAG-1 was not expressed in nonlymphoid, Hodgkin's disease, or mature-stage lymphoid cell lines, but was present in some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)/lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) cell lines. The investigation was extended to 45 cases of fresh ALL/LBL cells. The patterns of RAG-1 expression found in the cell lines and fresh ALL/LBL cells were similar. In B-lineage cells, the product of RAG-1 RT-PCR was detected in CD19+ CD10- CD20- CD5- stage (stage II, Nadler's classification) and was at the highest level in CD19+ CD10+ CD20- CD5- stage (stage III), but was absent or limited in CD19+ CD10+ CD20-+ CD5- (stage IV) or CD19+ CD10+ (or CD10-) CD5+. In stage II, monoclonal gene rearrangements of only the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) were found, whereas monoclonal gene rearrangements of both IgH and T-cell receptor (TCR)-beta chain were frequently noted in stages III and IV. The expression of CD20 or CD5 antigen apparently correlated with the decline of RAG-1 expression. In T-lineage cells, RAG-1 was highly expressed in CD3- CD4+ CD8+/CD3+ CD4+ CD8+ thymic stages, but was negative or only weakly expressed in the CD3- CD4- CD8- prothymic or early thymic stage, in which the TCR-beta gene was often germline, or the CD3+ CD4+ CD8- mature thymic stage. The relative levels of RAG-1 mRNA give an additional delineating frame to the schemes of lymphoid differentiation based on phenotypic and genotypic status. RAG-1 is exhibited by cells of the thymic stage capable of synthesizing TCR or expressing it on the cell surface. The weak or absent expression of RAG-1 in the prothymic or early thymic stage suggests that the contribution of RAG-1 to the gene rearrangement may differ quantitatively between TCR-delta/TCR-gamma and TCR-beta.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Yoneda, N', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Kawano, S', 'Matsuo, Y', 'Minowada, J', 'Yamaguchi, N']","['Yoneda N', 'Tatsumi E', 'Kawano S', 'Matsuo Y', 'Minowada J', 'Yamaguchi N']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kobe University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proteins)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Homeodomain Proteins', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81334-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jul 1;82(1):207-16.,,,,,,,,,,

[3H]Leukotriene D4-specific binding to THP-1 cell membranes was of high affinity (KD = 0.47 nM) and saturable, enhanced by divalent cations but inhibited by both monovalent cations and non-hydrolyzable GTP analogs. The cysteinyl leukotrienes competed for [3H]leukotriene D4-specific binding with the following rank order of potency: leukotriene D4 >> leukotriene E4 > leukotriene C4. In addition, leukotriene D4-receptor antagonists from two structural classes, the quinolines MK-571 and L-697,008, and the indole ICI 204,219, displayed nanomolar potency in [3H]leukotriene D4 competition assays. These data show that [3H]leukotriene D4-specific binding to THP-1 cell membranes fulfils the criteria for binding to a leukotriene D4 receptor regulated through interaction with a G protein. Several novel features of the THP-1 leukotriene D4 receptor were investigated. Culture of THP-1 cells in the presence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, resulted in a 6-fold decrease in the number of detectable [3H]leukotriene D4-specific binding sites. Target-size analysis by radiation inactivation estimated a molecular mass of 65 kDa for the [3H]leukotriene D4 specific binding site(s) present in THP-1 cell membranes. Together, these results suggest that the human THP-1 cell leukotriene D4 receptor is a glycosylated protein with a molecular mass of approx. 65 kDa within the membrane environment.","['Rochette, C', 'Nicholson, D W', 'Metters, K M']","['Rochette C', 'Nicholson DW', 'Metters KM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Dorval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukotrienes/pharmacology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Receptors, Leukotriene']",1993/06/30 00:00,1993/06/30 00:01,['1993/06/30 00:00'],"['1993/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(93)90124-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(93)90124-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Jun 30;1177(3):283-90. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(93)90124-8.,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the gene transfer of herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene as a drug-sensitivity gene into human lung cancer cell lines. We used a recombinant retroviral vector derived from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) as one of potential vectors for gene therapy. The amphotropic retroviral vector consisted of the HSV-TK gene and the neomycin-resistant gene under Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoter control. The antiherpes drugs, acyclovir (ACV) and ganciclovir (GCV), were chosen for testing the activity of HSV-TK that was transferred into human lung cancer cell lines. ACV and GCV are nucleoside analogs specifically converted by HSV-TK to a toxic form capable of inhibiting DNA synthesis. The cytotoxicity was determined by using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay (MTT assay). The results obtained from our experiments demonstrated that the retroviral vector-mediated HSV-TK gene transfer leads to ACV- and GCV-dependent cytotoxicity in human lung cancer cell lines, which were both small cell carcinoma and non-small cell carcinoma established from human specimens. These findings suggest that the gene transfer of HSV-TK gene into tumor cells would be one of the models for the use of gene therapy to control lung cancer.","['Hasegawa, Y', 'Emi, N', 'Shimokata, K', 'Abe, A', 'Kawabe, T', 'Hasegawa, T', 'Kirioka, T', 'Saito, H']","['Hasegawa Y', 'Emi N', 'Shimokata K', 'Abe A', 'Kawabe T', 'Hasegawa T', 'Kirioka T', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)'],IM,"['Drug Resistance, Microbial/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Simplexvirus/enzymology/*genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb/8.6.655 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1993 Jun;8(6):655-61. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb/8.6.655.,,,['HSV-TK'],,,,,,,

A comparison of complications in the first 2 years.,207-14,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the short- and medium-term complications (particularly infection) of bone marrow transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia in patients with HLA-identical sibling donors or volunteer unrelated donors. DESIGN: Retrospective review of two cohorts of patients. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: One hundred three patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in first chronic phase. INTERVENTION: Patients were treated with bone marrow transplantation using marrow from HLA-identical siblings (n = 57) and volunteer donors (n = 46). MAIN RESULTS: In total, 68 patients survived a median of 22 months from bone marrow transplant (range, 7 to 81 months). The actuarial probabilities of overall survival and leukemia-free survival at 2 years for the sibling donor group were 73% (95% CI, 60% to 86%) and 72% (CI, 60% to 84%), respectively, and for the volunteer donor group, 47% (CI, 31% to 63%) and 42% (CI, 26% to 58%) (P = 0.07 and 0.05, respectively). However, after adjustment for duration of disease, overall and disease-free survival in the two donor groups did not differ significantly. A major problem was an increased incidence of severe viral infection in the volunteer unrelated donor group (19 episodes in 16 of 46 patients compared with 7 episodes in 7 of 57 sibling donor patients, P = 0.01). The actuarial incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was higher in volunteer unrelated donor patients (77% [CI, 63% to 91%] compared with 49% [CI, 35% to 63%]; P = 0.02) but that of acute GVHD was not. The median performance status of the survivors in the volunteer donor group is similar to that in the sibling donor group. The incidence of hematologic relapse in both groups so far is low. CONCLUSION: Results appear to justify the continued use of volunteer donors in chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia, but infection and chronic GVHD are still major problems.","['Marks, D I', 'Cullis, J O', 'Ward, K N', 'Lacey, S', 'Syzdlo, R', 'Hughes, T P', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Lutz, E', 'Barrett, A J', 'Hows, J M', 'Batchelor, J R', 'Goldman, J M']","['Marks DI', 'Cullis JO', 'Ward KN', 'Lacey S', 'Syzdlo R', 'Hughes TP', 'Schwarer AP', 'Lutz E', 'Barrett AJ', 'Hows JM', 'Batchelor JR', 'Goldman JM']","['Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', '*Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Failure']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.7326/0003-4819-119-3-199308010-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1993 Aug 1;119(3):207-14. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-119-3-199308010-00005.,,,,,,,,,,

Both the original tumor and the cell line failed to express any T-cell differentiation antigens other than very weak cell-surface expression of CD3 and cytoplasmic CD7; with continued growth in vitro, surface CD3 became undetectable in the presence of maintained strong cytoplasmic expression.

However, the mechanism of cytotoxicity of this agent remains unknown. In the present study, we analyzed the kinetics of Topo I-mediated DNA single-strand breaks and internucleosomal DNA cleavage produced by CPT and its derivative, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), in HL-60 cells. DNA single-strand breaks were detected using alkaline sucrose gradient centrifugation when HL-60 cells were incubated with 10 microM CPT or 10 microM SN-38 for 30 min. These DNA single-strand breaks were rapidly repaired after drug removal, while the cytotoxic action of these drugs was sustained. Treatment of HL-60 cells with CPT or SN-38 for 3 h produced extensive degradation of DNA. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed a ladder of DNA fragments consisted of multimers of approximately 200 base pairs, characteristic of apoptosis. Interestingly, this type of DNA fragmentation was also induced within 4 h after repair of DNA single-strand breaks, and subsequently loss of cell viability was observed. When zinc ion, a potent inhibitor of endonuclease, was added to drug-free medium after treatment with CPT or SN-38, internucleosomal DNA cleavage was abolished. Furthermore, addition of zinc ion reduced the loss of cell viability. These data suggest that Topo I-mediated DNA single-strand breaks may be necessary but are not sufficient for cell death, and the endonuclease involved in induction of internucleosomal DNA cleavage may play an important role in HL-60 cell death induced by Topo I inhibitor.","['Yoshida, A', 'Ueda, T', 'Wano, Y', 'Nakamura, T']","['Yoshida A', 'Ueda T', 'Wano Y', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '7673326042 (Irinotecan)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Camptothecin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Irinotecan', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/pharmacology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00177.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 May;84(5):566-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00177.x.,,,,,,,,,PMC5919177,

Purification and characterization of a cytosolic isoform from the murine leukemia cell line L1210.,853-67,"Myristoylation is a co-translational maturation process of proteins. It is extremely specific for the cosubstrate (myristoyl-CoA) and for the substrate protein that should bear a glycine at the N-terminus of the protein to be myristoylated. This acylation is catalyzed by the myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase. Most of the molecular biochemistry and biology concerning this enzyme has been done on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Because of the major importance of this pathway in several types of pathology, it is essential to study intensively the enzyme(s) isolated from mammalian tissue(s) to confirm that the enormous amount of work done on the yeast enzyme can be transposed to mammalian tissues. In earlier studies, we demonstrated the existence of a microsomal N-myristoyltransferase from the murine leukemia cell line L1210 [Boutin, J. A., Clarenc, J.-P., Ferry, G., Ernould, A. P., Remond, G., Vincent, M. & Atassi, G. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 201, 257-263], a feature which is not shared by yeast, and examined the N-myristoyltransferase activities associated with L1210 cytosol. In the present work, we purified to homogeneity one of the isoforms (A) of the transferase from L1210 cytosol. The purified enzyme showed on SDS/PAGE an apparent molecular mass of 67.5 kDa, distinct from the 53-kDa yeast cytosolic enzyme. The purified enzyme from L1210 cytosol could be labeled with [14C]myristoyl-CoA. Rabbit antibodies were raised against the A isoform and used to immunoprecipitate the enzyme and immunoinhibit the activity from the same source. A survey of the specificity of the partially and completely purified isoforms was performed using peptides derived from the NH2-terminus of 42 proteins which are potential substrates for myristoylation, including oncogene products and virus structural proteins. We synthesized a series of compounds capable of inhibiting the cytosol activities of the enzyme. For example, a myristoyltetrahydroquinolein derivative showed an IC50 of about 0.1 microM. Based on both biophysical and biochemical evidence, the N-myristoyltransferases extracted from mammalian cell cytosols seem to be different from the extensively studied yeast enzyme.","['Boutin, J A', 'Ferry, G', 'Ernould, A P', 'Maes, P', 'Remond, G', 'Vincent, M']","['Boutin JA', 'Ferry G', 'Ernould AP', 'Maes P', 'Remond G', 'Vincent M']","['Departement de Cancerologie Experimentale, Institut de Recherches Servier, Suresnes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (VP4 protein, Rotavirus)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.97 (glycylpeptide N-tetradecanoyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Capsid/metabolism', '*Capsid Proteins', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Poliovirus/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Species Specificity']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17989.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Jun 15;214(3):853-67. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17989.x.,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the potential role of FeSFV in enhancement of FIV-mediated disease, persistent FeSFV infection was established in 14 of 24 nine-month-old cats. Four months later, half the FeSFV-infected and half the noninfected cats were inoculated with blood obtained from a cat persistently infected with the Petaluma strain of FIV. At postinoculation week 17, 1 male cat infected with only FIV died of bacterial bronchopneumonia that could have been attributed to FIV-induced acquired immune deficiency-like syndrome.

Athymic nude mice are resistant to ts1-induced neurologic disease. All SCID mice inoculated neonatally with ts1 developed neurologic disorders similar to those of inoculated BALB/c mice, albeit after a longer latency period. In some experiments, instead of inoculating ts1 directly, purified thymocytes, CD4+, or CD8+ T cells from ts1-infected BALB/c mice were transferred to neonatal H-2 compatible SCID mice. We found that SCID mice that received infected thymocytes developed the disease faster than those that received infected CD4+ T cells. SCID mice that received infected CD8+ T cells did not develop any disease. Thus, the (rudimentary) thymus of SCID mouse plays a key role in ts1-induced neurologic disease. In addition, flow cytometric analysis of the reconstituted SCID mice showed that CD8+ T cells migrate and preferentially colonize the thymus while CD4+ T cells were found in the spleen and to a lesser extent in the thymus. However, the significance of this organ specific movements of transferred cells in relation to the virus infection remains unclear. In view of the involvement of the thymus and the CD4+ T cells in human immunodeficiency virus infection, which also infects the central nervous system (CNS) in most cases, our findings in this murine model may help us better understand how the thymus may contribute to the damage of the CNS in retrovirus infections.","['Saha, K', 'Wong, P K']","['Saha K', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Science Park--Research Division, Smithville 78957.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nervous System Diseases/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/*microbiology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/transplantation', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(83)71362-0 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1362 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Jul;195(1):211-8. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1362.,"['AI 28283/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The study of platelet adenosine receptors, however, is limited by the impossibility of maintaining these cells in vitro. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells express megakaryocytic/platelet markers and have been used as a model to study platelet receptors. Therefore, we sought to determine whether adenosine receptors were present in HEL cells. Adenosine agonists produced an accumulation of cAMP in HEL cells, implying the presence of A2 receptors. Xanthine and nonxanthine adenosine receptor antagonists blocked this effect in a simple competitive manner (Schild analysis). Therefore, both platelets and HEL cells possess A2 adenosine receptors. There were, however, significant differences between them. Adenosine agonists were, in general, less potent in HEL cells, compared with platelets. In particular, the adenosine analog CGS 21680, one of the most potent agonists in platelets, was virtually inactive in HEL cells. The orders of potencies for agonists (and their EC50 values for cAMP production) were 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (0.19 microM) = CGS 21680 (0.18 microM) > (R)-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (0.5 microM) in platelets and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (2.4 microM) > (R)-(-)-N6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (160 microM) >> CGS 21680 (1600 microM) in HEL cells. In contrast to the decreased potency of agonists in HEL cells, the antagonist 1,3-dipropyl-8-p-sulfophenylxanthine was more potent in HEL cells, compared with platelets. Based on the striking differences in the rank orders of potencies of agonists and antagonists, we propose that HEL cells and platelets have different subtypes of adenosine A2 receptors. We found CGS 21680 particularly helpful in distinguishing between these receptor subtypes.","['Feoktistov, I', 'Biaggioni, I']","['Feoktistov I', 'Biaggioni I']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology Cardiology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Purinergic Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', ""120225-54-9 (2-(4-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine)"", ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Adenylyl Cyclases/metabolism', 'Blood Platelets/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/blood/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Phenethylamines/pharmacology', 'Purinergic Antagonists', 'Receptors, Purinergic/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Jun;43(6):909-14.,"['HL14192/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00095/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, a mouse fibroblast-derived packaging cell line, psi 2, which releases a replication-defective retrovirus vector bearing the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV)-thymidine kinase (TK) gene, was grown with rat C6 tumor cells in the presence and absence of wild type Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV). Consequently, tumor cells became sensitive to ganciclovir, which is selectively converted to a toxic nucleotide analog by HSV-TK. This killing effect was more effective in the presence than in the absence of wild type retrovirus both in culture and in subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. Tumors regressed in vivo and failed to regrow over a subsequent 10-day observation period after combined treatment with packaging cells, wild type MoMLV, and ganciclovir. This killing effect may be augmented by the ability of the helper retrovirus to package the vector in tumor cells and thus extend delivery of the HSV-TK gene to more tumor cells. This represents significant improvement in tumor therapy in this model system as compared with helper-free systems previously reported by the authors and others. Although additional improvements in the therapy can be envisioned, this approach may prove useful in combination with current modes of therapy for these insidious and lethal tumors.","['Takamiya, Y', 'Short, M P', 'Moolten, F L', 'Fleet, C', 'Mineta, T', 'Breakefield, X O', 'Martuza, R L']","['Takamiya Y', 'Short MP', 'Moolten FL', 'Fleet C', 'Mineta T', 'Breakefield XO', 'Martuza RL']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Ganciclovir/*therapeutic use', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Glioma/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology', 'Retroviridae/*physiology', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/jns.1993.79.1.0104 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 1993 Jul;79(1):104-10. doi: 10.3171/jns.1993.79.1.0104.,"['CIDA KO8012151/CI/NCPDCID CDC HHS/United States', 'NS24279/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This article addresses activity differences between the 6-s-trans (extended) and the 6-s-cis (steroid-like) conformation of 1,25-(OH)2D3 to initiate these responses. Because of facile interconversion of the 6-s-trans and 6-s-cis conformers of 1,25-(OH)2D3, kinetically competent amounts of both conformers exist to interact with any potential receptors for 1,25-(OH)2D3.

These results suggest that the genomic and nongenomic responses are mediated by separate receptors.

The MEV stock carries multiple copies of the ecotropic murine leukemia virus genome. These proviruses are individually detectable in Southern blots, making it possible to follow the segregation of many loci simultaneously in genetic crosses. About 50 novel proviral insertions have been detected in this stock and propagated to homozygosity in a number of sublines. Many of the proviruses were first observed in individuals that were somatic and germinal mosaics. From the minimum frequency of primary transmission of proviruses to offspring, it is estimated that about 7 embryonic cells contribute to the pool of germ cells that populate the gonads. Thirty of the proviruses have been mapped to 15 different chromosomes in intercrosses between MEV sublines and the inbred Mus musculus castaneus strain CAST/Ei or in other crosses. Mapped insertions appear to be randomly distributed among chromosomes, but possibly clustered within chromosomes. Several of the mapped insertions are located such that their inclusion in improved MEV stocks would permit the screening of additional regions of the genome. An improved MEV stock that is homozygous for 12 proviruses on 11 chromosomes, including novel insertions on Chromosomes 17 and 19 is described.

Because dominant-negative RasAsn17 has been shown to block the effects of PMA on pp42 MAP kinase phosphorylation, we assessed its effect on c-Jun phosphorylation by cotransfection with a truncated c-Jun construct (c-Jun234). We found that c-Jun234 was expressed only in the cytosol and was inducibly phosphorylated with kinetics similar to those of endogenous nuclear c-Jun. Furthermore, we found that RasAsn17 had no effect on PMA-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun234. Because Ha-Ras requires isoprenylation for membrane binding, we examined the effect of the isoprenylation inhibitors lovastatin and perillic acid on PMA-induced c-Jun phosphorylation. Pretreatment of U937 cells with these agents had no effect on PMA-induced c-Jun or pp42 MAP kinase phosphorylation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Franklin, C C', 'Unlap, T', 'Adler, V', 'Kraft, A S']","['Franklin CC', 'Unlap T', 'Adler V', 'Kraft AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/*pharmacology', 'Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/*physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 May;4(5):377-85.,['CA42533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We tested the ability of a series of di- and tripeptides to interfere with cell fusion induced by bovine leukemia virus (BLV). Peptides containing a hydrophobic contribution and/or a positive net charge strongly enhanced syncytia formation induced by BLV on CC81 indicator cells. The size of the multinucleated cells was strongly increased (up to 10-fold) in the presence of the enhancer peptides whereas no effect was observed on the indicator cells in the absence of BLV. The peptides thus amplified the fusion process initiated by BLV envelope glycoproteins. The effect was dose-dependent at concentrations ranging from 20 to 640 microM and did not result from an increased expression of BLV proteins. The peptides did not compete with anti-gp51 monoclonal antibodies for the recognition of eight well-defined epitopes of gp51. We consequently hypothesize that the enhancer peptides interact with the membrane of BLV-producing cells and/or indicator cells and propose a model based on molecular modeling.,"['Voneche, V', 'Callebaut, I', 'Lambrecht, B', 'Brasseur, R', 'Burny, A', 'Portetelle, D']","['Voneche V', 'Callebaut I', 'Lambrecht B', 'Brasseur R', 'Burny A', 'Portetelle D']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Fusion/*drug effects', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*pathogenicity', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(83)71034-2 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1034 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Jan;192(1):307-11. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1034.,,,,,,,,,,

Platelets from certain patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia showed decreased expression of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, and platelets from two such patients were studied in some detail. These platelets had very little if any cGMP-dependent protein kinase but a normal level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. They also contained a normal level of VASP (vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein, a specific substrate of both cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase), as well as a functionally intact prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP-mediated VASP phosphorylation. In contrast, sodium nitroprusside-stimulated VASP phosphorylation was severely impaired in these cGMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient platelets, despite an exaggerated cGMP response to sodium nitroprusside. Furthermore, whereas selective activation of the cGMP-dependent protein kinase by 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cGMP strongly inhibited the ADP- or thrombin-evoked calcium mobilization from intracellular stores in normal platelets, this agonist-evoked calcium response was not inhibited by the cGMP analog in cGMP-dependent protein kinase-deficient platelets. The results demonstrate a defect in the nitrovasodilator-/cGMP-regulated signal transduction system in human platelets from some patients with myeloproliferative disorders, and underscore that a cGMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory system, distinct from that of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or other cGMP-dependent effectors is operative in normal human platelets.","['Eigenthaler, M', 'Ullrich, H', 'Geiger, J', 'Horstrup, K', 'Honig-Liedl, P', 'Wiebecke, D', 'Walter, U']","['Eigenthaler M', 'Ullrich H', 'Geiger J', 'Horstrup K', 'Honig-Liedl P', 'Wiebecke D', 'Walter U']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Klinische Forschergruppe, Universitat Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Blood Platelets/*enzymology', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic GMP/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*enzymology', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Phosphoproteins/*blood', 'Protein Kinases/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vasodilation']",1993/06/25 00:00,1993/06/25 00:01,['1993/06/25 00:00'],"['1993/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)38681-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 25;268(18):13526-31.,,,,,,,,,,

Assay of CAT expression dependent on restriction fragments isolated from genomic clones indicated that the fragments located on introns 7 and 9 enhanced the expression. Methylation interference experiments showed that the guanine residues in a consensus sequence of an estrogen response element in the intron 7 fragment interacted with a nuclear factor. Gel retardation analysis indicated that this interaction of the intron 7 fragment with the nuclear factor was specifically inhibited by an oligodeoxynucleotide containing the 21-base pair (bp) estrogen response element. DNase I footprint analysis revealed that a 36-bp-specific sequence of the intron 9 fragment was protected from DNase I by nuclear extracts. This sequence contained a palindromic sequence consisting of the conserved half-motif of an estrogen response element with 5-bp spacing. The interaction of the intron 9 fragment with the nuclear extracts was specifically inhibited by an oligodeoxynucleotide of the 36-bp sequence. Furthermore, the 21- and 36-bp oligodeoxynucleotides in the constructs enhanced CAT expression in the cells.

Neither the original leukemic cells nor the WHN2 cells showed proviral integration in their cellular DNAs by Southern blot analysis. The surface phenotype showed that both the original leukemic cells and the WHN2 cells had a common phenotype of ATL, i.e., positive for CD2, CD4, human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) and CD25, but negative for CD8, a characteristic of helper/inducer T-cells. Most of the chromosomal abnormalities of the original leukemic cells were maintained in the WHN2 cell line. Furthermore, Southern blot analysis of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement revealed that the original leukemic cells and WHN2 cell line had identical patterns, suggesting that the WHN2 cell line was truly derived from the original leukemic cells. Dose-dependent growth on IL-2 was demonstrated, and at the maximal stimulation, the number of cells doubled within three days. This IL-2-dependent growth was inhibited by the simultaneous existence of anti-IL-2 receptor alpha and beta chain antibodies. These results indicate that the character of the WHN2 cell line is similar to that of the cell lines derived from ATL associated with HTLV-I. Thus, the HTLV-I-negative ATL cell line, WHN2, should be useful in the comparative study of the pathogenesis of ATL associated with or without HTLV-I.","['Kagami, Y', 'Tobinai, K', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Nagai, H', 'Hotta, T', 'Seto, M', 'Ueda, R', 'Saito, H']","['Kagami Y', 'Tobinai K', 'Kinoshita T', 'Nagai H', 'Hotta T', 'Seto M', 'Ueda R', 'Saito H']","['Department of Hematology and Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*blood/genetics/microbiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*blood/genetics/microbiology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phenotype', '*Proviruses/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*pathology/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00146.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Apr;84(4):371-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb00146.x.,,,,,,,,,PMC5919300,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 3/87 to 7/90, 41 previously untreated patients at Fox Chase Cancer Center with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, 24 with bulky clinical Stage IIIA, and 17 with IIIB disease, received concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (60 Gy/2.0 Gy/d in 6 weeks) and 2 cycles of infusional 5FU (640-800 mg/m2/24 hrs x 5 d); cisplatin (20 mg/m2 qd x 5); and etoposide (50 mg/m2 d 1, 2, 5) administered days 1 and 28 of TRT. RESULTS: Forty of 41 were evaluable. Response rate was 90%, with radiographic CR in 20%. Thirteen pts (33%) underwent thoracotomy and complete resection with clinical downstaging in 10, including three pathologic CR's. Overall median survival was 14 months and 2-year survival was 38% with no difference between CS IIIA and IIIB pts (p = 0.2224). At median potential follow-up of 42 months, 8/40 pts. (20%) are alive and progression-free, including 4 of 13 resected pts. The chief toxicity was esophagitis, occurring in 32 pts. (80%), Grade 3-4 in 21 (52%), with 13 (33%) requiring hospitalization and 7 (18%) needing TPN. Grade 3-4 granulocytopenia was noted in 20 pts.

Of 13 thoracotomy pts, six underwent lobectomy without perioperative mortality; 3 of 7 pneumonectomy pts died post-operatively, two from broncopleural fistula, and one from ARDS. CONCLUSION: This aggressive regimen produced a 2-year survival (38%) comparable to the best arm of cancer and leukemia groups B study 8433, which administered radical thoracic radiotherapy after protoadjuvant vinblastine and cisplatin in similar and earlier stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. Toxicity, particularly esophagitis, was severe, but of short duration.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: ""Large"" fields (primary tumor and locoregional lymph nodes) received 1.8 Gy followed after 4 to 6 hr by 1.8 Gy two to three times weekly to reduced ""boost"" fields (primary and involved nodes only). The total doses escalated during the study and started with 63 Gy in 5 weeks (45 Gy ""large"" field and 18 Gy ""boost"") for 61 patients. After follow-up for ongoing toxicity assessment, the total dose was increased to 70.2 Gy in 5.5 weeks (50.4 Gy ""large"" field and 19.8 Gy ""boost"") for the next 180 patients. The last 114 patients received 70.2 Gy in 5 weeks (45 Gy ""large"" field and 25.2 Gy ""boost""). RESULTS: Pretreatment patient characteristics were well balanced between the three treatment arms. Grade 3 acute toxicity was 7% for the 63 Gy arm; it was 14% and 17% for the two 70 Gy arms. Grade 4 or greater acute toxicities (esophagitis and pneumonitis) were 2 to 3% for all three arms. Late toxicities ranged between 5 and 9% (> or = Grade 3) and 0 to 2% (> or = Grade 4), not statistically different among the three arms. There was no difference between the three regimens in median survival (9 months) or 1-year survival (39 to 44%). However, the 2-year survivals ranged from 16% (63 Gy) to 21% (""shortened"" 70.2 Gy). Among 176 patients who had the same criteria as Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol 84-33 (American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging, 1984, Stage III; Karnofsky performance status 70 to 100; < 6% weight loss), the 2-year survival rates ranged from 18 to 22%. CONCLUSION: Concomitant boost accelerated fractionation irradiation regimens for non-small cell lung cancer may offer improved long-term survival without enhanced late toxicity. While acute toxicity is somewhat increased, further refinement of the relationship of ""large"" to ""boost"" field doses may improve the therapeutic ratio. Further Phase I/II testing seems justified and necessary, before concomitant boost accelerated fractionation irradiation is tested in Phase III trials for NSCLC.","['Byhardt, R W', 'Pajak, T F', 'Emami, B', 'Herskovic, A', 'Doggett, R S', 'Olsen, L A']","['Byhardt RW', 'Pajak TF', 'Emami B', 'Herskovic A', 'Doggett RS', 'Olsen LA']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/epidemiology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(93)90964-W [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(93)90964-w [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1993 Jun 15;26(3):459-68. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(93)90964-w.,"['CA21661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29565/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Separate structures critical for DNA-cleavage, and for overcoming topoisomerase II-related drug resistance.",2025-35,"In contrast to the classic anthracyclines (doxorubicin and daunorubicin), aclarubicin (ACLA) does not stimulate topoisomerase II (topo II) mediated DNA-cleavage. This distinction may be important with respect to topo II-related drug resistance, and the aim of this study was to clarify drug-structures responsible for this difference. Various ACLA analogs were tested for: (a) interaction with purified topo II, (b) induction of DNA cleavage in cells, (c) cellular uptake and (d) cytotoxicity. A remarkable distinction was seen between analogs containing the chromophore aklavinone (AKV) (e.g. ACLA) which have a carboxymethyl group (COOCH3) at C-10 and drugs with a beta-rhodomycinone (RMN) chromophore with hydroxyl groups at C-10 and at C-11. Thus, RMN-containing analogs, including the aglycone RMN itself, effectively stimulated topo II-mediated DNA cleavage. In contrast, AKV-containing drugs inhibited DNA cleavage and antagonized cytotoxicity mediated by RMN-containing drugs. In OC-NYH/VM cells, exhibiting multidrug resistance due to an altered topo II phenotype (at-MDR), cross-resistance was only seen to the RMN-containing drugs whereas no cross-resistance was seen to the non-DNA cleaving AKV-containing compounds. Thus, our data show that one domain in the anthracycline is of particular importance for the interaction with topo II, namely the positions C-10 and C-11 in the chromophore, and further that at-MDR was circumvented by a COOCH3 substitution at position C-10. These findings may provide guidance for the synthesis and development of new analogs with activity in at-MDR cells.","['Jensen, P B', 'Sorensen, B S', 'Sehested, M', 'Demant, E J', 'Kjeldsen, E', 'Friche, E', 'Hansen, H H']","['Jensen PB', 'Sorensen BS', 'Sehested M', 'Demant EJ', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Friche E', 'Hansen HH']","['Department of Oncology, Finsen Institute, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '105615-58-5 (oxaunomycin)', '16234-96-1 (aklavinone)', '21288-60-8 (rhodomycinone)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anthracyclines', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*physiology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/25 00:00,1993/05/25 00:01,['1993/05/25 00:00'],"['1993/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90013-M [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90013-m [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 May 25;45(10):2025-35. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90013-m.,,,,,,,,,,

Of 41 evaluable patients, 36 (88%) achieved CR within 11 to 91 days with a median of 34 days. Of 3 patients who received preceding chemotherapy due to high leukemia cell counts, 2 achieved CR. Morphological evidence of differentiation was noted in all CR cases, with Auer rods in mature segmented neutrophils in 13 cases. The clinical signs of DIC decreased rapidly within a few days and disappeared in CR cases. Toxicities attributable to ATRA were minimal and included cheilitis, xerosis, dermatitis, gastrointestinal disorders, bone pain, liver damage and high serum triglyceridemia.","['Ohno, R', 'Naoe, T', 'Fukutani, H']","['Ohno R', 'Naoe T', 'Fukutani H']","['Dept. of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Thus, the conversion of a bipartite LIF receptor into a tripartite CNTF receptor apparently occurs by the addition of the specificity-conferring element CNTFR alpha. Both CNTF and LIF trigger the association of initially separate receptor components, which in turn results in tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor subunits. Unlike the IL-6 receptor complex in which homodimerization of gp130 appears to be critical for signal initiation, signaling by the CNTF and LIF receptor complexes depends on the heterodimerization of gp130 with LIFR beta. Ligand-induced dimerization of signal-transducing receptor components, also seen with receptor tyrosine kinases, may provide a general mechanism for the transmission of a signal across the cell membrane.","['Davis, S', 'Aldrich, T H', 'Stahl, N', 'Pan, L', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Ip, N Y', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Davis S', 'Aldrich TH', 'Stahl N', 'Pan L', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Ip NY', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, NY 10591.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, CD', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1993/06/18 00:00,1993/06/18 00:01,['1993/06/18 00:00'],"['1993/06/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/18 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.8390097 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1993 Jun 18;260(5115):1805-8. doi: 10.1126/science.8390097.,,,,,,,,,,

A locus in feline DNA, termed flvi-2, is commonly interrupted in naturally occurring and experimentally induced thymic lymphosarcomas containing LC-FeLV; thus, interruption of a gene encoded by flvi-2 may cooperate with the myc oncogene in the induction of T-cell tumors by LC-FeLV. Clones homologous to flvi-2 have been isolated from a normal human thymus cDNA library.

In feline thymic lymphomas, retroviral integrations occur downstream of the gene, and result in enhanced expression of a bmi-1 transcript of normal size.

In this study, we examined the biochemical and genetic determinants of SU important to virus entry and cell killing. In particular, we developed and used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)/FeLV pseudotype virus interference assays to determine interference subgroupings and assess mechanisms of host cell restriction. We also assessed roles of SU in virus growth kinetics and in the inhibition of cell killing caused by superinfection with cytopathic virus. Subgroup classification by VSV/FeLV pseudotype assay was in agreement with that defined previously by focus interference assay and was found to be determined by changes near the N terminus of SU for FeLV subgroups A (FeLV-A) and C. Virus host range restriction was found to be mediated at the level of virus entry in most cases, although postentry events mediated restriction in the failure of a subgroup A-like, T-cell cytopathic and immunodeficiency-inducing clone (FeLV-FAIDS-EECC) to replicate in feline fibroblasts. FeLV-FAIDS-EECC-induced cell killing was also inhibited by prior infection with one of two FeLV-A isolates. This inhibition could be conveyed by as few as four amino acid changes near the N terminus of the FeLV-A SU and also appeared to be mediated at a postentry level. Lastly, the SU-coding sequence was also found to determine differences in growth kinetics of viruses within the same subgroup. These studies demonstrate that subtle alterations in the FeLV SU, particularly in the N-terminal region, impart multiple significant functional differences which distinguish virus variants.","['Kristal, B S', 'Reinhart, T A', 'Hoover, E A', 'Mullins, J I']","['Kristal BS', 'Reinhart TA', 'Hoover EA', 'Mullins JI']","['Harvard University Division of Medical Sciences, Harvard University School of Public Health, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Surface/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Products, env/*physiology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*growth & development/*pathogenicity', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Species Specificity', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*physiology', 'Viral Interference', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Virus Replication']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.7.4142-4153.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jul;67(7):4142-53. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.7.4142-4153.1993.,"['AI25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC237783,

Three BLV variants cloned from BLV-induced tumors and 12 in vitro-modified proviruses were isolated and analyzed for viral expression in cell culture. The proviruses were then inoculated into sheep in order to assess viral infectivity in vivo. Of three variants cloned from BLV-induced tumors (344, 395, and 1345), one (344) was found infectious in vivo. This particular provirus was used to engineer 12 BLV mutants. A hybrid between the 5' region of the complete but noninfectious provirus 395 and the 3' end of mutant 344 was infectious in vivo, suggesting that the tax/rex sequences were altered in virus 395. As expected, several regions of the BLV genome appeared to be essential for viral infection: the protease, pol, and env genes. Even discrete modifications in the fusion peptide located at the NH2 end of the transmembrane gp30 glycoprotein destroyed the infectious potential. In contrast, mutations and deletions in the X3 region present between the env gene and the 3' tax/rex region did not interfere with viral infection in vivo. This region of unknown function could thus be used to introduce foreign sequences. A BLV recombinant carrying a ribozyme directed against the tax/rex sequences was still infectious in vivo. Cotransfection of two noninfectious mutants carrying deletions led to infection in two of four independent injections, the infectious virus being then a recombinant between the two deletants. The experimental approach described here should help to gain insight into essential mechanisms such as in vivo viral replication, cooperation between deletants for viral infectivity, and viral superinfections. The gene products in the X3 and X4 region which are dispensable for in vivo infection could be involved in leukemogenesis, and thus proviruses deleted in these sequences could constitute the basis for a live attenuated vaccine.","['Willems, L', 'Kettmann, R', 'Dequiedt, F', 'Portetelle, D', 'Voneche, V', 'Cornil, I', 'Kerkhofs, P', 'Burny, A', 'Mammerickx, M']","['Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Dequiedt F', 'Portetelle D', 'Voneche V', 'Cornil I', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Mammerickx M']","['Faculte des Sciences Agronomiques, Gembloux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*growth & development', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sheep/*microbiology', 'Transfection', '*Virus Replication']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.7.4078-4085.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jul;67(7):4078-85. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.7.4078-4085.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC237776,

Increased values of IR50 indicate the suppression of EBV-CTL activity. In 113 human female T-cell leukemia type-I (HTLV-I) non-carriers, the IR50 values (mean +/- S.E.) in non-pregnant, pregnant (the first trimester, second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy) and puerperal women were 10.6 +/- 1.4, 16.1 +/- 1.1 (20.1 +/- 2.0, 14.8 +/- 2.0, 14.6 +/- 1.6), and 12.1 +/- 1.9 respectively.

The method was applied to both PT-18 mast/basophil cells and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells and should be applicable to other cells as well as other metabolizable hydroxy fatty acids or lipids.","['Vonakis, B M', 'Vanderhoek, J Y']","['Vonakis BM', 'Vanderhoek JY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Lipid Res,Journal of lipid research,0376606,"['0 (15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid receptor)', '0 (Cell Extracts)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Eicosanoid)', '0 (Solvents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '9002-93-1 (Octoxynol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cell Fractionation/methods', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Filtration/methods', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*metabolism', 'Octoxynol', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', '*Receptors, Eicosanoid', 'Solvents']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0022-2275(20)39706-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Lipid Res. 1993 May;34(5):853-8.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have, therefore, investigated the effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to membranes of the myeloid cell line HL-60 and assayed in parallel phospholipase C activity and Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation. The assays for Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding, Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation were performed under identical experimental conditions. Ca2+ significantly and reversibly decreased Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding at submicromolar concentrations. Ca2+ stimulated Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation only at concentrations above 1 microM. At 1 microM [Ca2+], Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding was inhibited by 46 +/- 6%, but no Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation was observed. [Mg2+] between 0 and 1 mM slightly stimulated, while higher concentrations inhibited, Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. Mg2+ did not activate phospholipase C. Neither Ca2+ nor Mg2+ induced relevant Ins(1,4,5)P3 degradation under the conditions of the binding assay. The effects of Ca2+ and Mg2+ on Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding were conserved after solubilization of HL-60 membranes. However, only Mg2+, but not Ca2+, inhibited Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the receptor that had been partially purified by heparin affinity chromatography. The Ca2+ sensitivity of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding to the partially purified receptor could be reconstituted by addition of the flow-through of the heparin column. No Ca(2+)-dependent Ins(1,4,5)P3 generation was observed in the reconstituted system. Thus, we conclude that both Ca2+ and Mg2+ can inhibit Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding independently of phospholipase C activation and Ins(1,4,5)P3 breakdown. The Ca2+ effect depends upon factors that can be separated biochemically from the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor. Mg2+ acts either directly on the Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor or on a closely associated target.","['Van Delden, C', 'Foti, M', 'Lew, D P', 'Krause, K H']","['Van Delden C', 'Foti M', 'Lew DP', 'Krause KH']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (ITPR1 protein, human)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*pharmacology', '*Calcium Channels', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Magnesium/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)31409-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 15;268(17):12443-8.,,,,,,,,,,

This event is associated with induction of the c-jun early response gene and appearance of a monocytic phenotype. The present studies have examined the effects of vincristine-selected, multidrug resistance on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced HL-60 cell differentiation. The results demonstrate that multidrug-resistant HL-60 cells, designated HL-60/vinc, fail to respond to TPA with an increase in c-jun transcripts or other phenotypic characteristics of monocytic differentiation. By contrast, treatment of HL-60/vinc cells with okadaic acid, an inhibitor of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, induces c-jun transcription, growth arrest, and expression of the c-fms gene. Studies were also performed with an HL-60/vinc revertant (HL-60/vinc/R) line that has regained partial sensitivity to vincristine. The finding that HL-60/vinc/R cells respond to TPA with induction of a monocytic phenotype, but not c-jun expression, suggests that c-jun induction is not obligatory for monocytic differentiation. Other studies further demonstrate that the jun-B and fra-1 genes are induced by TPA in both HL-60/vinc and HL-60/vinc/R cells, whereas c-fos expression is attenuated in the HL-60/vinc line. Since TPA activates protein kinase C (PKC), we examined translocation of PKC from the cytosol to the membrane fraction. Although HL-60 and HL-60/vinc/R cells demonstrated translocation of PKC activity, this subcellular redistribution was undetectable in HL-60/vinc cells. Activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family with associated phosphorylation of c-Jun Y-peptide was markedly diminished in TPA-treated HL-60/vinc cells, but not in response to okadaic acid. Taken together, these findings suggest that vincristine resistance confers insensitivity to TPA-induced differentiation and can include defects in PKC-mediated signaling events and induction of jun/fos early response gene expression.","['Slapak, C A', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Saleem, A', 'Kufe, D W']","['Slapak CA', 'Kharbanda S', 'Saleem A', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)31384-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jun 15;268(17):12267-73.,"['CA-01613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['c-fms', 'c-fos', 'c-jun', 'fra-1']",,,,,,,

A cancer and leukemia group B study.",62-8,"BACKGROUND: This Phase I study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of ifosfamide-mesna with a fixed dose of cisplatin without growth factor or hematopoietic precursor support. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer were treated at four dose levels. Initially, the cisplatin dose was 100 mg/m2 given on day 1. Seven patients were treated with ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 days 1 to 3, and six patients received ifosfamide 2.5 g/m2 days 1 to 3. Mesna was given at 20% of the ifosfamide dose at 0, 4, and 6 hours after ifosfamide. Cycles were repeated every 4 weeks. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicities (myelosuppression and renal toxicity) were seen at dose level 2 (ifosfamide 2.5 g/m2). Because 5 of the first 13 patients experienced Grade 3 renal toxicity, the study was amended to give cisplatin in divided doses. An additional six patients each were treated at dose level 3 (ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 days 1-3) and dose level 4 (ifosfamide 2.5 g/m2 days 1-3) with cisplatin 33 mg/m2 days 1 to 3. Dose-limiting toxicity (myelosuppression) was reached at ifosfamide 2.5 g/m2. No further Grade 3 renal toxicity was seen. Grade 3 or worse toxicities were seen as follows: neutropenia 80%, thrombocytopenia 48%, nausea/vomiting 36%, anemia 32%, renal 20%, central nervous system 16%, and infection 16%. Two toxic deaths occurred, both with infection, renal failure, and neutropenia. Partial responses were seen in 8 of 25 eligible patients (32%). CONCLUSIONS: The maximum tolerated dose in this group of patients was defined as ifosfamide 2.0 g/m2 days 1 to 3 when given with cisplatin 33 mg/m2 days 1 to 3. When combining high-dose cisplatin with ifosfamide, it is advisable to give cisplatin in divided doses.","['Graziano, S L', 'Herndon, J E 2nd', 'Richards, F 2nd', 'DiFino, S', 'Modeas, C', 'Duggan, D B', 'Green, M R']","['Graziano SL', 'Herndon JE 2nd', 'Richards F 2nd', 'DiFino S', 'Modeas C', 'Duggan DB', 'Green MR']","['Department of Medicine, SUNY-Health Science Center, Syracuse 13210.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['NR7O1405Q9 (Mesna)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Fluid Therapy', 'Humans', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesna/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<62::aid-cncr2820720114>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jul 1;72(1):62-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930701)72:1<62::aid-cncr2820720114>3.0.co;2-e.,"['CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that these leukemic conditions originate from a MGCT progenitor cell capable of undergoing non-germ cell (hematopoietic) differentiation. METHODS: To assess this hypothesis, histologic material from six patients with MGCTs associated with leukemia was examined using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies capable of labeling cells of the different marrow cell lineages. RESULTS: Morphologically identifiable hematologic cells were found within the yolk sac tumor component of the MGCT in four of these patients. In three of the four cases, the cells consisted of poorly differentiated blast cells, whereas in the fourth, clusters of erythroblasts were identified. The leukemic cells within the MGCT and in the bone marrow had similar morphology, constant expression of the early progenitor cell marker CD34, and variable expression of more mature myeloid, monocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic markers. Three cases expressed p53, a nuclear protein associated with neoplastic transformation in a wide range of malignancies, including testicular cancers, but which rarely is reported in leukemias. Karyotype of the leukemia was assessed in five cases: two showed an i(12p), a cytogenetic marker of GCT not identified in the usual cases of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that these leukemic conditions originate in the MGCT through a mechanism of differentiation from a yolk sac tumor-derived progenitor cell, with subsequent homing to the marrow.","['Orazi, A', 'Neiman, R S', 'Ulbright, T M', 'Heerema, N A', 'John, K', 'Nichols, C R']","['Orazi A', 'Neiman RS', 'Ulbright TM', 'Heerema NA', 'John K', 'Nichols CR']","['Department of Pathology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mediastinal Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Mesonephroma/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930615)71:12<3873::aid-cncr2820711214>3.0.co;2-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Jun 15;71(12):3873-81. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930615)71:12<3873::aid-cncr2820711214>3.0.co;2-1.,,,,,,,,,,

All three agents induced a threefold to fivefold increase in the expression of specific [11,12-3H]LXA4 binding. Similar results were obtained in parallel with [14,15-3H]leukotriene (LT) B4. For both 3H-ligands, homologous displacement curves were similar and independent of the agent used to induce differentiation. Specific binding of [11,12-3H]LXA4 to differentiated HL-60 cells gave a kd = 0.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/L. The appearance of both [11,12-3H]LXA4 and [14,15-3H]LTB4-specific binding sites was inhibited by actinomycin D, and LXA4 binding was sensitive to protease treatment. Specific binding of [11,12-3H]LXA4 was not evident with human platelets, red blood cells (RBCs) or the cultured B-cell (Raji), T-cell (Jurkat) lines save human endothelial cells (kd = 11.0 +/- 0.3 nmol/L). The structural specificity of induced [11,12-3H]-LXA4 recognition sites was assessed with LXB4, LTC4, LTB4, and trihydroxyhepatanoic methyl ester. Only LTC4, at 3-log molar excess, competed for 3H-LXA4-specific binding with HL-60 cells and gave a 30% reduction. The leukotriene D4 receptor antagonist SKF 104353 was ineffective in blocking [11,12-3H]LXA4-specific binding with HL-60 cells while it competed for specific [11,12-3H]LXA4 binding with endothelial cells where LTD4 binding appears to be virtually identical to that of LXA4 binding. In addition, the LTB4 receptor antagonist ONO 4057 was ineffective at competing for [11,12-3H]LXA4 binding. When phospholipase D activation was monitored in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and HL-60 cells, a correlation was shown between activation and specific 3H-LXA4 binding. LXA4-induced phospholipase D (PLD) activation gave a biphasic concentration-dependent response comprised of at least two components: one phase being islet-activating protein (IAP)-sensitive (LXA4 10(-9) mol/L peak activity) and the other was staurosporine-sensitive (LXA4 10(-7) mol/L peak activity). Results indicate that HL-60 cells exposed to differentiating agents express [11,12-3H]LXA4 recognition sites also present in PMN. In addition, specific LXA4 recognition sites of myeloid cells can be distinguished by competition binding with SKF 104353 and 3H-LXA4 cross-reactivity with putative LTD4 receptors present on human endothelial cells. Moreover, they provide evidence indicating that binding of LXA4 to its recognition sites confers functional responses.","['Fiore, S', 'Romano, M', 'Reardon, E M', 'Serhan, C N']","['Fiore S', 'Romano M', 'Reardon EM', 'Serhan CN']","[""Hematology-Oncology Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Binding, Competitive', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', '*Lipoxins', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71911-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 15;81(12):3395-403.,['GM 38765/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have shown that the 11q23 gene HRX is fused to heterologous genes from chromosomes 4 or 19 after t(4;11)(q21;q23) and t(11;19)(q23;p13) translocations to create fusion genes encoding proteins with structural features of chimeric transcription factors. In this report, we show structural alterations of HRX by conventional Southern blot analyses in 26 of 27 de novo leukemias with cytogenetically diverse 11q23 abnormalities. The sole case that lacked HRX rearrangements was a t(11;17)-acute myeloid leukemia with French-American-British M3-like morphology. We also analyzed 10 secondary leukemias that arose after therapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors and found HRX rearrangements in 7 of 7 with 11q23 translocations, and in 2 of 2 with unsuccessful karyotypes. In total, we observed HRX rearrangements in 35 leukemias involving at least nine distinct donor loci (1q32, 4q21, 6q27, 7p15, 9p21-24, 15q15, 16p13, and two 19p13 sites). All breakpoints localized to an 8-kb region that encompassed exons 5-11 of HRX, suggesting that fusion proteins containing similar portions of HRX may be consistently created in leukemias with 11q23 abnormalities. We conclude that alteration of HRX is a recurrent pathogenetic event in leukemias with 11q23 aberrations involving many potential partners in a variety of settings including acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and topoisomerase II inhibitor-induced secondary leukemias of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages.","['Hunger, S P', 'Tkachuk, D C', 'Amylon, M D', 'Link, M P', 'Carroll, A J', 'Welborn, J L', 'Willman, C L', 'Cleary, M L']","['Hunger SP', 'Tkachuk DC', 'Amylon MD', 'Link MP', 'Carroll AJ', 'Welborn JL', 'Willman CL', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine 94305-5324.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced/genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemically induced/genetics', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)71884-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jun 15;81(12):3197-203.,"['CA30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['Blood. 1993 Nov 15;82(10):3220-1.

MPO deficiency in monocytes appeared to be associated with impaired phagocytic capacity and, based on the results of immunophenotypic and ultrastructural studies, was most likely attributable to a partial maturation arrest of monocytes.

The consistent finding that RA induces remissions in APL is especially notable, since treatment involves an oral formulation of RA. The clinical responses are linked to leukemic cell maturation, suggesting a noncytotoxic mechanism of RA action. This provides a rationale for combining cytotoxic and cytodifferentiation agents in future clinical trials. Despite high initial CR rates with continuous RA therapy, relapses frequently occur. Pharmacologic mechanisms of resistance to RA therapy are implicated in clinical resistance. Future work will explore if this resistance can be overcome and how genetic mechanisms contribute to clinical RA resistance in APL. The exciting convergence of clinical and basic information in PL has led to new insights into the molecular nature of this leukemia. The discovery that RAR-alpha is rearranged in the t(15,17) provides an opportunity to study how this rearrangement is involved in oncogenesis and treatment response in APL. The application of RT-PCR assays for this molecular rearrangement will be useful in the diagnosis and subsequent tailoring of postremission therapy in APL. Whether APL serves as a paradigm for cytodifferentiation therapy remains to be seen. However, it is encouraging that 13-cis-retinoic acid in combination with alpha interferon is an active therapy in squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix and skin. Although the mechanisms responsible for these clinical responses are unknown, they highlight the need to learn how RA works and when it should be used to treat cancer patients.","['Miller, W H Jr', 'Dmitrovsky, E']","['Miller WH Jr', 'Dmitrovsky E']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Important Adv Oncol,Important advances in oncology,8505229,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*drug effects/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1993/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Important Adv Oncol. 1993:81-90.,,,['RAR-&agr;'],,,76,,,,

Observation with fluorescence microscopy showed that F-actin detached from the plasma membrane at the site of the blebs. Further treatment with tautomycin induced the accumulation of F-actin at the segmentation centers. Under electron microscopy, an electron dense ring-structure was detected at the segmentation center. Tautomycin did not induce major changes of the microtubule network although F-actin accumulated near the microtubule organizing center. The amount of F-actin increased in tautomycin-treated cells.

Five-day proliferation rates of cultured MNCL (CRNK-16) cells in diffusion chambers implanted in DR-treated rats were 22% less than in AL-treated rats (P = 0.03), indicating that DR-dependent diffusible factor(s) modulate in situ MNCL cell growth. Serum from DR-treated rats supported lower in vitro CRNK-16 cell proliferation rates relative to serum from AL-treated rats. Serum levels of both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) were over 50% lower in DR- versus AL-treated rats. An evaluation of the in vitro cell proliferative activity of a panel of purified factors showed that GH and IGF-1, but not 15 other growth factors, stimulated thymidine incorporation in CRNK-16 cells. Infusion of either GH or IGF-1 via osmotic minipumps restored in situ and in vitro CRNK-16 cell proliferation in DR-treated rats up to rates measured in AL-treated rats. Splenocytes from DR-treated rats, relative to AL-treated rats, were more sensitive to mitogen stimulation, displayed increased cell surface expression of receptors for class 1 and 2 major histocompatibility complex molecules, and were more cytotoxic to target tumor cells. Infusion of either GH or IGF-1 in DR-treated rats further enhanced mitogen responsiveness and natural cytotoxicity but reversed the DR-induced increase in major histocompatibility complex receptors. We conclude that DR modulates MNCL progression in Fischer 344 rats through both its influence on MNCL cell proliferation via suppression of the GH:IGF-1 axis and its enhancement of host defenses against tumor cells.","['Hursting, S D', 'Switzer, B R', 'French, J E', 'Kari, F W']","['Hursting SD', 'Switzer BR', 'French JE', 'Kari FW']","['Department of Nutrition, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/blood', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Diet', 'Diffusion Chambers, Culture', 'Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/*blood/pharmacology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/administration & dosage/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344']",1993/06/15 00:00,1993/06/15 00:01,['1993/06/15 00:00'],"['1993/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jun 15;53(12):2750-7.,,,,,,,,,,

MPO was detected in 16/17 AML, but only in 1/6 ALL, the MPO positive ALL being also CD13 positive. MPO was detectable in 3/4 AML with T-lymphoid features; a case of myeloid antigen-positive T-ALL, however, was MPO-negative. cCD3 was expressed only in T-ALL, and five cases of lymphoid antigen-positive AML were cCD3-negative. We suggest that these flow cytometric assays are useful for the lineage assignment of poorly differentiated leukemias and contribute to the identification of truly biphenotypic acute leukemias.","['Drach, D', 'Drach, J', 'Glassl, H', 'Gattringer, C', 'Huber, H']","['Drach D', 'Drach J', 'Glassl H', 'Gattringer C', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CD22 protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD3 Complex/analysis', '*Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cytoplasm/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Lectins', 'Leukemia/*classification/*immunology', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90102-q [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 May;17(5):455-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90102-q.,,,,,,,,,,

This property suggests that lithium chloride may have effects on hematopoietic differentiation. Treatment of cultured WEHI-3B D+ murine myelomonocytic and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells with millimolar concentrations of lithium chloride resulted in concentration-dependent increases in the number of differentiated myeloid cells, as determined by the ability of the cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium and by the binding of myeloid specific antibodies, and was associated with an inhibition of cellular proliferation. The effects of lithium chloride on growth and differentiation were antagonized by KCl, whereas NaCl had little effect. The induction of leukemic cell maturation by lithium chloride was markedly enhanced by the addition of low levels of retinoic acid. In contrast, other differentiation inducing agents (i.e. dimethyl sulfoxide and selenazofurin) had no effect on the degree of maturation induced by lithium. These findings suggest that the combination of lithium chloride and retinoic acid may have clinical utility in the treatment of leukemia through the induction of terminal differentiation.","['Sokoloski, J A', 'Li, J', 'Nigam, A', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Sokoloski JA', 'Li J', 'Nigam A', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9FN79X2M3F (Lithium)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chlorides/*pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lithium/*pharmacology', 'Lithium Chloride', 'Mice', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(93)90095-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 May;17(5):403-10. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90095-3.,"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Leuk Res. 1993 Nov;17(11):1017-8.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four cases of secondary AML with chromosomal abnormalities involving bands 11q23 and 21q22, in the absence of prior treatment with etoposide or teniposide, were identified among patients treated at St Jude Children's Research Hospital between January 1980 and April 1992. RESULTS: The four identified patients were initially treated for rhabdomyosarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2), and Hodgkins' disease. Prior chemotherapy included relatively low cumulative doses of doxorubicin (median, 150 mg/m2; range, 120 to 375 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (median, 3,100 mg/m2; range, 2,250 to 11,400 mg/m2). All four patients had received radiation therapy: 59.4 Gy to the right middle ear for rhabdomyosarcoma; 15 Gy and 12 Gy to the abdomen and right lower quadrant, respectively, for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; 27 Gy to the right orbit for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; and 36.6 Gy to the mantle-paraaortic-spleen regions plus 20.4 Gy inverted-Y radiation at relapse for Hodgkin's disease. Secondary AML was diagnosed a median of 38 months after initial diagnosis (range, 14 to 55). Leukemic cell translocations involved band 11q23 in two cases and band 21q22 in two. Although all patients obtained a complete remission (CR), only one remains disease-free (at 34 months), following an allogeneic bone marrow transplant. CONCLUSION: Intercalating topoisomerase II inhibitors (doxorubicin, dactinomycin), when combined with alkylating agents and irradiation, may cause secondary AML.","['Sandoval, C', 'Pui, C H', 'Bowman, L C', 'Heaton, D', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Behm, F G', 'Head, D R']","['Sandoval C', 'Pui CH', 'Bowman LC', 'Heaton D', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Raimondi SC', 'Behm FG', 'Head DR']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Alkylating Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dactinomycin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Podophyllotoxin/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.6.1039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Jun;11(6):1039-45. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.6.1039.,"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 27165/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We examined the release of thromboxane B2 (TXB2) from undifferentiated and differentiated cells after stimulation with opsonized zymosan and investigated whether the release of this mediator could be modified by isoprenaline. After stimulation, the U937 cells released TXB2 in a dose-dependent manner, with the release greater from the differentiated cells. The TXB2 released was inhibited by flurbiprofen (> 10(-8) M; P < .01) and isoprenaline (> 10(-6) M; P < .01), and the inhibition was reversed by propranolol (10(-6) M; P < .02). Thus, it is clear that undifferentiated and differentiated U937 cells release TXB2, which can be inhibited by beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation. These findings illustrate an important functional difference between the in vivo macrophages and differentiated U937 cells because beta 2-adrenoceptor stimulation does not inhibit mediator release from macrophages.","['Brightling, C E', 'Baker, A J', 'Fuller, R W']","['Brightling CE', 'Baker AJ', 'Fuller RW']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Opsonin Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '54397-85-2 (Thromboxane B2)', '5GRO578KLP (Flurbiprofen)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', '9Y8NXQ24VQ (Propranolol)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flurbiprofen/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoproterenol/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/chemistry/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Opsonin Proteins/metabolism', 'Propranolol/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/analysis/physiology', 'Thromboxane B2/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Zymosan/pharmacology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jlb.53.5.559 [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 1993 May;53(5):559-62. doi: 10.1002/jlb.53.5.559.,,,,,,,,,,

Alkaline phosphatase, a marker for the membrane of secretory vesicles (the most readily mobilizable pool of intracellular membranes in neutrophils) was highly elevated in the PV/MF patients and significantly reduced in the CML patients. In spite of this, the amount of secretory vesicles was normal as judged by the content of albumin, and of the membrane protein cytochrome b-245 and CD11b, both partially localized in secretory vesicles. Gelatinase granules were present in all patients. The azurophil granules were lighter than normal in both CML patients. SDS-PAGE protein profiles indicated absence of defensins from azurophil granules from 1 CML patient. In addition, a 41-42 kD doublet protein band was absent from 2 PV and 1 CML patient, and reduced in the other CML patient. No difference in mobilization of granules was observed between patient neutrophils and control neutrophils. Also, stimulation with 10(-8) mol/l N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine induced normal increases in intracellular Ca2+ in patient neutrophils.

The efficacy of field application of the developed method was verified by evaluating the rate of viral transmission to calves from infected cows, whether they have persistent lymphocytosis. With this objective, 43 calves were simultaneously tested at birth and at 6 months of age for viral antibodies in serum and for proviral DNA in lymphocytes. At birth, 36 calves were BLV-negative and 3 were BLV-positive by results of serologic and DNA-based assays. Conversely, results for 4 calves had lack of correlation between the diagnostic methods. In particular, 2 calves were DNA-positive and antibody-negative for BLV and 2 other calves had the opposite test results. At 6 months of age, when the immunologic pattern more closely reflects the status of calves' immune response, independent of maternal antibodies, all calves DNA-negative for BLV at birth (n = 38), were consistently PCR- and antibody-negative for BLV. On the contrary, the cattle DNA-positive for BLV at birth (n = 5), whether seropositive or not, were PCR- and antibody-positive for BLV, at the time of the second screening. Thus, these results indicate reliability of the PCR to diagnose perinatal BLV infection. Furthermore, the observation that all calves found to be infected at birth were born to BLV-positive cows with persistent lymphocytosis, indicates that the persistent lymphocytosis status of the cow may represent a factor associated with BLV infection in utero.","['Agresti, A', 'Ponti, W', 'Rocchi, M', 'Meneveri, R', 'Marozzi, A', 'Cavalleri, D', 'Peri, E', 'Poli, G', 'Ginelli, E']","['Agresti A', 'Ponti W', 'Rocchi M', 'Meneveri R', 'Marozzi A', 'Cavalleri D', 'Peri E', 'Poli G', 'Ginelli E']","['Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, University of Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Pregnancy']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 1993 Mar;54(3):373-8.,,,,,,,,,,

However, functional activity, as measured by recovery from an acid load [intracellular pH (pHi) 6.5] increased by only about twofold. In addition, basal pHi (measured in the absence of bicarbonate) increased from 7.15 to 7.26, suggesting an alteration in the antiporter's ""set point"" during HL-60 cell differentiation. To gain insight into the role of the Na(+)-H+ antiporter in HL-60 cell differentiation, we studied mRNA expression of the NHE-1, NHE-3, and NHE-4 isoforms. Only the NHE-1 isoform mRNA increased during differentiation. Because it has recently been shown that the antiporter is regulated by phosphorylation, we next studied NHE-1 protein phosphorylation during HL-60 cell differentiation. Differentiation by exposure to 1 microM retinoic acid for 6 days caused a 15-fold increase in the synthesis of the NHE-1 protein. However, immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled antiporter showed a decrease in band intensity. These data indicate that during HL-60 cell differentiation, there was a net decrease in the phosphorylation of NHE-1 despite an increase in pHi. Nonetheless, recovery from an acid load (pHi 6.51) was significantly more rapid in differentiated than control cells: 62 +/- 6 vs. 38 +/- 8 mmol H+.min-1.1 cells-1, respectively.

We have constructed a series of retroviral vectors to transduce these genes and compare their inhibitory activities. The inhibitory activities were measured with transient transfection assays by using a reporter which expresses an HIV-1 gag-Escherichia coli lacZ fusion protein with strict dependence on coexpression of both tat and rev. Additionally, the vectors were packaged as amphotropic virions and used to stably transduce human CEM T lymphocytes. The transduced CEM cells were challenged with HIV-1, and the effects of the mutant HIV-1 genes were determined by measuring the levels of HIV-1 p24gag produced. A tat gene substituted at amino acid 41 (tatk41a) retained partial trans-activating activity and lacked inhibitory activity. A tat gene with a premature stop codon at amino acid 54 (tat54ter) showed moderate trans-dominant inhibition of the reporter plasmid but failed to significantly inhibit HIV-1 replication. The M10 rev mutant, with a 2-amino-acid substitution, showed strong trans-dominant inhibitory activity both in the reporter plasmid and in the HIV-1 infection assay. The greatest inhibition of HIV-1 growth was seen when M10 was expressed under the transcriptional control of a human cytomegalovirus promoter; slightly less inhibition was achieved when expression of M10 was controlled by the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat, and minimal inhibition was seen when the HIV-1 long terminal repeat controlled the M10 gene. These results demonstrate the potential utility of retroviral vectors expressing trans-dominant inhibitory mutant HIV-1 genes for gene therapy approaches to AIDS.","['Bahner, I', 'Zhou, C', 'Yu, X J', 'Hao, Q L', 'Guatelli, J C', 'Kohn, D B']","['Bahner I', 'Zhou C', 'Yu XJ', 'Hao QL', 'Guatelli JC', 'Kohn DB']","['Division of Research Immunology/Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)'],IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Genes, Dominant/*genetics', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Genes, gag/genetics', 'Genes, rev/genetics', 'Genes, tat/genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lac Operon', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/genetics', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transformation, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.6.3199-3207.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jun;67(6):3199-207. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.6.3199-3207.1993.,"['1PO1 NS26991-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'RFA 89-AI-19 AI25959/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC237659,

A previous pharmacokinetic study in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia raised the possibility that the absorption of orally administered all-trans-RA is a saturable process that would have significant clinical impact on dosing strategies. PURPOSE: This study was specifically designed to examine the saturability of all-trans-RA absorption by measuring the effect of doubling the oral dose of all-trans-RA on plasma drug concentration in patients receiving long-term oral therapy. METHODS: Six patients with solid tumors received oral doses of 10-mg gelatin capsules of all-trans-RA. Patients were studied on 2 consecutive days after they received 28 days of all-trans-RA administered as two daily 78-mg/m2 doses. The study assigned the patients to two groups. Three patients took a 156-mg/m2 dose on day 28 and a 78-mg/m2 dose on day 29; the other three patients took the lower dose on day 28 and the double dose on day 29. Blood samples for the determination of all-trans-RA plasma concentration were obtained at 30-minute intervals starting just prior to drug administration and continuing for a total of 7 hours. The plasma concentration of all-trans-RA was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Plasma concentrations following an oral dose of all-trans-RA were highly variable, with peak concentrations ranging from 0.07 to 1.2 microM for the 78-mg/m2 dose level. Doubling the dose from 78 to 156 mg/m2 increased plasma concentration in all six patients, but the increase was unpredictable and not related to dose, ranging from less than a 1.2-fold to more than a 10-fold increase. CONCLUSION: The current study does not support the hypothesis that the gastrointestinal absorption of all-trans-RA involves a saturable process but instead suggests that absorption is highly variable among patients. This wide interpatient variability suggests that pharmacokinetic drug monitoring may have an important role in the management of patients receiving all-trans-RA.","['Adamson, P C', 'Pitot, H C', 'Balis, F M', 'Rubin, J', 'Murphy, R F', 'Poplack, D G']","['Adamson PC', 'Pitot HC', 'Balis FM', 'Rubin J', 'Murphy RF', 'Poplack DG']","['Pediatric Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biological Availability', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/drug therapy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Skin Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1993/06/16 00:00,1993/06/16 00:01,['1993/06/16 00:00'],"['1993/06/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/16 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.12.993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Jun 16;85(12):993-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.12.993.,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the activity of JM216 administered by the p.o. route has been determined in vivo using the murine ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma and four human ovarian carcinoma xenograft lines. In vitro, against seven human ovarian carcinoma cell lines, JM216 showed similar cytotoxicity and pattern of cytotoxicity to cisplatin (mean 50% inhibitory concentrations of 3.5 microM for cisplatin and 1.7 microM for JM216). The cytotoxicity of JM216 was more dependent on the time of drug exposure than that of cisplatin, suggesting that extended split-dosing rather than a single bolus administration might be a more appropriate schedule in patients. Using six pairs of acquired cisplatin-resistant and parent human tumor cell lines (four ovarian, one testicular, and one cervical) JM216 exhibited non-cross-resistance (resistance factor of < 1.5) in three whereas tetraplatin exhibited partial or full cross-resistance in all six pairs. Notably, in two of the acquired cisplatin-resistant lines (41McisR and HX/155cisR) where JM216 retained activity, resistance has previously shown to be due primarily to reduced platinum uptake. In vivo, following p.o. administration using the cisplatin-sensitive murine ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma, JM216 showed antitumor selectivity far superior to that observed for either cisplatin, carboplatin, or tetraplatin. Across four human ovarian carcinoma xenografts of widely differing sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin, JM216 exhibited p.o. activity, broadly comparable to that observed for i.v. administered cisplatin and carboplatin and markedly superior to i.p. administered tetraplatin. These antitumor properties suggest that JM216 provides a structural lead to platinum complexes which may circumvent transport-determined acquired resistance to cisplatin and is a suitable candidate as an p.o. administrable platinum complex for phase I clinical trial.","['Kelland, L R', 'Abel, G', 'McKeage, M J', 'Jones, M', 'Goddard, P M', 'Valenti, M', 'Murrer, B A', 'Harrap, K R']","['Kelland LR', 'Abel G', 'McKeage MJ', 'Jones M', 'Goddard PM', 'Valenti M', 'Murrer BA', 'Harrap KR']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Belmont, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '8D7B37T28G (satraplatin)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carboplatin/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/drug therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jun 1;53(11):2581-6.,,,,,,,,,,

The report that 80% of patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors have either carcinoma in situ or atrophic tubules as evidence of tumor rejection emphasizes the need to investigate the testis in patients with undiagnosed primary cancer because even today treatment delay is worsening prognosis. The evidence that testicular atrophy is a precursor of malignancy may explain why testis cancer has increased while normal sperm count has fallen over the past 50 years and why there is an association between exposure during service in Vietnam to agents that damage spermatogenesis and development of testis cancer. The improved prognostication from analysis of large databases and salvage with high-dose chemotherapy and bone marrow rescue are giving confidence to explore new innovations, eg, carboplatin instead of cisplatin. In addition, as the database on patients with stage I disease on surveillance enlarges, so does interest in adjuvant chemotherapy, encouraging the search for better markers to predict poor response. Linkage between overproduction of the tumor marker lactate dehydrogenase-1 and the increased copy number of the isochrome 12p in the tumor may be of use in this respect. Reports that germ cell tumor patients exposed to etoposide, eg, leukemic, lung, and ovarian cancer patients, can develop an acute myeloid leukemia with a marker on chromosome 11 are tempering enthusiasm for its use in adjuvant therapy. However, the observation that radiotherapy or chemotherapy may reduce second testis tumor incidence more effectively than surgery does encourages more detailed exploration of the results of adjuvant treatment.","['Oliver, T', 'Mead, G']","['Oliver T', 'Mead G']","['Medical College, Royal London Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Oncol,Current opinion in oncology,9007265,,IM,"['*Dysgerminoma/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/epidemiology/pathology/therapy', '*Testicular Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology/therapy']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001622-199305000-00018 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Oncol. 1993 May;5(3):559-67. doi: 10.1097/00001622-199305000-00018.,,,,,,52,,,,

It was recently shown that clonally expanded CD3- LGLs from Japanese patients contain Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA sequences, arguing for a direct causative role for EBV in NK cell leukemia. The aggressive clinical course and other clinical features of these Japanese patients differ markedly from the clinical features of LGL leukemia and CD3- LDGL patients in the United States and Europe, suggesting different pathogenic mechanisms. Therefore, we performed serologic and DNA hybridization studies for EBV in 31 patients from the United States and Europe (18 with LGL leukemia and 13 with chronic CD3- LDGL). All patients had serologic evidence for past infection with EBV. We did not detect EBV DNA sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA from any of these patients in Southern blot hybridization analyses. EBV DNA sequences were detected after polymerase chain reaction amplification of peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA in only 2 of 18 LGL leukemia patients and 4 of 13 chronic CD3- LDGL patients.

The addition of TNF-alpha to a uniform population of FeLV-infected cells (feline embryonic fibroblasts) caused an enhancement of viral expression (P < .05).

It has been shown that LDV infects and replicates in motorneurons of the spinal cord of old, immunosuppressed C58 mice, which results in an acute poliomyelitis. In spite of extensive study, cells or cell lines other than macrophages which could support LDV infection and replication in vitro have not yet been detected. We have shown that LDV can replicate in mouse or rat cell lines which were previously infected with ecotropic murine leukaemia virus (MuLV). It was examined in this study whether other types of MuLV (dualtropic, amphotropic and xenotropic viruses) can also render the mouse cells or cells of other species susceptible to LDV infection as well as the ecotropic viruses. LDV infection and replication were seen in mouse cells infected with ecotropic, dual-tropic and amphotropic viruses. These were also seen in mink, rabbit and human cell lines infected with dual-, ampho- and xenotropic viruses. These results suggested that virtually all four classes of MuLV have the ability to elicit, in mouse cells or cells from heterologous species, permissiveness to LDV infection. The percent of LDV-infected cells increased up to approximately 80% in concentrated neurovirulent LDV-C-infected ecotropic MuLV-infected-mouse cells. The susceptibility of the cells gradually declined when they were maintained for more than one month. The LDV antigen-positive cells appeared as early as 6-8 h p.i., when a large amount of LDV and MuLV were added simultaneously. The replication of LDV was inhibited in MuLV-infected cells which had been treated previously with actinomycin D and cycloheximide, but not with zidovudine (AZT). A small percent of mouse cells became susceptible to LDV, when the cells were treated with iododeoxyuridine. This suggested that the induction of endogenous MuLV or part(s) of its genome from mouse chromosomes resulted in cells that were permissive to LDV.","['Inada, T']",['Inada T'],"['Central Virus Diagnostic Laboratory, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacology', 'Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus/drug effects/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Mink', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/growth & development', 'Rabbits', 'Virulence', 'Virus Replication/drug effects', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0168-1702(93)90038-O [pii]', '10.1016/0168-1702(93)90038-o [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 1993 Mar;27(3):267-81. doi: 10.1016/0168-1702(93)90038-o.,,,,,,,,,,

Cells of KY-Ra and KY-VCR proliferated in response to natural interleukin-1 (nIL-1), whereas the proliferation of KY-821 and KY-MTX was inhibited. Unexpectedly, recombinant IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta had no effect on the proliferation of each cell line. The effect of nIL-1 was partially deleted by an addition of optimal anti-IL-1. Supernatants of each cell line had no IL-1 activity. Interferon gamma (IFN gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) also had an inhibitory effect for KY-821 and KY-MTX, but lacked such effect in KY-RA and KY-VCR. nIL-1, IFN gamma and TNF alpha could not differentiate between any of the cell lines but IFN gamma and TNF alpha induced monocytic surface antigens. In addition, there was no difference in the number of IL-1 and TNF alpha receptors in each cell line. These results indicate that there is a difference in biological effects between nIL-1 and recombinant IL-1 species and acquirement of resistance for some types of drugs may associate closely with different responses to hematopoietic growth factors, probably through altered postmembranous transduction.","['Fukuda, T', 'Kakihara, T', 'Kamishima, T', 'Ohnishi, Y', 'Naito, M', 'Kishi, K', 'Shibata, A']","['Fukuda T', 'Kakihara T', 'Kamishima T', 'Ohnishi Y', 'Naito M', 'Kishi K', 'Shibata A']","['Second Department of Pathology, Niigata University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Antigens, Surface/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-1/analysis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90019-H [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90019-h [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Apr;17(4):325-32. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90019-h.,,,,,,,,,,

(1990) Ciba Found. Symp. 150, 112-127). Screening with the antisera indicates that PIPLC beta 3 is present in a variety of cell lines and rat tissues, whereas the distribution of PIPLC beta 1 and beta 2 is more restricted. A combination of conventional and immunoaffinity chromatographic techniques was used to purify PIPLC beta 1 and beta 3 from rat brain membranes. PIPLC beta 2 was purified from cytosol of HL60 cells. All three subtypes were activated by purified G protein alpha q/11 subunits with the following relative efficacies: PIPLC beta 3 > or = PIPLC beta 1 >> PIPLC beta 2. All three PIPLC subtypes were also activated by G protein beta gamma subunits with varying efficacies. The presence of beta gamma subunits depressed the ability of alpha q/11 to activate PIPLC beta 1 and beta 3 at low Mg2+ concentrations (1 mM). At higher concentrations of Mg2+ (2 mM or greater), activation of PIPLC beta 3, but not PIPLC beta 1, by beta gamma and alpha q/11 became additive. PIPLC beta 3 was activated by alpha q/11 even in the presence of a saturating concentration of beta gamma subunits.

Such DNA digestion can be induced by both physiological stimuli and cytotoxic treatment with many anticancer agents. This digestion has generally been considered to be mediated by a Ca2+/Mg(2+)-dependent endonuclease that is activated by increases in intracellular Ca2+. However, we suggest that an alternate endonuclease, DNase II, may be a more likely candidate. In these studies, apoptosis was induced in human HL-60 cells by a 30-min incubation with the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. DNA digestion characteristic of apoptosis began within 3 h of removal of etoposide. Morphological indication of apoptosis was observed concurrently. Only about 20% of the cells underwent apoptosis at this time; these appeared to be cells in S phase at the time of etoposide treatment. The remainder of the cells progressed to the G2 phase and arrested there for at least 48 h. Intracellular Ca2+ and pH were measured in individual cells by flow cytometry. No changes in intracellular Ca2+ were observed, but an acidification of up to 1 pH unit occurred in about 15% of the cells and correlated with the time course of appearance of DNA digestion. Cells were sorted on the basis of intracellular pH and only the acidic cells showed the morphology and DNA digestion characteristic of apoptosis. These results demonstrate the involvement of DNase II in apoptotic DNA digestion and suggest mechanisms of pH homeostasis as regulators of apoptosis.","['Barry, M A', 'Reynolds, J E', 'Eastman, A']","['Barry MA', 'Reynolds JE', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755-3835.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endonucleases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/15 00:00,1993/05/15 00:01,['1993/05/15 00:00'],"['1993/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 May 15;53(10 Suppl):2349-57.,"['CA09658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['E1B', 'c-myc', 'p53']",,,,,,,

Thirty-two patients had repeatedly raised serum transaminases, and eight of these (25%) had evidence of an acute HCV infection. The diagnosis was made by the detection of HCV-RNA in the patients' serum using a complementary DNA/polymerase chain reaction (cDNA/PCR) procedure. All eight patients had received myeloablative chemotherapy and three had undergone bone marrow transplantation. HCV infection contributed significantly to the morbidity of this group of patients in the short term whilst they were undergoing treatment for their underlying haematological condition. The long-term effects have yet to be evaluated. In an attempt to decrease hepatic damage due to HCV, three patients were placed on interferon therapy. None showed a sustained reduction in serum transaminases or HCV viraemia. It is hoped that the introduction of anti-HCV screening of blood donors, will reduce the frequency of transfusion-acquired HCV infections.

Published mutant frequencies yield a wide range of mutation rates per genome per replication, mainly because mutational targets have usually been small and, thus, poor samples of the mutability of the average base. Nevertheless, there is a clear central tendency for lytic RNA viruses (bacteriophage Q beta, poliomyelitis, vesicular stomatitis, and influenza A) to display rates of spontaneous mutation of approximately 1 per genome per replication. This rate is some 300-fold higher than previously reported for DNA-based microbes. Lytic RNA viruses thus mutate at a rate close to the maximum value compatible with viability.

The decreased phosphatase activity may be mainly due to a decrease in the expression of the PP2A protein. The mRNA level of PP2A beta was markedly decreased within 5 h after addition of ATRA, but there was only a slight increase in the mRNA level of PP2A alpha.

We have previously reported that a structural analog of cAMP (dibutyryl cAMP, Bt2cAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels strongly enhanced the PMA-induced interleukin-1 beta(IL-1 beta)-gene expression in human myeloid leukemia cells (THP-1, HL-60). We have now examined the role of AP-1 in the regulation of the IL-1 beta gene expression by PKC and cAMP in THP-1 cells. AP-1 is a complex composed of products of the jun and fos gene families. Our studies show that Bt2cAMP enhances the PMA-induced c-fos and jun-B expression, but inhibits c-jun expression. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assay revealed that Bt2cAMP also increased the PMA-induced AP-1 DNA-binding activity. The functional role of the increased AP-1 DNA-binding activity was studied by transfecting THP-1 cells with reporter constructs containing AP-1 sites [Col-TREx5/TK-CAT and IL-1 beta-X-CAT, which contains the putative 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate(TPA)-responsive element of the IL-1 beta gene]. Transient transfection assay demonstrated that Bt2cAMP similarly increased the PMA-induced transcription from both of these reporter constructs. Taken together, these results suggest that cAMP increases the PMA-induced AP-1 activity which then leads to increased IL-1 beta expression.","['Serkkola, E', 'Hurme, M']","['Serkkola E', 'Hurme M']","['Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17754.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Apr 1;213(1):243-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17754.x.,,,"['c-fos', 'c-jun', 'jun-B']",,,,,,,

Furthermore, they shared the same chromosomal abnormalities (trisomy 7 and t(8;14) translocation) and the same rearrangements of immunoglobulin L and H chain and of c-myc gene loci. These features are those most frequently found in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells and were different from those of the parental cell lines, which, besides cells identical to those of the malignant clones, also contained normal lymphoblastoid cells. Therefore, the cloning procedure used selected for the growth of cells with malignant features. EBV latent antigens were detected in all clones by Western blotting and their pattern of expression resembled that usually observed in BL cells. All the clones were positive for the EBV genome by Southern blotting and had monomorphic EBV-fused termini as determined by using cDNA probes specific for sequences at either end of the viral genome. However, the clones derived from PB-LAM had EBV fused termini of a different size from that of the clones derived from BM-LAM.

The risk of transmitting hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been progressively and efficiently reduced in the last years by the successive introduction of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening, elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), antibody to hepatitis B core (HBc Ab), and more recently antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV Ab). The risk of transmitting human retroviruses like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus (HTLV) has also been reduced drastically thanks to screening for corresponding antibodies. However, except for HBs Ag screening, the immunoassays used for HCV, HIV, or HTLV only detect antibodies. Therefore, although they are infectious, a few blood units may be not discarded. The efficacy of preventive measures depends on the incubation time, the infectivity during this silent phase, and the sensitivity of screening procedures. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and parvovirus B 19 are responsible for common infections. Consequently, 30% to more than 50% adults have serologic evidence of past infection. However, both viruses may cause severe primo-infections in some circumstances, especially in pregnant women or immunodeficient individuals.","['Barin, F']",['Barin F'],"['Laboratoire de Virologie, URA CNRS 1334, CHRU Bretonneau et UFR Sciences Pharmaceutiques, Tours.']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Rev Fr Transfus Hemobiol,Revue francaise de transfusion et d'hemobiologie : bulletin de la Societe nationale de transfusion sanguine,8908966,,IM,"['Cytomegalovirus Infections/transmission', 'Erythema Infectiosum/transmission', 'Hepatitis, Viral, Human/transmission', 'Humans', 'Retroviridae Infections/transmission', 'Risk Factors', '*Transfusion Reaction', 'Virus Diseases/*transmission']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s1140-4639(05)80169-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Fr Transfus Hemobiol. 1993 Jan;36(1):73-81. doi: 10.1016/s1140-4639(05)80169-8.,,,,,,19,,Risques viraux lies a la transfusion sanguine.,,

Several cell lines, selected for resistance to topo II-interactive drugs, show decreased expression or activity of topo II, suggesting that such a decrease may be responsible for drug resistance. In the present study, etoposide resistance was used as the selection strategy to isolate genetic suppressor elements (GSEs) from a retroviral library expressing random fragments of human topo II (alpha form) cDNA. Twelve GSEs were isolated, encoding either peptides corresponding to short segments of the topo II alpha molecule (2.4-6.5% of the protein) or 163- to 220-bp-long antisense RNA sequences. Expression of a GSE encoding antisense RNA led to decreased cellular expression of the topo II alpha protein. Both types of GSE induced resistance to several topo II poisons but not to drugs that do not act at topo II. These results provide direct evidence that inhibition of topo II results in resistance to topo II-interactive drugs, indicate structural domains of topo II capable of independent functional interactions, and demonstrate that expression selection of random fragments constitutes an efficient approach to the generation of GSEs in mammalian cells.","['Gudkov, A V', 'Zelnick, C R', 'Kazarov, A R', 'Thimmapaya, R', 'Suttle, D P', 'Beck, W T', 'Roninson, I B']","['Gudkov AV', 'Zelnick CR', 'Kazarov AR', 'Thimmapaya R', 'Suttle DP', 'Beck WT', 'Roninson IB']","['Department of Genetics, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612-7309.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Gene Library', '*Genes, Suppressor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Antisense/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.8.3231 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Apr 15;90(8):3231-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.8.3231.,"['CA39365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40333/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56736/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC46273,

Here we report the identification and characterization of an IL-6 immediate-early response element in the junB promoter (designated JRE-IL6) in HepG2 cells. The JRE-IL6 element, located at -149 to -124, contains two DNA motifs, an Ets-binding site (EBS) (CAGGAAGC) and a CRE-like site (TGACGCGA). Functional studies using variously mutated JRE-IL6 elements showed that both motifs were necessary and sufficient for IL-6 response of the promoter. The EBS of the JRE-IL6 element (JEBS) appears to bind a protein in the Ets family or a related protein which could also form a major complex with the EBSs of the murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 long terminal repeat. The CRE-like site appears to weakly bind multiple CREB-ATF family proteins. Despite the similarity in the structure between the JRE-IL6 element and the polyomavirus enhancer PyPEA3, composed of an EBS and an AP1-binding site and known to be activated by a variety of oncogene signals, JRE-IL6 could not be activated by activated Ha-Ras, Raf-1, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. We show that IL-6 activates JRE-IL6 through an H7-sensitive pathway that does not involve protein kinase C, cyclic AMP-dependent kinase, Ca(2+)- or calmodulin-dependent kinases, Ras, Raf-1, or NF-IL6 (C/EBP beta). The combination of JEBS and the CRE-like site appears to form the basis for the selective and efficient response of JRE-IL6 to IL-6 signals, but not to signals generated by activated Ha-Ras, Raf-1, or protein kinase C.","['Nakajima, K', 'Kusafuka, T', 'Takeda, T', 'Fujitani, Y', 'Nakae, K', 'Hirano, T']","['Nakajima K', 'Kusafuka T', 'Takeda T', 'Fujitani Y', 'Nakae K', 'Hirano T']","['Division of Molecular Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Genes, jun/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics/metabolism']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.5.3027-3041.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 May;13(5):3027-41. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.5.3027-3041.1993.,,,"['junB', 'lacZ']",,,,,,PMC359695,

Conversely, the attenuation or inhibition of cAMP-stimulated gene transcription would require the dephosphorylation of CREB by a nuclear protein phosphatase. In HepG2 cells treated with the protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, dibutyryl-cAMP-stimulated transcription from the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) promoter was enhanced over the level of PEPCK gene transcription observed in cells treated with dibutyryl-cAMP alone. This process was mediated, at least in part, by a region of the PEPCK promoter that binds CREB. Likewise, okadaic acid prevents the dephosphorylation of PKA-phosphorylated CREB in rat liver nuclear extracts and enhances the ability of PKA to stimulate transcription from the PEPCK promoter in cell-free reactions. The ability of okadaic acid to enhance PKA-stimulated transcription in vitro was entirely dependent on the presence of CREB in the reactions. The phospho-CREB (P-CREB) phosphatase activity present in nuclear extracts coelutes with protein Ser/Thr phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) on Mono Q, amino-hexyl Sepharose, and heparin agarose columns and was chromatographically resolved from nuclear protein Ser/Thr-phosphatase type 1 (PP1). Furthermore, P-CREB phosphatase activity in nuclear extracts was unaffected by the heat-stable protein inhibitor-2, which is a potent and selective inhibitor of PP1. Nuclear PP2A dephosphorylated P-CREB 30-fold more efficiently than did nuclear PP1. Finally, when PKA-phosphorylated CREB was treated with immunopurified PP2A and PP1, the PP2A-treated CREB did not stimulate transcription from the PEPCK promoter in vitro, whereas the PP1-treated CREB retained the ability to stimulate transcription. Nuclear PP2A appears to be the primary phosphatase that dephosphorylates PKA-phosphorylated CREB.","['Wadzinski, B E', 'Wheat, W H', 'Jaspers, S', 'Peruski, L F Jr', 'Lickteig, R L', 'Johnson, G L', 'Klemm, D J']","['Wadzinski BE', 'Wheat WH', 'Jaspers S', 'Peruski LF Jr', 'Lickteig RL', 'Johnson GL', 'Klemm DJ']","['Division of Basic Sciences, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, Colorado 80206.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)', 'EC 4.1.1.32 (Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP))']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular', 'Cell Nucleus/*enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ethers, Cyclic/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Liver Neoplasms', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxykinase (GTP)/genetics', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.5.2822-2834.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 May;13(5):2822-34. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.5.2822-2834.1993.,['DK37871/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC359667,

These two cases raise the possibility of PRCA being associated with a clonal proliferation of T-cells and further studies are warranted.","['Sivakumaran, M', 'Bhavnani, M', 'Stewart, A', 'Roberts, B E', 'Geary, G C']","['Sivakumaran M', 'Bhavnani M', 'Stewart A', 'Roberts BE', 'Geary GC']","['Department of Molecular Haematology, Leeds General Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/etiology/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2257.1993.tb00115.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 1993;15(1):1-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.1993.tb00115.x.,,,,,,,,,,

Because TNF induces production of interleukin-6 (IL-6), which has been shown to be a growth factor for myeloma and other transformed B cells, we examined the possibility that IL-6 mediates the growth-stimulatory effect of TNF on B-CLL cells. In fact, we found that IL-6 is an inhibitor of B-CLL growth. The addition of recombinant human IL-6 markedly decreased the TNF-induced B-CLL growth, and this decrease was even greater when soluble IL-6 receptor, known to act as IL-6 agonist, was added with recombinant IL-6. Conversely, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 and to the IL-6 receptor potentiated the growth stimulation of TNF on B-CLL cells, in line with the possibility that IL-6 functions as a negative feedback regulator of an autocrine TNF action on these B-leukemic cells. Evidence is presented that production of IL-6 by monocytes and B cells of CLL patients is low, suggesting that administration of IL-6 may be beneficial in CLL to reduce the eventual growth stimulation by TNF and, possibly, also the deficiency in platelets and Ig production in this disease.","['Aderka, D', 'Maor, Y', 'Novick, D', 'Engelmann, H', 'Kahn, Y', 'Levo, Y', 'Wallach, D', 'Revel, M']","['Aderka D', 'Maor Y', 'Novick D', 'Engelmann H', 'Kahn Y', 'Levo Y', 'Wallach D', 'Revel M']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Virology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'CHO Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cricetinae', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80494-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Apr 15;81(8):2076-84.,,,,,,,,,,

The Gag polyprotein encoded by the defective virus, termed BM5def, differs most in p12 from that of nonpathogenic ecotropic virus (BM5eco). As one approach to examining the role of p12 in disease, the ecotropic and defective virus forms of the protein, synthesized in bacteria, were used to immunize three strains of mice differing in their sensitivity to MAIDS. In each strain, both proteins elicited substantial antibody responses that were cross-reactive with either p12 and recognized the proteins as part of intact viral Gag polyproteins. Immunization with either p12 before infection with LP-BM5 viruses had no effect on the sensitivity or resistance of mice to MAIDS or on the extent of helper virus spread. The variant p12 of BM5def, when presented on its own, is thus not a crucial antigenic determinant of disease. Alternative mechanisms by which BM5def may contribute to MAIDS are discussed.","['Tang, Y', 'Hugin, A W', 'Hartley, J W', 'Fredrickson, T N', 'Morse, H C 3rd', 'Chattopadhyay, S K']","['Tang Y', 'Hugin AW', 'Hartley JW', 'Fredrickson TN', 'Morse HC 3rd', 'Chattopadhyay SK']","['Laboratory of Immunopathology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Austria,Arch Virol,Archives of virology,7506870,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Defective Viruses/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag/*immunology', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/*prevention & control']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01316892 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Virol. 1993;129(1-4):155-66. doi: 10.1007/BF01316892.,['N01-AI-72622/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

During culture of the monocytes in vitro cytotoxicity decreased during the first 48 h but tumoricidal competence was restored after 3 to 4 days in vitro. These changes were accompanied by changes in both reactive oxygen intermediate generating capacity and reactive nitrogen intermediate production. Lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence stimulated with either FMLP or PMA declined during the first 2 days in culture and was negligible during the later days in culture. Superoxide radical production in response to either FMLP or PMA remained fairly constant for the first few days in vitro and then declined.

The return to tumoricidal competence after 3 to 4 days in culture was decreased by the addition of NG-monomethyl-L-arginine.

Ten days after hatching, 2 out of 360 birds tested positive and at 286 days of age about 60% of the birds had been antigen positive at least once. 2. Among the antigen positive birds, two groups could be distinguished: those which permanently and those which transiently expressed viral antigen. Permanent antigen expression was associated with low antibody titres, while transient antigen expression was associated with high antibody titres. 3. The strain segregated for the two endogenous viral genes ev6 and ev9, both of which express endogenous viral envelope protein, and have been implicated in affecting immune-responsiveness. The antibody titre in individuals positive for both ev6 and ev9, was significantly lower than in those which had none or only one of the two ev-genes. In addition, individuals positive for both ev-genes occurred more frequently in the group permanently positive for viral antigen than in the group transiently antigen positive. 4. The results indicate that there was a strong synergism between ev6 and ev9 in reducing the antibody response to exogenous avian leukosis virus infection, perhaps by inducing immune tolerance or interfering with antibody formation.","['Kuhnlein, U', 'Fairfull, R W', 'Gowe, R', 'Kulenkamp, A', 'Mou, L', 'Zadworny, D']","['Kuhnlein U', 'Fairfull RW', 'Gowe R', 'Kulenkamp A', 'Mou L', 'Zadworny D']","['Department of Animal Science, McGill University, Ste.

This series is homogeneous because of the same diagnostic procedures, BMT technique and supportive care (exclusive seronegative blood products, no CMV immunoglobulin, no prophylactic antiviral). The incidence of CMV infection and CMV interstitial pneumonitis (CMV-IP) were 44% and 13% respectively, of whom five patients died. Variables such as age, sex, underlying disease, conditioning regimen and occurrence of GVHD were not found as significant risk factors. We confirm that the only major factor was recipient's serology as CMV infection and IP occurred in 4% and 0% respectively among negative recipients (R-) compared with 79% and 25% among positive R. In contrast to some studies among R+, neither donor's immunity nor recipient's CMV humoral response improved the clinical outcome. This study validates the good predictive value of viremia and urinary virus excretion for the occurrence of CMV-IP (respectively positive in 11 and 13 patients out of 13 with IP), always preceding IP by a median of 37 and 27 days. The highest risk patients for lethal CMV-IP were older recipients (> 30 years). Thus, prospective prophylactic trials with antiviral agents are suggested in such viremic or viruric patients. Furthermore, the use of seronegative blood products is highly effective and sufficient to prevent CMV infection in R-patients.","['Rubie, H', 'Attal, M', 'Campardou, A M', 'Gayet-Mengelle, C', 'Payen, C', 'Sanguignol, F', 'Calot, J P', 'Charlet, J P', 'Robert, A', 'Huguet, F']","['Rubie H', 'Attal M', 'Campardou AM', 'Gayet-Mengelle C', 'Payen C', 'Sanguignol F', 'Calot JP', 'Charlet JP', 'Robert A', 'Huguet F', 'et al.']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Purpan, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Viral/etiology', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1993 Mar;11(3):209-14.,,,,,,,,,,

Modulation of the receptor in permeabilized cells by the cytosolic compartment.",115-24,"Engagement of the IP3 receptor by its ligand releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores of the rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cell. The IP3 receptor in washed permeabilized cells has high affinity (Kd = 1.2 +/- 0.3 nM) for [3H]IP3 and is not sensitive to physiological concentrations of Ca2+. Moreover, washed permeabilized cells only release small amounts of Ca2+ when stimulated with IP3. When [3H]IP3 binding to permeabilized cells is performed in the presence of cytosolic constituents (unwashed cells), the IP3 receptor has a lower affinity for [3H]IP3 (Kd from 20 to 100 nM) and has enhanced Ca2+ release. Cytosolic supernatant, prepared by centrifugation of permeabilized cells and added back to washed permeabilized cells, decreases [3H]IP3 binding in a dose-dependent manner and increases the amount of Ca2+ released by IP3. Depletion of either MgATP or IP3 in the cytosolic supernatant does not affect the supernatant's ability to decrease [3H]IP3 binding. Though MgATP competitively inhibits [3H]IP3 binding, it cannot fully account for the shift in Kd or the modulation of IP3-stimulated Ca2+ release in the presence of cytosol. These findings suggest that components present in the cytosolic supernatant modulate the function of the IP3 receptor by maintaining it in a low affinity state capable of promoting Ca2+ release.","['Hershey, P E', 'Pessah, I N', 'Mohr, F C']","['Hershey PE', 'Pessah IN', 'Mohr FC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Calcium Channels', 'Cytosol/chemistry/*physiology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Inositol Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Permeability', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/08 00:00,1993/04/08 00:01,['1993/04/08 00:00'],"['1993/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(93)90321-P [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(93)90321-p [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Apr 8;1147(1):115-24. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(93)90321-p.,"['90-16/PHS HHS/United States', 'ES05002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Equilibrium binding studies show a 1.6 +/- 0.1 pmol/mg of protein maximal binding capacity for [3H]IP3 at optimal Ca2+ (10 microM). The specificity of the RBL cell IP3 receptor towards phosphoinositides, ATP and heparin parallels those previously described with excitable and nonexcitable tissues. [3H]IP3 binding is slightly enhanced from < 1 nM to 10 microM Ca2+ and inhibited by > 10 microM Ca2+. Kinetic and equilibrium studies provide evidence for at least two classes or conformational states of binding sites with pico- and nanomolar affinities. At nM concentrations of IP3, neither binding to the IP3 receptor nor IP3-induced Ca2+ efflux from permeabilized cells demonstrates cooperativity. In contrast, at pM concentrations, IP3 binding kinetics deviate from simple mass action suggesting a complex interaction among binding sites for IP3 on the receptor-channel oligomer. The mechanisms that regulate [3H]IP3 binding in RBL cells are unique when compared to what has been reported in other cells.","['Mohr, F C', 'Hershey, P E', 'Zimanyi, I', 'Pessah, I N']","['Mohr FC', 'Hershey PE', 'Zimanyi I', 'Pessah IN']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Calcium Channels', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Microsomes/*chemistry', 'Protein Conformation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/08 00:00,1993/04/08 00:01,['1993/04/08 00:00'],"['1993/04/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/08 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(93)90320-Y [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(93)90320-y [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Apr 8;1147(1):105-14. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(93)90320-y.,"['90-16/PHS HHS/United States', 'ES05002/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A cell clone selected for cAMP resistance had a normally functioning apoptotic machinery whose triggering required about 30-fold higher cellular cAMP than in the parent cells. The cAMP subresponsiveness was due to a heterozygous point mutation (Ala336-->Asp) in the RI subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase I. In fact, apoptosis correlated with intracellular cAMP binding to the subresponsive RI. The mutated alanine is invariantly present in cyclic nucleotide kinases, but of unknown function. The mutation decreased the cAMP affinity to site B by increasing the cAMP dissociation rate 500x. The ability of site B to discriminate adenine-modified cAMP analogues was affected, suggesting that Ala336 faced the adenine moiety of cAMP. That the heterozygously expressed RID336 was a dominant suppressor of apoptosis was explained by a higher expression of R than C subunits in the mutant cells by preferential expression of the mutant form of RI, and by the ability of mutant RI to exert dominant negative control of activation of wild type cAMP kinase at moderate cAMP levels. Apoptosis was induced at a similar cAMP level in cells treated with cholera toxin or other cAMP elevating agents, indicating that cAMP kinase was essential for toxin action.","['Duprez, E', 'Gjertsen, B T', 'Bernard, O', 'Lanotte, M', 'Doskeland, S O']","['Duprez E', 'Gjertsen BT', 'Bernard O', 'Lanotte M', 'Doskeland SO']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U301, Institute of Hematology, Centre Hayem, Hopital St. Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['*Alanine', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', '*Aspartic Acid', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclic AMP/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Heterozygote', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Protein Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53100-8 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 15;268(11):8332-40.,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify another prominent tyrosine-phosphorylated protein as LIF receptor (LIFR) beta, which was originally cloned as a LIF-binding protein. Cross-linking experiments with iodinated factors were carried out on a cell line responsive to CNTF and LIF, as well as on COS cells that were cotransfected with various combinations of gp130, LIFR beta, and CNTF receptor (CNTFR) alpha, the previously cloned CNTF-binding protein. These experiments reveal that LIF cross-links to LIFR beta alone, as well as to gp130 when it is coexpressed with LIFR beta. However, cross-linking of CNTF to LIFR beta and gp130 is only observed in the presence of CNTFR alpha. These and other data show that the two known LIF receptor components are recruited by CNTF and CNTFR alpha to form a trimeric CNTF receptor complex.","['Stahl, N', 'Davis, S', 'Wong, V', 'Taga, T', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Ip, N Y', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Stahl N', 'Davis S', 'Wong V', 'Taga T', 'Kishimoto T', 'Ip NY', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology, Osaka University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1993/04/15 00:00,1993/04/15 00:01,['1993/04/15 00:00'],"['1993/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53001-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Apr 15;268(11):7628-31.,,,,,,,,,,

Uptake studies were performed in Xenopus oocytes injected with cRNA encoding these proteins. The comparison of the two transporters in these studies demonstrated that, unlike the widely-expressed transporter, arginine uptake mediated by the liver carrier is significant only at substrate concentrations that exceed systemic plasma levels and is less dependent on the intracellular concentration of cationic amino acids.

When these constructs were cloned into a BLV vector in place of its oncogenic region, and transfected into MDBK cells, bGRF was expressed. Virus particles were prepared from these cultures and used to deliver the bGRF gene by viral infection into fresh MDBK cells. Northern blot analysis of MDBK total RNA revealed a fivefold higher level of expression of bGRF mRNA in transfected cultures than in virally infected cells, and no expression was detected in control cultures.

Sequence analysis showed that the hormone receptors comprise a large superfamily of ligand-responsive transcription factors. Upon binding to hormones, the receptors interact with specific hormone response elements located in the promoters of numerous genes. Promoter-bound receptors communicate with distinct receptors and/or additional members of the transcriptional machinery, frequently evoking protein-protein interactions. Ultimately, this results in the induction of complex gene systems that control hormone-induced processes such as differentiation, cell growth, and homeostasis. In addition to the genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the lipophilic hormones, particularly glucocorticoids, can also modulate RNA polymerase I-directed transcription of the ribosomal gene. For both transcription systems, activation and repression of genes in response to hormones have been reported. Finally, the involvement of hormone receptors in tumorigenesis has been discussed. It is likely that receptor studies will have major implications in the diagnosis and therapy of diseases such as leukemia.","['Reichel, R R', 'Jacob, S T']","['Reichel RR', 'Jacob ST']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Biology, Chicago Medical School, Illinois 60064.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Hormones)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipids/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/*genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1096/fasebj.7.5.8385039 [doi]'],ppublish,FASEB J. 1993 Mar;7(5):427-36. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.7.5.8385039.,['CA 31894/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,77,,,,

This PBGD-(-112 to +78) promoter contains a CCACC binding site (position -100), a GATA binding site (position -70) and an initiator element around the cap site. Using a cotransfection assay, we find that the human factor GATA-1 trans-activates the PBGD-(-112 to +78) promoter in non-erythroid cells. We show that, if trans-activation is abolished by mutations that destroy either the -100 CCACC binding or the -70 GATA binding sites, replacement of the -100 CCACC binding site by a simian-virus-40-protein-1 (Sp1) binding site maintains both the erythroid-specific activity of this promoter and the human GATA-1 trans-activation. Thus, human GATA-1 acts on the PBGD promoter in association with Sp1 or CCACC binding proteins. This PBGD-(-112 to +78) promoter is activated 20-fold by a cis-linked 5' hypersensitive site 2 (5'HS-2) of the human beta-globin locus control region. This activation depends on the -70 GATA and -100 CCACC or Sp1 binding sites. When a longer -714 to +78 fragment of the PBGD promoter is used, the -70 GATA mutant still displays erythroid-specific activity and is cis-activated by the 5'HS-2 enhancer, while the -100 CCACC mutant is completely inactive in the absence or in the presence of the 5'HS-2 enhancer. Thus, the -100 CCACC binding site is indispensable for the correct activity and sensitivity of the human PBGD promoter to the 5'HS-2 enhancer, whereas the -70 GATA binding site can functionally be replaced by upstream cis-acting elements.","['Eleouet, J F', 'Romeo, P H']","['Eleouet JF', 'Romeo PH']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unite 91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SV40 protein-1-binding protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.61 (Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Point Mutation', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/*metabolism', 'TATA Box', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17716.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Mar 15;212(3):763-70. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb17716.x.,,,,,,,,,,

These characteristics are shared with [3H]leukotriene D4-specific binding in human and guinea-pig lung preparations. However, differences between these leukotriene D4 receptor types were observed. [3H]Leukotriene D4 equilibrium binding to differentiated U937 cell membranes could be dissociated to non-specific binding levels by 1000-fold excess of competing ligand, whereas binding to guinea-pig lung membranes was only partially dissociated under these conditions. In addition, differences in potency were demonstrated in competition studies with leukotriene E4 and leukotriene C4, although leukotriene D4 and the leukotriene D4-receptor antagonists MK-571 and ICI 204,219 were equipotent in competing for [3H]leukotriene D4-specific binding in all three membranes preparations. In conclusion, the leukotriene D4 receptor in differentiated U937 cell membranes resembles that in human lung, validating the use of this cell line as a suitable source of receptor in the development of potent specific antagonists.","['Frey, E A', 'Nicholson, D W', 'Metters, K M']","['Frey EA', 'Nicholson DW', 'Metters KM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Pointe Claire, Dorval, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Cations, Divalent)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Phenylcarbamates)', '0 (Propionates)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene)', '0 (SRS-A)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tosyl Compounds)', '5Q9O54P0H7 (verlukast)', 'XZ629S5L50 (zafirlukast)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cations, Divalent/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Lung/cytology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Phenylcarbamates', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Leukotriene', 'SRS-A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sulfonamides', 'Tosyl Compounds/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-4106(93)90149-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1993 Feb 15;244(3):239-50. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(93)90149-4.,,,,,,,,,,

As a result of this translocation, mRNAs containing the coding sequences of the new gene, fused in-frame either upstream of the RAR alpha B region or downstream from the unique A1 and A2 regions of the two major RAR alpha isoforms, are expressed from the rearranged alleles. The above gene, which we have termed PLZF (for promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger), encodes a potential transcription factor containing nine zinc finger motifs related to the Drosophila gap gene Kruppel and is expressed as at least two isoforms which differ in the sequences encoding the N-terminal region of the protein. Within the haematopoietic system the PLZF mRNAs were detected in the bone marrow, early myeloid cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but not in lymphoid cell lines or tissues. In addition, the PLZF mRNA levels were down-regulated in NB-4 and HL-60 promyelocytic cell lines in response to retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation and were very low in mature granulocytes. Our results demonstrate for the first time the association of a variant chromosomal translocation involving the RAR alpha gene with APL, further implicating the RAR alpha in leukaemogenesis and also suggesting an important role for PLZF as well as retinoic acid and its receptors in myeloid maturation.","['Chen, Z', 'Brand, N J', 'Chen, A', 'Chen, S J', 'Tong, J H', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Waxman, S', 'Zelent, A']","['Chen Z', 'Brand NJ', 'Chen A', 'Chen SJ', 'Tong JH', 'Wang ZY', 'Waxman S', 'Zelent A']","['Shanghai Institute of Haematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Chimera', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', '*Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Tretinoin/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,EMBO J. 1993 Mar;12(3):1161-7.,,,['PLZF'],['GENBANK/Z19002'],,,,,PMC413318,

Recent studies support the view that a drug molecule might be placed at the DNA cleavage site interacting with the two flanking base pairs and amino acid residues of the enzyme. In this work, the DNA sequence-dependent action of mitoxantrone on topoisomerase II DNA cleavage was investigated in SV40 DNA fragments and short oligonucleotides, in comparison to VM-26, 4-demethoxydaunorubicin, and mAMSA. Mitoxantrone and VM-26 had a much lower degree of selectivity than 4-demethoxydaunorubicin and mAMSA in stimulating DNA cleavage. DNA cleavage at sites that were always stimulated also by VM-26. In contrast, mitoxantrone and 4-demethoxydaunorubicin shared only 7% of cleavage sites, and about 70% of the 4-demethoxydaunorubicin-stimulated sites were also stimulated by VM-26. Unlike what is generally seen with anthracyclines, the structurally related drug, mitoxantrone, stimulated cleavage also at DNA sites observed without drugs. Local base preferences at the cleavage site as determined by statistical analysis showed that mitoxantrone preferentially cleaved the DNA at sites with a cytosine or a thymine at position-1. However, strong DNA cleavage stimulation by mitoxantrone was favored by specific base pairs at the next positions flanking the cleaved bond (positions -2 and +2) and at positions +8 and +9. Effects of base mutations on drug stimulation of DNA cleavage in short DNA oligonucleotides independently showed that a pyrimidine at position -1 is required for mitoxantrone action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Capranico, G', 'De Isabella, P', 'Tinelli, S', 'Bigioni, M', 'Zunino, F']","['Capranico G', 'De Isabella P', 'Tinelli S', 'Bigioni M', 'Zunino F']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Agar Gel', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mitoxantrone/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/30 00:00,1993/03/30 00:01,['1993/03/30 00:00'],"['1993/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00063a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1993 Mar 30;32(12):3038-46. doi: 10.1021/bi00063a015.,,,,,,,,,,

Receptors have been identified for IL-8, GRO and NAP-2 on human neutrophils and granulocytic cell lines, and it has been observed that these cytokines can cross-compete for binding to a common receptor. Using the recently characterized rabbit IL-8 receptor as a probe, two classes of cDNAs, termed type 1 and type 2, were isolated from a human neutrophil library. The type 1 receptor binds only IL-8 while the type 2 receptor binds IL-8, GRO and NAP-2 at high affinity when respective cDNAs are expressed in COS-7 cells. The two cDNAs encode proteins that have an amino acid sequence identity of 77% while the type 1 and 2 receptors have an identity of 84 and 74% with the rabbit IL-8 receptor. These receptors also show significant homology with receptors for other chemotactic agents and with potential coding regions from the human cytomegalovirus genome.","['Cerretti, D P', 'Kozlosky, C J', 'Vanden Bos, T', 'Nelson, N', 'Gearing, D P', 'Beckmann, M P']","['Cerretti DP', 'Kozlosky CJ', 'Vanden Bos T', 'Nelson N', 'Gearing DP', 'Beckmann MP']","['Immunex Corporation, Seattle, WA 98101.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (CXCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL1)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Chemotactic Factors)', '0 (Cxcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '0 (melanoma growth stimulating activity receptor)', '69344-77-0 (connective tissue-activating peptide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL1', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Chemotactic Factors/*metabolism', 'DNA/isolation & purification', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*chemistry/metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Thromboglobulin']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0161-5890(93)90065-j [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1993 Mar;30(4):359-67. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(93)90065-j.,,,,,,,,,,

All 20 cats were challenge exposed oronasally (4 times over a 1-week period), beginning 3 weeks after immunization, with a virulent subgroup A strain of FeLV (CT600-FeLV). The severity of the FeLV infection was enhanced by treating the cats with methylprednisolone acetate at the time of the last FeLV exposure. Ten of 10 nonvaccinated cats became persistently viremic compared with 0/10 of the vaccinates. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV were present at high concentrations after immunization in all of the vaccinated cats, and there was no observable anamnestic antibody response after challenge exposure. ELISA antibodies to whole FeLV appeared at low concentrations in the serum of nonvaccinated cats after infection but disappeared as the viremia became permanently established. Virus neutralizing antibodies were detected in 3/10 vaccinates and 0/10 nonvaccinates immediately before FeLV challenge exposure, and in 8/10 vaccinates and 1/10 nonvaccinates 5 weeks later. Although vaccination did not consistently evoke virus neutralizing antibodies, it appeared to immunologically prime cats for a virus-neutralizing antibody response after infection. Active FeLV infection was detected in bone marrow cells taken 14 weeks after infection from 10/10 nonvaccinates and 0/10 vaccinates.

METHODS: MST-16 was administered orally daily for 7 days, with courses repeated at intervals of 2-3 weeks in 24 patients. RESULTS: Two complete remissions (CR) and eight partial remissions (PR) were obtained in 23 evaluable patients who received 1200-2800 mg/day of MST-16. Among 13 acute-type ATLL, one CR and five PR were obtained. Among eight lymphoma-type ATLL, two PR were detected. Among two chronic-type ATLL, one CR and one PR occurred. Remissions were obtained at 7-232 days (median, 23 days) and lasted 43-374 days (median, 68 days). The major toxic effects were leukopenia (68%), anemia (52%), thrombocytopenia (35%), and gastrointestinal disorders (22%). CONCLUSIONS: MST-16 was shown to be effective in ATLL, which has no standard therapy. This drug deserves further clinical trials because it shows little cross resistance to currently available antitumor drugs.","['Ohno, R', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Sakamoto, S', 'Hirano, M', 'Hanada, S', 'Yasunaga, K', 'Yokomaku, S', 'Mitomo, Y', 'Nagai, K']","['Ohno R', 'Masaoka T', 'Shirakawa S', 'Sakamoto S', 'Hirano M', 'Hanada S', 'Yasunaga K', 'Yokomaku S', 'Mitomo Y', 'Nagai K', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'R1308VH37P (sobuzoxane)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2217::aid-cncr2820710709>3.0.co;2-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1993 Apr 1;71(7):2217-21. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19930401)71:7<2217::aid-cncr2820710709>3.0.co;2-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Human HL-60 leukemia cells can be induced to monocytic or granulocytic differentiation with various compounds; amongst them camptothecin, a topoisomerase I inhibitor and VP-16, VM-26 and mitoxantrone, all potent topoisomerase II inhibitors. During HL-60 cell differentiation topoisomerase I activity increases and topoisomerase II activity decreases. The two isoenzymes topoisomerase II alpha and topoisomerase II beta seem to have different physiological functions in highly proliferating cells, G0 cells and differentiated cells as their expression is regulated differently. In concentrations sublethal to undifferentiated cells, m-AMSA, also a potent topoisomerase II inhibitor, is able to prevent DMSO-induced granulocytic HL-60 cell differentiation. In drug-sensitive cells derived from several sources (mouse erythroleukemia, human gastric carcinoma, human leukemia), we found a functional heterogeneity of topoisomerase activity which is altered specifically during cellular differentiation. The isoactivities can be separated by their different pH and salt requirements and they exhibit different sensitivity to topoisomerase II inhibiting drugs. Functional heterogeneity of topoisomerases seems to be a prerequisite to high drug sensitivity of the cells, since drug-resistant sublines in our experiments do not exhibit this heterogeneity. We propose that the topoisomerase II inhibiting drugs which are able to induce differentiation, namely the epipodophyllotoxines VP-16 and VM-26, inhibit subfractions of the topoisomerase II pool which are necessary to maintain the undifferentiated status of the cells. These drugs induce differentiation in concentrations 10-100-fold below the lethal dose, the concentration must be sufficient to inhibit topoisomerase II but well below the concentration to induce the cleavable complex. This might be the reason that anthracyclines with a high DNA binding affinity have low differentiation-inducing capacity.","['Gieseler, F', 'Boege, F', 'Clark, M', 'Meyer, P']","['Gieseler F', 'Boege F', 'Clark M', 'Meyer P']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Toxicol Lett,Toxicology letters,7709027,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-4274(93)90066-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-4274(93)90066-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Lett. 1993 Apr;67(1-3):331-40. doi: 10.1016/0378-4274(93)90066-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Development of such an assay necessitates the identification of drug targets, the ability to measure the drug-target interaction in clinical samples, and the knowledge that measurement of the drug-target interaction is associated with the mechanism by which the drug kills malignant cells.

Northern blot hybridizations revealed that expression of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene was induced immediately after irradiation and was increased for 2 h thereafter. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP also caused a persistent expression of the IL-1 beta gene, although it differed from X rays in that it coincidentally induced expression of the c-fos gene, which was not induced by X rays. Activation of either protein kinase C or calmodulin also induced early expression of both IL-1 beta and c-fos. Myeloid cells collected from the spleen of mice with granulocytic leukemia were X-irradiated in culture as above. The leukemia cells responded to X rays as well as to other stimuli in the same manner as the spleen cells, except that IL-1 beta mRNA was no longer detected 30 min after irradiation while c-fos was detectable for 2 h. When the leukemia cells were irradiated twice with a 3-h interval between irradiations, the second irradiation led to prolonged expression of IL-1 beta without inducing c-fos expression. These results suggest that ionizing radiation elicits early expression of the IL-1 beta gene through a mechanism that does not involve protein kinase C or A, or the transcription factor, c-fos. Whole-body irradiation of mice with 50 Gy 137Cs gamma rays also induced IL-1 beta expression in spleen but not in bone marrow or liver, although there was a delay of several hours before it was amply expressed.

Treatment of these cells with 10(-8) M 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 5 days in a medium containing 10% uremic serum from 4 patients with chronic renal failure resulted in maturation of the cells amounting to 30.3 +/- 18.7 (mean +/- SD) and 32.5 +/- 11.2% maturation by the nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay and the nonspecific esterase assay, respectively. These values were significantly lower than those obtained with 10% normal serum from 3 normal controls (66.6 +/- 12.8 and 58.3 +/- 10.9%, p < 0.02). The occurrence of resistance to 1,25-(OH)2D3 in uremic serum-treated cells was also confirmed when the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 was assessed by the induction of the cell's ability to hydroxylate the C-24 position of 1,25-(OH)2[3H]D3.

Adriamycin (ADR)-resistant HL-60 (HL-60/AR) cells exhibit the multidrug-resistant phenotype but do not express the mdr1 gene product P-glycoprotein. To explore potential signaling processes that may be involved in this atypical form of drug resistance, 8-Cl-cAMP was used as a modulator of the cAMP second messenger signal transduction pathway. Treatment for 48 hr with a 10% inhibitory concentration of 8-Cl-cAMP potentiated ADR cytotoxicity 14-fold in HL-60/AR cells but not in the parental cell line. 8-Cl-cAMP was stable to hydrolysis in the medium after 48 hr and was present intracellularly predominantly as phosphorylated metabolites (70%) and the parent compound (30%). No difference occurred in ADR accumulation in HL-60/AR cells after treatment with 8-Cl-cAMP. Accompanying the 8-Cl-cAMP-mediated increase in ADR cytotoxicity in HL-60/AR cells was a reduction in the cytosolic type I cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and disappearance of the nuclear PKA holoenzyme. Coincident with these changes in drug-resistant cells was a marked reduction in the DNA-binding activity of the cAMP response element-binding protein to levels equivalent to those in sensitive cells. This effect appears to result from reduced phosphorylation of the cAMP response element-binding protein. These results suggest that the potentiation by 8-Cl-cAMP of ADR cytotoxicity in HL-60/AR cells occurs through down-regulation of nuclear type I PKA and cAMP response element-binding factors whose activities are regulated by PKA.","['Rohlff, C', 'Safa, B', 'Rahman, A', 'Cho-Chung, Y S', 'Klecker, R W', 'Glazer, R I']","['Rohlff C', 'Safa B', 'Rahman A', 'Cho-Chung YS', 'Klecker RW', 'Glazer RI']","['Department of Pharmacology, Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C. 20007.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BQ94Z7E5OR (8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Mar;43(3):372-9.,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we examined the presence of acetylcholine receptors, using pharmacological and molecular biological assays, and their transmembrane control and functions, using a biochemical assay, in a cloned human leukemic helper T lymphoma cell line, Jurkat. Several muscarinic agonists, such as acetylcholine, carbachol, muscarine, and oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M), at 100 microM caused a transient elevation of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i), in contrast to the tonic elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by 10 micrograms/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA). It appeared that the elevation induced by Oxo-M, the most potent [Ca2+]i elevator, was more effectively inhibited by p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol hydrochloride (p-F-HHSiD) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodine than by pirenzepine and 11-2[[2-[(diethylamino)methyl]-1-piperidinyl]acetyl]-5,11-dihydro- 6H-pyrido[2,3-b] [1,4]benzodiazepine-6-one (AF-DX 116), suggesting that a pharmacological M3 subtype of muscarinic receptors is involved in the elevation of [Ca2+]i. Northern blot analysis showed that the m3 type of receptors are expressed in Jurkat cells. Scatchard analysis of [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to intact cells indicated a Kd of 14.1 nM and a Bmax of 45,370 binding sites/cell. [3H]Quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to cell membranes was also inhibited by p-F-HHSiD rather than by pirenzepine and AF-DX 116. Oxo-M induced formation of inositol trisphosphate, and 5'-O-(2-thio)diphosphate inhibited the formation. Cholera toxin treatment inhibited the PHA-induced [Ca2+]i rise but did not affect the Oxo-M-induced rise. Neither pertussis nor butulinus (type C) toxin affected the rise induced by Oxo-M or PHA. Thus, bacterial toxin-insensitive GTP-binding proteins seem to be involved in the Oxo-M-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate abolished the Oxo-M-induced [Ca2+]i rise but did not affect that induced by PHA. m3 Muscarinic receptors thus appear to cause Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores via bacteria toxin-insensitive GTP-binding proteins, phospholipase C activation, and inositol trisphosphate formation in Jurkat cells. Protein kinase C seems to negatively modulate the m3 receptor system.","['Kaneda, T', 'Kitamura, Y', 'Nomura, Y']","['Kaneda T', 'Kitamura Y', 'Nomura Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Parasympathomimetics)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Muscarinic)', '5RY0UWH1JL (Oxotremorine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Oxotremorine/pharmacology', 'Parasympathomimetics/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Muscarinic/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1993 Mar;43(3):356-64.,,,,,,,,,,

D3 addition induces a partial monocytic maturation of the cell lines, whereas TGF-beta treatment is largely ineffective. Combined treatment with TGF-beta and D3 causes terminal monocytic maturation, as evaluated both by assessment of a large spectrum of membrane Ag and by functional assays. Furthermore, sequential addition of the two inducers showed that pretreatment with TGF-beta 1 followed by incubation with D3, but not vice versa, induces monocytic maturation as effectively as simultaneous treatment with both agents. In liquid culture the proliferative activity of these cell lines is slightly decreased by D3 and virtually unaffected by TGF-beta, whereas combined treatment with D3 and TGF-beta induces a markedly potentiated inhibitory effect. Furthermore, TGF-beta/D3 treatment (but not D3 alone) elicits the expression of membrane CD14, FcRI, FcRII, CD11a, CD11b, CD11c, ICAM-1, and PECAM-1 Ag at a level comparable to that observed on normal human monocytes. It is noteworthy that several of these Ag play an important role in monocyte physiology (e.g., CD14 Ag mediates the binding of bacterial LPS to monocytes). Treatment with both TGF-beta and D3 (but not D3 alone) induces superoxide anions and H2O2 production similar to that of circulating monocytes. In semisolid culture, D3 and TGF-beta alone cause, respectively, a marked and slight loss of cloning efficiency of the cell lines, whereas their combined addition synergistically results in a complete loss of the cloning capacity. These findings suggest a physiologic role for TGF-beta in monocyte maturation. Furthermore, they may pave the way to the design of clinical protocols combining D3 and TGF-beta in the differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic/myelomonocytic leukemia.","['Testa, U', 'Masciulli, R', 'Tritarelli, E', 'Pustorino, R', 'Mariani, G', 'Martucci, R', 'Barberi, T', 'Camagna, A', 'Valtieri, M', 'Peschle, C']","['Testa U', 'Masciulli R', 'Tritarelli E', 'Pustorino R', 'Mariani G', 'Martucci R', 'Barberi T', 'Camagna A', 'Valtieri M', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/drug effects', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cholecalciferol/*pharmacology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/drug effects', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Mar 15;150(6):2418-30.,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization of the human C5a receptor gene.,1243-50,"The human C5a anaphylatoxin and formyl peptide receptor genes, as well as two genes with high sequence identity to the formyl peptide receptor, FPRH1 and FPRH2, have been mapped to chromosome 19 (Lu et al., 1992). Further analysis reveals that these genes are present in the 19q13.3 band adjacent to the 13.3-13.4 interface. MRNAs for the C5a and formyl peptide receptors, as well as for FPRH1, are expressed in cAMP differentiated U937 cells and human eosinophils, while all four transcripts are expressed in human lung. This observation opens the possibility for coordinate regulation of these genes. In order to initiate the mapping of fine structure at this locus, genomic clones have been analyzed. All four of the genes have a similar structure, with the receptor protein encoded in a single exon. Detailed characterization of the C5a receptor gene reveals a two exon structure, with the 5' untranslated sequence and initiating methionine located in the first exon.

A report from the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry.,56-64,"PURPOSE: Bone marrow transplantation is an effective treatment for leukemia. Cures are possible in 20-80% of transplant recipients depending on the stage of leukemia at the time of transplant. The antileukemia efficacy of transplants result from high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation given pretransplant and from immune-mediated effects of the graft. RESULTS: Success of the procedure is limited by transplant-related complications, including graft rejection, graft-vs.-host disease and interstitial pneumonia. Five-year leukemia-free survival ranges from approximately 25% for children transplanted with advanced leukemia, to > 60% in those transplanted in first remission of acute leukemia or first chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Candidates for transplant include children failing conventional therapy and, possibly, those with early leukemia characterized by features predicting a poor response to conventional therapy.","['Horowitz, M M', 'Bortin, M M']","['Horowitz MM', 'Bortin MM']","['International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Anemia, Aplastic/surgery', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/epidemiology/etiology', 'Genetic Diseases, Inborn/surgery', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'International Cooperation', 'Leukemia/*surgery', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Nuclear Family', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/therapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199302000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1993 Feb;15(1):56-64. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199302000-00006.,['P01-CA-40053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,65,,,,

In this report, we have focused on the region of the MCF13 LTR that is 3' of the enhancer to identify binding sites for proteins that may play a role in the regulation of transcription in T cells. By gel shift and DNA footprint analyses, we have identified a single protein-binding site (MLPal) that includes a nucleotide sequence with dyad symmetry. A synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to this protein-binding site formed a specific protein-DNA complex. Deletion of this protein-binding site from the wild-type LTR decreased transcriptional activity in T lymphocytes but not in fibroblasts as determined by a transient expression assay.

Recently, it has been suggested that CAT-2 may be a receptor for amphotropic murine leukemia virus. In the present study, CAT-1 expression was observed in Hepa1, a cell line derived from a murine hepatoma, and in rat hepatocytes propagated on collagen monolayers in vitro but not in intact or regenerating rat liver in vivo. The expression of CAT-1 correlated with susceptibility to infection by an ecotropic retrovirus encoding beta-galactosidase. CAT-2 expression was observed in hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo, consistent with reports of infection of regenerating and cultured hepatocytes by amphotropic retroviruses. However, introduction of murine CAT-2 into nonpermissive Chinese hamster cells was not sufficient to confer susceptibility to amphotropic retrovirus infection, using a protocol that could easily demonstrate CAT-1-dependent infection by an ecotropic virus.

These strains were derived from crosses of AKR/J, a highly lymphomatous strain, and DBA/2J, a weakly lymphomatous strain. Of the 10 strains analyzed, nine showed a high incidence of lymphoma development. As with the other 13 AKXD strains analyzed previously (M. L. Mucenski, B. A. Taylor, N. A. Jenkins, and N. G. Copeland, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:4236-4243, 1986), the mean age at onset of lymphomas and lymphoma types varied among the strains. Whereas some strains were susceptible to T-cell lymphomas, as was the AKR/J parent, other strains were susceptible to B-cell lymphomas or to a combination of T- and B-cell lymphomas. Somatic mink cell focus-forming proviruses appeared causally associated with T-cell lymphomas, whereas somatic ecotropic proviruses appeared causally associated with B-cell lymphomas. Mice with T-cell lymphomas died significantly earlier than mice with other lymphoma types (stem, pre-B, or B cell and myeloid). The numbers of effective loci influencing the mean age at onset of lymphomas, the presence or absence of mink cell focus-forming viruses in tumors, and the frequency of T-cell lymphomas were estimated to be 3.9, 1.8, and 2.7, respectively. Tests of association with marker loci already typed in the AKXD RI strains suggested that two loci, Rmcf and Pmv-25 (or a locus linked to Pmv-25), influence all three trait variables. Finally, D21S16h, a marker locus on distal chromosome 16, showed 50% probability of linkage to a locus that influences the mean age at onset of lymphomas. Additional studies in combination with classical genetic crosses should be helpful in confirming these linkages and in identifying other loci influencing tumor susceptibility in AKXD RI strains.","['Gilbert, D J', 'Neumann, P E', 'Taylor, B A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G']","['Gilbert DJ', 'Neumann PE', 'Taylor BA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG']","['Mammalian Genetics Laboratory, ABL-Basic Research Program, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Proviruses/chemistry', 'Restriction Mapping']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.2083-2090.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):2083-90. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.2083-2090.1993.,"['CA-33093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74101/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-HD-18655/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,"['H-2', 'Rmcf']",,,,,,PMC240292,

Here we describe mapping of the BLV RNA for dimer-forming and MA(p15)-binding abilities by a simple cDNA probing method followed by mutation analyses with the reactive U5-5' gag RNA. The RNA dimerization is mediated by the region harboring U5, the primer binding site (PBS), and the 30 bases immediately downstream of PBS. This conclusion is supported by computer-assisted RNA secondary-structure analysis which predicted a multibranched stem-loop folding throughout the dimer region determined. Another region from PBS to the 5'-terminal 60 residues of the gag gene, partially overlapping the dimer region, likely provides essential elements for the MA(p15) binding reaction, although the presence of either the 3' or 5' neighboring sequences increases the complex-forming efficiency significantly, and each of the substructures predicted within the core region has, if any, only very weak affinity to MA(p15). These in vitro characterizations of the BLV RNA may reflect general features of the specific protein-RNA interaction in the packaging events of various retroviruses. 5'-terminal folded structures of retroviral RNA molecules and their biological activities are discussed.","['Katoh, I', 'Yasunaga, T', 'Yoshinaka, Y']","['Katoh I', 'Yasunaga T', 'Yoshinaka Y']","['Microbiological Research Institute, Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokushima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (matrix-associated p15, bovine leukemia virus)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA', 'Gene Products, gag/*metabolism', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Virus Replication']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.1830-1839.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):1830-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.1830-1839.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC240239,

Chicken genomic DNA was transfected into monkey COS-7 cells, and two independent primary transfectants susceptible to ALSV-A infection were identified by using ALSV-A vectors containing a hygromycin B resistance gene. A second round of transfection and selection in mouse BALB/3T3 fibroblasts again led to isolation of a transfectant susceptible to infection by ALSV-A. Plasmid DNA sequences linked to chicken DNA during the primary transfection segregated with chicken DNA in the secondary transfectant and served as a molecular tag to clone the gene conferring susceptibility. Expression of the cloned gene in mouse BALB/3T3 cells conferred susceptibility to infection by ALSV-A but not by ALSV-B. Therefore the cloned gene most probably represents the tv-a locus, the genetically defined receptor gene for ALSV-A.","['Young, J A', 'Bates, P', 'Varmus, H E']","['Young JA', 'Bates P', 'Varmus HE']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California School of Medicine, San Francisco 94143.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*pathogenicity', 'Chickens/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Mice', 'Poultry Diseases/*genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Species Specificity', 'Transfection']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.4.1811-1816.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Apr;67(4):1811-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.4.1811-1816.1993.,,,['tv-b'],,,,,,PMC240233,

In each case, the mutation results in an amino acid change in or near an ATP binding sequence of the M(r) 170,000 isozyme of topoisomerase II. We used single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis to screen for similar mutations in other drug-resistant cell lines or in leukemic cells from patients previously treated with etoposide or teniposide. We also analyzed the region of the gene that codes for amino acids adjacent to the tyrosine at position 804 of topoisomerase II which binds covalently to DNA. CEM/VM-1, CEM/VM-1-5, and HL-60/AMSA human leukemic cell lines were used as controls; 3 of 3 known mutations were detected by migration differences of polymerase chain reaction products from the RNA extracted from these three lines. A previously unknown mutation was found in the tyrosine 804 region of the M(r) 170,000 topoisomerase II expressed by CEM/VM-1 and CEM/VM-1-5 cells. Sequence analysis showed that substitution of a T for a C at nucleotide 2404 resulted in an amino acid change of a serine for a proline at amino acid 802. No mutations in any of the ATP binding sequences or in the tyrosine 804 region were detected in polymerase chain reaction products from RNA extracted from human leukemia HL-60/MX2 or CEM/MX1 cells (both cell lines selected for resistance to mitoxantrone) or in human myeloma 8226/Dox1V cells (selected for resistance by simultaneous exposure to doxorubicin and verapamil). No mutations were detected in polymerase chain reaction products from RNA extracted from blasts of 15 patients with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated with etoposide or teniposide. We conclude that: (a) single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis is useful for screening for mutations in topoisomerase II; (b) resistance to the cytotoxicity of inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II is not always associated with mutations in ATP binding sequences or the active site tyrosine region of M(r) 170,000 topoisomerase II; and (c) mutations similar to those detected in drug resistant cells selected in culture have not been identified in blast cells from patients with relapsed acute lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated with etoposide or teniposide.","['Danks, M K', 'Warmoth, M R', 'Friche, E', 'Granzen, B', 'Bugg, B Y', 'Harker, W G', 'Zwelling, L A', 'Futscher, B W', 'Suttle, D P', 'Beck, W T']","['Danks MK', 'Warmoth MR', 'Friche E', 'Granzen B', 'Bugg BY', 'Harker WG', 'Zwelling LA', 'Futscher BW', 'Suttle DP', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry/*genetics', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/analysis', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Temperature', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/genetics']",1993/03/15 00:00,1993/03/15 00:01,['1993/03/15 00:00'],"['1993/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Mar 15;53(6):1373-9.,"['CA30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47941-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47941-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, the ERR membrane protein was recently shown to function as a cation:amino acid cotransporter. A binary sequence similarity matrix and an evolutionary tree of the 14 members of this family, illustrating their sequence similarities and divergences, were constructed. Other proteins, including the developmentally controlled GerAII spore germination protein of Bacillus subtilis and the acetylcholine receptor of Drosophila melanogaster gave sequence comparison scores of a sufficiently large magnitude to suggest (but not to establish) a common evolutionary origin with members of the APC family. We report an extended and corrected Tea cDNA sequence and show that the mammalian Tea and ERR encoding genes are differentially expressed in tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, the two mammalian cDNA sequences hybridize with other vertebrate and yeast genomic DNAs under stringent conditions. These observations support the notion that cell surface receptor proteins in mammals are transport proteins that share a common origin with transport proteins of single-celled organisms. Thus, permeases of essential metabolites may function pathologically as viral receptors.","['Reizer, J', 'Finley, K', 'Kakuda, D', 'MacLeod, C L', 'Reizer, A', 'Saier, M H Jr']","['Reizer J', 'Finley K', 'Kakuda D', 'MacLeod CL', 'Reizer A', 'Saier MH Jr']","['Department of Biology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Protein Sci,Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society,9211750,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'DNA/genetics', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1993/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pro.5560020103 [doi]'],ppublish,Protein Sci. 1993 Jan;2(1):20-30. doi: 10.1002/pro.5560020103.,"['2RO1AI14176/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '5RO1AI21702/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '8RO137778/PHS HHS/United States']",,"['ERR', 'Rec-1', 'Tea']",['GENBANK/M32485'],,,,,PMC2142299,

Using a filter-binding assay, we observed a strong inhibition of DNA fragmentation induced by 3- and 24-hour continuous exposure to camptothecin, VP-16, VM-26, and m-AMSA in TPA-differentiated cells. The inhibition of the typical internucleosomal DNA fragmentation was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. By contrast, drug-induced DNA fragmentation was not inhibited in retinoic acid-differentiated cells, and apoptosis occurred in these cells after 4 to 5 days in the absence of drug treatment. The TPA inhibitory effect was maximal after 24 hours of treatment and was correlated with differentiation, because phorbol dibutyrate ester was active, whereas 4-alpha-TPA, a nontumor promoter that does not induce differentiation, was not active. Using alkaline elution, we observed that TPA and retinoic acid differentiation were associated with changes in topoisomerase-mediated DNA breaks that were not correlated with their differential effects on drug-induced DNA fragmentation. Moreover, TPA also inhibited DNA fragmentation induced by vinblastine, cycloheximide, calphostin C, and x-rays. Using a cell-free system, we observed that DNA fragmentation was not inhibited in nuclei from TPA-differentiated cells. Rather, inhibition of apoptosis seemed to take place in the cytoplasm. We conclude that phenotypic changes associated with TPA-induced differentiation include inactivation of a cytoplasmic activity that can induce DNA fragmentation associated with apoptosis.","['Solary, E', 'Bertrand, R', 'Kohn, K W', 'Pommier, Y']","['Solary E', 'Bertrand R', 'Kohn KW', 'Pommier Y']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85473-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Mar 1;81(5):1359-68.,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-seven patients were treated, including 17 patients with acute myelogenous or undifferentiated leukemia, 7 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and 3 with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase. Severe mucositis was the dose-limiting toxicity occurring in two of five patients treated with Topotecan 11.8 mg/m2 per course; a third patient had prolonged myelosuppression. At the MTD of 10 mg/m2 per course, 1 of 12 patients had severe mucositis and 5 had mild-to-moderate mucositis. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and prolonged myelosuppression were uncommon. Three patients (11%) achieved a complete response, two (7%) had a partial response, and one (4%) had a hematologic improvement. The overall complete plus partial response rate was 19%, and 24% in acute myelogenous or undifferentiated leukemia. A novel in vitro assay that quantifies Topotecan-stabilized topo I-DNA complexes in patient samples was used, which demonstrated heterogeneity in the ability of Topotecan to interact with topo I, the intracellular target of Topotecan. This phase I study defined the MTD of Topotecan to be 10 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia.

""Lymphocyte spillover"" from the thymus into the peripheral blood as well as a second, associated neoplasm (ie, T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) are two hypotheses that have been proposed to explain this clinical phenomenon. We describe another patient with a lymphocyte-rich malignant thymoma associated with peripheral T-cell lymphocytosis. At the time of initial diagnosis, the patient's complete blood cell count was unremarkable. However, subsequent to the development of pulmonary metastases, the patient developed persistent lymphocytosis. The total leukocyte count ranged from 20 to 30 x 10(9)/L, 80% of these cells being lymphocytes. Immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood specimens from this patient proved that the circulating cells were mature, polyclonal T cells. The cells expressed the alpha/beta T-cell receptor and the pan-T-cell antigens CD2, CD3, CD5, and CD7, and were negative for both terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and the CD1 antigen. A mixture of T-helper (CD4+) and T-suppressor (CD8+) cells were present in a ratio of 1:1.6. Gene rearrangement studies revealed that the T-cell receptor beta chain and the immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes were in the germline configuration. Serum samples from this patient were also analyzed for thymic hormones; the level of thymosin alpha 1 was markedly elevated, while that of thymosin beta 4 was decreased. These results effectively exclude the hypothesis that the lymphocytosis represents a second, associated neoplasm. The lymphocyte spillover hypothesis also seems unlikely (although not excluded), since the lymphocytes in lymphocyte-rich thymomas usually have an immature thymic cortical immunophenotype. Furthermore, one might expect nonspecific elevation of all thymic hormone levels with lymphocyte spillover. Thus, we suggest that the lymphocytosis results from a poorly defined immunoregulatory disorder, related to the presence of thymoma, and perhaps secondary thymic hormone imbalance.","['Medeiros, L J', 'Bhagat, S K', 'Naylor, P', 'Fowler, D', 'Jaffe, E S', 'Stetler-Stevenson, M']","['Medeiros LJ', 'Bhagat SK', 'Naylor P', 'Fowler D', 'Jaffe ES', 'Stetler-Stevenson M']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md 20892.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Thymus Hormones)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphocytosis/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Thymus Hormones/blood', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1993 Mar;117(3):279-83.,,['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 1994 Dec;118(12):1170-1.

To explore the functional significance of this region and to identify critical residues, we introduced several amino acid substitutions and examined their effects on erythropoietin-induced mitogenesis, tyrosine phosphorylation, and expression of immediate-early (c-fos, c-myc, and egr-1) and early (ornithine decarboxylase and T-cell receptor gamma) genes in interleukin-3-dependent cell lines. Amino acid substitution of W-282, which is strictly conserved at the middle portion of the homology region, completely abolished all the functions of the EpoR. Point mutation at L-306 or E-307, both of which are in a conserved LEVL motif, drastically impaired the function of the receptor in all assays. Other point mutations, introduced into less conserved amino acid residues, did not significantly impair the function of the receptor. These results demonstrate that conserved amino acid residues in this domain of the EpoR are required for mitogenesis, stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation, and induction of immediate-early and early genes.","['Miura, O', 'Cleveland, J L', 'Ihle, J N']","['Miura O', 'Cleveland JL', 'Ihle JN']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 31051.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cytokines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.3.1788-1795.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Mar;13(3):1788-95. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.3.1788-1795.1993.,"['DK42932/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK44159/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC359491,

During the course of infection with either of the molecularly cloned viruses pNE-8 or ts-1, we observed that ts-1 spread twice as rapidly as pNE-8, and ascended higher in the neuraxis. Endothelial cells were infected first, followed by oligodendrocytes and neurons, while astrocytes containing glial fibrillary acidic protein were not infected. Additionally, ts-1 also infected macrophages/microglia. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I beta 2-microglobulin expression was minimal in pNE-8 infected mice, while it was elevated in endothelial cells of early ts-1 lesions, and in macrophages/microglia during later stages. Occasional infected cells expressed beta 2-microglobulin while rare endothelial and parenchymal cells expressed MHC class II in both viral infections. Limited intra-CNS MHC expression may be one of the mechanisms of viral persistence and will present a barrier to developing immunotherapy for CNS retroviral infections. The few mice that escaped lethal infection had higher serum titers of neutralizing antibodies and showed no neuropathologic changes or detectable virus in the CNS. Higher titers of neutralizing antibodies may protect the CNS from infection.","['Nagra, R M', 'Wong, P K', 'Wiley, C A']","['Nagra RM', 'Wong PK', 'Wiley CA']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antibodies, Viral/biosynthesis/*blood', 'Brain/immunology/*pathology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Encephalitis/immunology/*pathology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, MHC Class II', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/microbiology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/*pathology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/biosynthesis/genetics']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00005072-199303000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 1993 Mar;52(2):163-73. doi: 10.1097/00005072-199303000-00009.,['NS-27417/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Deletion mutants of the SV40 enhancer showed that a similar set of motifs is critical for CAT expression at all stages of F9 differentiation, but differentiation dependency was observed even in their absence. The stability of transient gene expression under the control of the SV40 promoter was markedly dependent on F9 differentiation. Appreciable expression was detected even in undifferentiated F9 cells immediately after gene transfection, was maximal at 12 h and declined rapidly thereafter. On the other hand, expression in primitive endoderm increased until 72 h. The decline was accelerated again in visceral endoderm. This shift was somewhat specific to the virus promoter since CAT expression in undifferentiated F9 cells under the control of the elongation factor 1 alpha promoter was more stable than for virus promoters tested.

We have investigated the possibility that this effect is due to modulation of the Ca2+ response in mast cells and in particular that tenidap might be an inhibitor of the Ca2+ influx pathway or channel in these and other non-excitable cells. Tenidap inhibited the antigen-induced increase in intracellular Ca2+ measured both in cell suspensions and at the single cell level using digital imaging of Fura-2 fluorescence. Tenidap also inhibited both antigen- and thapsigargin-induced 45Ca influx across the plasma membrane at concentrations similar to those required for the inhibition of secretion. Somewhat unexpectedly, the compound itself caused some release of calcium from intracellular stores; however, this effect did not appear to be related to the inhibition of calcium influx or secretion. In mouse pituitary tumour (AtT-20) cells, tenidap inhibited depolarization-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+ suggesting that this compound also inhibits Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels.

Isolation, purification, and chromatographic analysis of the mitochondrial components complexed with [3H(G)]DAU revealed that one of the major components involved is cytochrome c oxidase (COX). Both DAU and ADR caused a dose-dependent inhibition of COX activity in vitro, an event prevented by exogenous hemin. The interaction of DAU with COX appears to occur via more than one site, one of which at least appears to be the prosthetic group of heme.

CEM/VP-1 cells exhibit an 'atypical MDR' phenotype: cross resistance to other topo II inhibitors (but not Vinca alkaloids) and expression of a drug-resistant topo II activity. Cytogenetic and molecular studies revealed that the cell line carried multiple genetic changes affecting TOP2 genes encoding both topo II alpha and beta isoforms. CEM/VP-1 was diploid, 47,XX,+20, and appears to have been preferentially selected from a 1% diploid subpopulation present in the tetraploid parental cells. The same chromosomal abnormalities were present in resistant and sensitive cells except for an acquired 3p- change most likely deleting one TOP2 beta allele. PCR/DNA sequence analysis and allele-specific hybridisation showed that one of two TOP2 alpha alleles expressed in CEM/VP-1 cells had acquired a Lys-797-->Asn codon change. This mutation lies close to the catalytic Tyr-804 residue of the protein and may interfere with drug-induced trapping of the cleavable complex. Alternatively, it could exert a loss of function phenotype. CEM/VP-1 cells did not exhibit codon 449 or 486 TOP2 alpha mutations in the ATP binding domain reported in two other resistant cell lines. Diploid selection and multiple changes observed in CEM/VP-1 cells appear to be consequences of the recessive phenotype of at-MDR. These results may be useful in approaching the mechanisms of clinical resistance.","['Patel, S', 'Fisher, L M']","['Patel S', 'Fisher LM']","[""Department of Cellular and Molecular Sciences, St George's Hospital Medical School, University of London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1993.87 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1993 Mar;67(3):456-63. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1993.87.,,,"['TOP2&Agr;', 'TOP2&Bgr;']",,,,,,PMC1968246,

An mRNA for ACE was detected and characterized after reverse transcription and amplification by PCR in T-lymphocytes and several T-cell leukaemia cell lines. We have previously observed that the interindividual variability in the levels of ACE in plasma is, in part, genetically determined and influenced by an insertion/deletion polymorphism of the ACE gene. To investigate the mechanisms involved in the regulation of ACE biosynthesis, the ACE levels of T-lymphocytes from 35 healthy subjects having different ACE genotypes were studied. These levels varied widely between individuals but were highly reproducible and influenced by the polymorphism of the ACE gene. T-lymphocyte levels of ACE were significantly higher in subjects who were homozygote for the deletion than in the other subjects.

Alignment of the pSR3 sequence with the partial nucleotide sequence of Emv-11 (an endogenous virus carried by BALB/c and C3H/He mice) together with p623 then allows a comparison between three viral sequences. Analysis of these data gives (a) an estimation of the natural divergence rate of MuLV genomes in the course of viral replication (1-5 x 10(-5) mutations per cycle and per nucleotide) and (b) molecular evidence for a recent origin through germ line infection of endogenous loci.

It offers a comprehensive model to study at a molecular level the contributions of the viral oncogenes to neoplastic transformation in vitro and in the animal. We have investigated the ability of HaPV large T antigen to form a complex with the product of the retinoblastoma gene (pRb) in vitro. In this report, we demonstrate that HaPV large T antigen can indeed complex the pRb polypeptide. In order to investigate to what extent this interaction might contribute to tumor induction by the virus, we have introduced two different point mutations within the putative pRb-binding sequence of large T antigen, and as a preliminary to in vivo experiments we have studied their effects in vitro on some biological activities relevant to tumor induction. We show that the substitution (Glu-134-->Lys) obliterates pRb binding, suggesting that Glu-134 participates in the interaction between pRb and large T antigen, whereas the substitution (Glu-135-->Lys) has no effect. The Lys-134 mutation is strongly deleterious to the immortalization capacity of the viral genome, whereas the Lys-135 mutation has no effect. Neither of the two mutations affects the capacity of the viral genome to induce foci formation in the rat established cell line F111. These results indicate that the interaction between large T and pRb is required in the immortalization process but irrelevant to transformation. Both mutants show at least partial impairment of replication and productive cycle.","['Goutebroze, L', 'de la Roche Saint Andre, C', 'Scherneck, S', 'Feunteun, J']","['Goutebroze L', 'de la Roche Saint Andre C', 'Scherneck S', 'Feunteun J']","[""Laboratoire d'Oncologie Moleculaire CNRS/URA1158, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/genetics/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cricetinae', 'Mesocricetus', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Polyomavirus/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', '*Virus Replication']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Mar;8(3):685-93.,,,,,,,,,,

The tax protein is the product of the transactivator gene and has been shown to up-regulate the expression of some cellular genes controlling T-cell replication, including that of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) T-cell growth hormone and the alpha chain of its receptor (IL-2R). Several studies have shown that tax transactivation of the IL-2R alpha-chain promoter is mediated by binding sites for the transcriptional activator NF-kappa B, and this mechanism has also been implicated in the tax activation of IL-2 promoter activity. The rex gene product of HTLV-I regulates viral protein production by influencing mRNA expression and has been implicated in the stabilization of IL-2R alpha-chain mRNA. In the present studies, the ability of the tax and rex proteins to transactivate IL-2 gene expression has been reinvestigated. The ability of the tax protein to transactivate IL-2 promoter activity appears, at least in part, to be mediated by the recognition sequence for a DNA-binding complex known as CD28RC. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that tax-mediated activation of IL-2 gene expression is resistant to the immunosuppressive affects of cyclosporin A, a property postulated for the CD28RC binding complex. Unexpectedly, this tax-mediated up-regulation of IL-2 expression is synergized by the presence of the rex protein. These findings demonstrate that transactivation of IL-2 gene expression by tax is augmented by mechanisms distinct from NF-kappa B and raise the possibility that rex, as well as tax, contributes to the oncogenic capability of HTLV-I by altering the expression of the IL-2 gene in T cells infected with this retrovirus.","['McGuire, K L', 'Curtiss, V E', 'Larson, E L', 'Haseltine, W A']","['McGuire KL', 'Curtiss VE', 'Larson EL', 'Haseltine WA']","['Department of Biology and Molecular Biology Institute, College of Sciences, San Diego State University, California 92182-0057.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Base Sequence', 'CD28 Antigens', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Genes, pX/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Cell Surface', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Up-Regulation']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.3.1590-1599.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Mar;67(3):1590-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.3.1590-1599.1993.,['CA53382-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['rex', 'tax']",,,,,,PMC237530,

Recently, we have cloned a human gene (H13) homologous to the murine ecotropic retroviral receptor (ERR). Although the human homolog is very similar to murine ERR in sequence (87.6% amino acid identity) and structure (14 transmembrane-spanning domains), the human protein fails to function as a receptor for MuLV-E. To identify amino acid residues critical for MuLV-E infection, we took advantage of this species difference and substituted human H13 and murine ERR amino acid residues. Mouse-human chimeric receptor molecules were generated by taking advantage of using common restriction sites. These studies demonstrated that extracellular domains 3 and/or 4 contain the critical amino acid residues. Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was then used to create 13 individual ERR mutants containing one or two amino acids substitutions or insertions within these two extracellular domains. Substitution of as few as one amino acid residue (Tyr) at position 235 in ERR with the corresponding H13 amino acid residue Pro abrogates the ability to function as a receptor for MuLV-E infection. Conversely, substitution of just two amino acid residues at positions 240 and 242 or 242 and 244 in H13 with the corresponding amino acid residues in ERR endows H13 with the ability to function as the receptor. This observation can be utilized to significantly improve the safety of retrovirus-mediated gene therapy in humans.","['Yoshimoto, T', 'Yoshimoto, E', 'Meruelo, D']","['Yoshimoto T', 'Yoshimoto E', 'Meruelo D']","['Department of Pathology, New York University Medical Center, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.3.1310-1314.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Mar;67(3):1310-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.3.1310-1314.1993.,"['CA22247/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35482/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['ERR', 'H13']",,,,,,PMC237498,

These lines were derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Z-6), myelodysplastic syndrome (Z-43), and acute myelogenous leukemia (Z-55) patients who had a prior EBV infection. Each lymphoblastoid cell line had a karyotype that was different from that of the original parent leukemic cells, and all expressed B cell, but not T cell or myeloid surface markers. In all three lines, rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region (JH) bands were found, and the presence of EBV DNA was confirmed by Southern blotting. Z-6, Z-43, and Z-55 cell lines constitutively produced 192, 48, and 78 U/ml LT, respectively, as assessed by a cytotoxicity assay and antibody neutralization. Levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were undetectable. Scatchard analysis revealed that all the cell lines expressed high-affinity TNF/LT receptors with receptor densities of 4197, 1258, and 1209 sites/cell on Z-6, Z-43, and Z-55, respectively. Furthermore, labeled TNF binding could be reversed by both unlabeled TNF, as well as by LT. Studies with p60 and p80 receptor-specific antibodies revealed that the three lines expressed primarily the p80 form of the TNF receptor. When studied in a clonogenic assay, exogenous LT stimulated proliferation of all three cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion at concentrations ranging from 25 to 500 U/ml. Similar results were obtained with [3H]TdR incorporation. Monoclonal anti-LT neutralizing antibodies at concentrations of 25-500 U/ml inhibited cellular multiplication in a dose-dependent manner. It is interesting that in spite of a common receptor, TNF (1,000 U/ml) had no direct effect on Z-55 cell growth, whereas it partially reversed the stimulatory effect of exogenous LT. In addition, TNF inhibited Z-6 and Z-43 cell proliferation, and its suppressive effect was reversed by exogenous LT. Both p80 and p60 forms of soluble TNF receptors suppressed the lymphoblastoid cell line proliferation and their inhibitory effect was partially reversed by LT. Our data suggest that (a) LT is an autocrine growth factor for EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid B cell lines; and (b) anti-LT antibodies, soluble TNF/LT receptors, and TNF itself can suppress the growth of lymphoblastoid cells, probably by modulating or competing with LT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Estrov, Z', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Pocsik, E', 'Pathak, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Zipf, T F', 'Harris, D', 'Talpaz, M', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Estrov Z', 'Kurzrock R', 'Pocsik E', 'Pathak S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Zipf TF', 'Harris D', 'Talpaz M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*microbiology/*pathology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/analysis/genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Growth Substances/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*pathology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*analysis/metabolism/physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/analysis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/metabolism/pharmacology']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.177.3.763 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Mar 1;177(3):763-74. doi: 10.1084/jem.177.3.763.,,,,,,,,,PMC2190931,

All B6 mice died by 20 wk after LP-BM5 MuLV inoculation. In marked contrast, xid mice have continued to survive without any sign of MAIDS-related symptoms till at least 20 wk after the inoculation. The delayed progression of MAIDS in xid mice appears to depend on xid mutation, according to our experiments using both sexes of (B6.xid x B6)F1 and (B6 x B6.xid)F1 mice. Furthermore, Ly-1 B cells, enriched by a FACS, were shown to integrate the defective genome and appeared to be a major virus-infected B cell population.

Isolated plasma membranes from DMSO-M and RA-differentiated (RA-M) cells were used to examine receptor and guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G protein) expression. Ligand binding showed that formyl peptide and leukotriene B4 receptors were present in equal density on DMSO-M and RA-M. Formyl peptide receptors on RA-M failed to demonstrate high affinity binding sites. Both G alpha i2 and G alpha i3 were present in equal density on RA-M and DMSO-M by immunoblotting. FMLP, but not leukotriene B4, failed to stimulate guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate binding or GTP hydrolysis and guanine nucleotides failed to inhibit FMLP binding to RA-M. Addition of solubilized membranes containing normal formyl peptide receptors to solubilized RA-M reconstituted FMLP stimulated G protein activation, whereas addition of normal G proteins had no effect. We conclude that formyl peptide, but not leukotriene B4, receptors are uncoupled from G proteins in RA-differentiated HL-60 granulocytes. Although RA-differentiated cells are an inadequate model of neutrophil transmembrane signaling, they may provide a unique model by which to study the molecular requirements for formyl peptide receptor-G protein interactions.","['Erbeck, K', 'Klein, J B', 'McLeish, K R']","['Erbeck K', 'Klein JB', 'McLeish KR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, KY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/03/01 00:00,1993/03/01 00:01,['1993/03/01 00:00'],"['1993/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Mar 1;150(5):1913-21.,,,,,,,,,,

The study was designed to determine the incidence of hypercalcemia in patients with cancer. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was done of laboratory data from 7667 patients registered at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center for the first time during 1989 for whom serum calcium levels were determined during the first 2 months after registration. RESULTS: Severe hypercalcemia (serum calcium level of more than 12.0 mg/100 ml) was present in 40 patients (0.52%); it occurred most often in patients with renal cell cancer (1.42%) and non-small cell lung cancer (1.03%). Less frequent diagnoses were multiple myeloma (0.79%), leukemia (0.63%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.26%), and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract (0.20%). Moderate hypercalcemia (calcium levels of 10.8-12.0 mg/100 ml) was present in 48 patients (0.63%); it occurred most often in patients with renal cell cancer (3.30%) and multiple myeloma (2.38%). Less frequent diagnoses were non-small cell lung cancer (0.89%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.79%), leukemia (0.63%), and cancer of the gastrointestinal tract (0.51%). The presence of hypercalcemia was associated with increased frequency of distant metastases, bone metastases, and increased mortality consistent with other studies of the prognostic effect of this complication.

Like a host of other antineoplastic intercalating agents, IDA produced this effect to a much lesser extent in HL-60/AMSA cells, a line that is primarily resistant to the intercalator amsacrine, but is cross-resistant to a variety of topoisomerase II-reactive DNA intercalating agents including IDA. This resistance is thought to be secondary to the resistance of the topoisomerase II within HL-60/AMSA cells. Surprisingly, HL-60/AMSA cells were minimally resistant to the cytotoxic and DNA cleaving actions of another anthracycline, doxorubicin (ADR). Comparing other effects of the two anthracyclines revealed that IDA, but not ADR, produced endonucleolytic cleavage, a marker of apoptosis. These results suggest that DNA intercalating anthracyclines can have different effects in human leukemia cells. In the case of IDA, drug actions were similar to those produced by the majority of intercalating agents examined in this cellular system. In the case of ADR, the ability to circumvent the resistance of HL-60/AMSA suggests additional, non-topoisomerase II-mediated mechanisms of cytolysis that may also explain the broad spectrum of clinical activity of ADR.","['Zwelling, L A', 'Bales, E', 'Altschuler, E', 'Mayes, J']","['Zwelling LA', 'Bales E', 'Altschuler E', 'Mayes J']","['University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*pharmacology', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/26 00:00,1993/01/26 00:01,['1993/01/26 00:00'],"['1993/01/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/26 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90091-A [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90091-a [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Jan 26;45(2):516-20. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90091-a.,['CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Low concentrations of Ins(2,4,5)P3, causing rapid discharge of a small proportion of the releasable Ca2+, result in a substantial stimulation of Ca2+ efflux after thapsigargin addition. This indicates firstly that in the absence of thapsigargin there must have been a substantial, counterbalancing, increase in rate of Ca2+ pumping, and secondly that the increased Ca2+ permeability is more consistent with a steady state than with a quantal model of Ca2+ release. Similar increases in passive Ca2+ permeability are produced by addition of concentrations of ionomycin which produce equivalent changes in Ca2+ loading to those produced by Ins(2,4,5)P3, although the time course and initial rate of Ca2+ release are very much slower. In the presence of a Ca(2+)-buffering system, the time course of Ca2+ release by Ins(2,4,5)P3 becomes superimposable on that of ionomycin, indicating that the initial rapid phase of Ins(2,4,5)P3-stimulated Ca2+ is at least partially due to positive feedback from extravesicular Ca2+.","['Loomis-Husselbee, J W', 'Dawson, A P']","['Loomis-Husselbee JW', 'Dawson AP']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Buffers)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Terpenes)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '23D4W0B50Y (Fluo-3)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', '91840-07-2 (inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Buffers', 'Calcium/*pharmacokinetics', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Fluorometry', 'Inositol Phosphates/*pharmacology', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Thapsigargin', 'Xanthenes']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2890861 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Feb 1;289 ( Pt 3):861-6. doi: 10.1042/bj2890861.,,,,,,,,,PMC1132255,

Cytochrome P-450 inhibitors blocked the agonist-induced entry of Ca2+ or Mn2+ with no modification of Ca2+ release from the stores. Emptying the intracellular Ca2+ stores either by treatments inducing no inositol phosphate production, such as prolonged incubation in Ca(2+)-free medium or treatment with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin, increased the plasma-membrane permeability to Ca2+ and Mn2+. This Ca(2+)-store-regulated Mn2+ entry was inhibited by Ni2+ and by cytochrome P-450 inhibitors. Refilling of the Ca2+ stores by incubation in Ca(2+)-containing medium restored low Mn2+ permeability. The same mechanism is present and functional in non-differentiated cells, before expression of membrane receptors for fMLP and PAF.

Scatchard analysis of [3H]LTB4 specific binding to THP-1 cell membranes revealed a single population of high affinity (KD = 56 pM) and saturable (2000 receptors/cell) binding sites. [3H]LTB4 specific binding was enhanced by divalent cations, but inhibited by both monovalent cations and a non-hydrolysable GTP analogue. Treatment with GTP analogue resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in the number of high affinity binding sites, accompanied by the appearance of an equal number of binding sites of lower affinity (KD = 1250 pM). In contrast, Scatchard analysis with human polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) membranes consistently revealed two populations of LTB4 receptors (KD = 48 pM and 270 pM). Treatment with GTP analogue, however, converted all these detectable binding sites to the lower affinity state. These data suggest that the LTB4 receptor in both THP-1 cell and PMN membranes exists in interconverting affinity states modulated by G-protein coupling. The similarity between the LTB4 receptors present in these two cell types was also substantiated by target-size analysis by radiation inactivation, which estimated a comparable molecular mass of 56.5 kDa and 52.8 kDa for the THP-1 cell and PMN LTB4 receptors, respectively. Finally, the presence of a single LTB4 receptor in PMN was demonstrated by direct photolabelling. Irradiation of frozen [3H]LTB4 equilibrium binding assay incubations resulted in complete photolysis of [3H]LTB4. Subsequent resolution of the tritiated PMN proteins by sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed one major radioactive peak migrating with an apparent molecular weight of 61,000. This peak was identified as the LTB4 receptor since radiolabelling could be completely inhibited by the presence of excess unlabelled LTB4 or the LTB4-receptor antagonist, L-662,328. Photolabelling was also partially inhibited by pretreatment with GTP analogue, consistent with G-protein uncoupling reagents reducing receptor affinity without complete inhibition. In summary, the LTB4 receptor identified in human myeloid cells is a G-protein coupled receptor with interconvertible high and low affinity states, having a molecular mass of 53-61 kDa.","['Slipetz, D M', 'Scoggan, K A', 'Nicholson, D W', 'Metters, K M']","['Slipetz DM', 'Scoggan KA', 'Nicholson DW', 'Metters KM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research, Dorval, Que., Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Cations/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gamma Rays', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/metabolism', 'Photochemistry', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Immunologic/chemistry/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0922-4106(93)90022-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 1993 Jan 15;244(2):161-73. doi: 10.1016/0922-4106(93)90022-2.,,,,,,,,,,

The standard deviation of DELTA values was found to be lower for DACA than for the other topoisomerase II-directed drugs amsacrine, etoposide, doxorubicin and mitozantrone in both the cell lines and the primary cultures. These lower standard deviations appear to have resulted from the reduced susceptibility of DACA to both P-glycoprotein- and topoisomerase II-mediated multidrug-resistance mechanisms occurring naturally in cell lines and primary cultures.","['Finlay, G J', 'Marshall, E', 'Matthews, J H', 'Paull, K D', 'Baguley, B C']","['Finlay GJ', 'Marshall E', 'Matthews JH', 'Paull KD', 'Baguley BC']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Auckland School of Medicine, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Acridines)', '0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Intercalating Agents)', ""89459-25-6 (N-(2'-(dimethylamino)ethyl)acridine-4-carboxamide)"", 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)']",IM,"['*Acridines', 'Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Intercalating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686155 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1993;31(5):401-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00686155.,,,,,,,,,,

Magnetic resonance (MR) methods use the signals of the protons of water and lipids. This paper gives a comparison between different standard MR techniques and recently developed fat- and water-selective imaging methods, addressing their sensitivity to bone marrow changes in leukemia. Additionally, 1H results of spectroscopic methods are presented. The results and conclusions are based on the examination of 26 healthy volunteers and 106 patients with general or focal bone marrow alterations. Standard T1-weighted images did not distinguish bone marrow of young healthy volunteers with relatively high cellularity from acute leukemia. Using fat- and water-selective methods, patients with untreated leukemia showed only water proton signals and no lipid signals from red bone marrow of vertebral bodies and the pelvis. This phenomenon was never observed in healthy volunteers. Following chemotherapy, lipid and water contents normalize in successfully treated patients. Nonresponders did not show significant changes of the fat-water ratio after up to 3 weeks of therapy. Phase contrast imaging provides information about the difference between fat and water fractions within the bone marrow, but quantitative determination of the absolute fat and water fractions requires acquisition of several images and suffers from the susceptibility effects in trabecular bone marrow. The fat-water ratio and additional qualities of water and lipid protons (relaxation times) can be evaluated by volume-selective MR spectroscopy. Typical results of spectra from small-volume elements in hypercellular vertebral bone marrow of leukemic patients before cytotoxic treatment and of normocellular or hypocellular marrow after therapy are demonstrated.","['Schick, F', 'Einsele, H', 'Bongers, H', 'Jung, W I', 'Skalej, M', 'Duda, S', 'Ehninger, G', 'Lutz, O']","['Schick F', 'Einsele H', 'Bongers H', 'Jung WI', 'Skalej M', 'Duda S', 'Ehninger G', 'Lutz O']","['Department of Diagnostic Radiology, University of Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Contrast Media)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Protons)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/chemistry/*pathology', 'Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lipids/analysis', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protons', 'Spectrum Analysis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01737683 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1993 Jan;66(1):3-13. doi: 10.1007/BF01737683.,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of HIV-1 protease inhibitors to suppress replication of the C-type retrovirus Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV) and the HIV-related lentivirus simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) was examined in plaque reduction assays and syncytium reduction assays, respectively. Three of seven compounds examined blocked production of infectious R-MuLV, with 50% inhibitory concentrations of < or = 1 microM. Little or no cellular cytotoxicity was detectable at concentrations up to 100 microM. The same compounds which inhibited the infectivity of HIV-1 also produced activity against SIV and R-MuLV. Electron microscopic examination revealed the presence of many virions with atypical morphologies in cultures treated with the active compounds. Morphometric analysis demonstrated that the active compounds reduced the number of membrane-associated virus particles. These results demonstrate that synthetic peptide analog inhibitors of retroviral proteases significantly inhibit proteolytic processing of the gag polyproteins of R-MuLV and SIV and inhibit the replication of these retroviruses. These results are similar to those for inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity by these compounds, and thus, R-MuLV and SIV might be suitable models for the in vivo evaluation of the antiretroviral activities of these protease inhibitors.","['Black, P L', 'Downs, M B', 'Lewis, M G', 'Ussery, M A', 'Dreyer, G B', 'Petteway, S R Jr', 'Lambert, D M']","['Black PL', 'Downs MB', 'Lewis MG', 'Ussery MA', 'Dreyer GB', 'Petteway SR Jr', 'Lambert DM']","['Southern Research Institute-Frederick Research Center, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*drug effects', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*drug effects', 'Viral Plaque Assay', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism']",1993/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/AAC.37.1.71 [doi]'],ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1993 Jan;37(1):71-7. doi: 10.1128/AAC.37.1.71.,['1U01A125617/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC187607,

Exocytosis, nevertheless, was still dependent on an elevated free Ca2+. (Ozawa, K., Szallasi, Z., Kazanietz, M. G., Blumberg, P. M., Mischak, H., Mushinski, J. F., and Beaven, M. A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 1749-1756). We now demonstrate that PKC alpha and epsilon, exclusively, inhibit antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids in the same permeabilized RBL-2H3 cells. Unlike secretion, the inhibitory actions occurred at a basal concentration (0.1 microM) of free Ca2+. The inhibitory actions of the two isozymes were potentiated by 20 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. As indicated by the effects of the phorbol ester, the probable mechanism was reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma 1. The negative regulation of phospholipase C was apparent in intact cells, because the PKC inhibitor Ro31-7549 or down-regulation of PKC with phorbol ester enhanced antigen-induced hydrolysis of inositol phospholipids. The concentrations of the various isozymes of PKC in RBL-2H3 cells, as estimated by immunoblotting studies, were sufficient for promotion of exocytosis (i.e. beta and delta) and inhibition of phospholipid hydrolysis (i.e. alpha and epsilon).","['Ozawa, K', 'Yamada, K', 'Kazanietz, M G', 'Blumberg, P M', 'Beaven, M A']","['Ozawa K', 'Yamada K', 'Kazanietz MG', 'Blumberg PM', 'Beaven MA']","['Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'Y6197FQK8I (Ro 31-7549)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/administration & dosage', 'Basophils/*enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Exocytosis', 'Feedback', 'Immunoglobulin E/physiology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1993/02/05 00:00,1993/02/05 00:01,['1993/02/05 00:00'],"['1993/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)53768-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Feb 5;268(4):2280-3.,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of marrow with MC540, followed by illumination with visible light, selectively kills neoplastic cells while sparing a sufficient number of stem cells to allow marrow engraftment. The photodynamic action of MC540 is thought to be mediated by reactive oxygen species, particularly singlet oxygen. We have previously shown that salicylic acid (SA) scavenges MC540-generated singlet oxygen. In this work, we sought to abrogate MC540-mediated cell killing of murine L1210 and human K562 leukemia cells with salicylate. Paradoxically, the presence of salicylate during illumination in the presence of MC540 appreciably enhanced cell killing. Enhancement was dependent on salicylate concentration in the range 0.1 to 10 mM, with 1.0 mM SA potentiating the MC540-mediated reduction in survival of L1210 and K562 cells by factors of 2.7 and 1.9, respectively. Neither preincubation with SA followed by washing prior to illumination nor addition of SA following illumination altered MC540-mediated cell killing, indicating that potentiation was dependent on the presence of SA during illumination. Illumination in the presence of salicylate alone did not diminish cell viability. In addition to SA, a number of structurally related compounds including dihydroxybenzoic acids, aspirin, and sodium benzoate also enhanced MC540-mediated cell killing. Potentiation of leukemic cell killing by salicylate could provide a basis for enhancing the clinical efficacy of MC540-mediated phototherapy.","['Anderson, M S', 'Kalyanaraman, B', 'Feix, J B']","['Anderson MS', 'Kalyanaraman B', 'Feix JB']","['Department of Radiology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Gentisates)', '0 (Hydroxides)', '0 (Hydroxybenzoates)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Pyrimidinones)', '0 (Salicylates)', '3352-57-6 (Hydroxyl Radical)', '58823-12-4 (merocyanine dye)', 'O414PZ4LPZ (Salicylic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'VP36V95O3T (2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', '*Gentisates', 'Humans', 'Hydroxides/metabolism', 'Hydroxybenzoates/therapeutic use', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Oxygen/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidinones/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylates/*therapeutic use', 'Salicylic Acid']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Feb 15;53(4):806-9.,"['CA49089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR01008/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This regulatory element increases the expression of a linked alpha-globin gene in mouse erythroleukemia cells and in transgenic mice. This element has been shown to share many of the structural and functional features of the locus control region (LCR) of the beta-globin gene cluster. We have examined the activity of a small fragment from this regulatory domain (alpha LCR) in a transient expression system. We show that this element is active as an enhancer in the erythroid environment of K562 cells. It is somewhat less effective as an enhancer in the nonerythroid environment of HeLa cells. This alpha LCR fragment does not exhibit promoter specificity because it can activate both the promoter of its endogenous target gene and the heterologous promoter of the SV40 early genes. Although the major activity of this element is mediated by its interaction with the promoter of the alpha-globin gene, some increase in activity is seen when structural elements from the 5' end of the alpha-globin gene are included with the target promoter. In addition, we show that the enhancing activity of the alpha LCR is potentiated by hemin-induction of K562 cells. Whereas phorbol esters that induce megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells markedly decrease alpha-globin messenger RNA accumulation, they do not seem to have a negative effect on the activity of the alpha LCR. These studies suggest a role for the alpha LCR in the basal activity of the alpha-globin gene in erythroid cells and in its increased expression seen with erythroid differentiation. The mechanism of negative regulation of alpha-globin gene expression in phorbol-differentiated K562 cells does not appear to be mediated through the action of the alpha LCR.","['Ren, S', 'Luo, X N', 'Atweh, G F']","['Ren S', 'Luo XN', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Medicine, State University of New York Health Science Center, Brooklyn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Hemin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Simian virus 40/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1993/02/15 00:00,1993/02/15 00:01,['1993/02/15 00:00'],"['1993/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85129-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Feb 15;81(4):1058-66.,"['HL-16008/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In contrast to typical CD4+ATL cells, DN-ATL cells were shown to express the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) for S100 beta in immunocytochemical assay and the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assay. The mean fluorescence intensity of the TCR/CD3 complex was extremely low in all four DN-ATL patients as well as in typical CD4+ ATL. All four patients had TCR beta and gamma chain gene rearrangements, with deletion of TCR delta chain gene and mRNA expression for TCR alpha, beta, and CD3 delta but not for TCR gamma and delta chain genes. Thus, CD4- CD8- TCR alpha beta T cells are also a target for human T-cell lymphotrophic virus type I-induced leukemogenesis. In addition, expression of the TCR alpha beta/CD3 complex on the DN-ATL cells was further diminished by the addition of anti-CD3 or anti-TCR alpha beta monoclonal antibody.

To investigate the distribution and the functional role of these receptors on leukemic B cells from hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patients, we evaluated: (1) the cytofluorimetric pattern of uncultured and cultured leukemic B cells incubated with utr-1 and htr-9 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), which specifically recognize the 75-Kd and 55-Kd TNF receptors (TNFR), respectively; (2) the effect of TNF-alpha and TNF-beta on leukemic B cells in an in vitro proliferation assay; (3) the role of anti-TNFR MoAbs on TNF-alpha and TNF-beta-driven B-cell growth; and (4) the proliferative effect of utr-1 and htr-9 MoAbs on in vitro cultured leukemic cells.

The expression of these receptors was neither upregulated nor downregulated by different stimuli, including TNF-alpha, TNF-beta, B-cell growth factor, and interleukin-2. TNF-alpha efficiently triggers the proliferation of HC and, to a lesser extent, the growth of B-CLL cells. TNF-beta was also able to transduce the proliferative signal in HCL, but not in B-CLL patients. TNF-alpha- and TNF-beta-driven B-cell proliferation was inhibited by the preincubation of leukemic B cells with utr-1 but not htr-9 MoAb. Moreover, anti-75-Kd, but not anti-55-Kd TNFR MoAb, was able to trigger the proliferation of leukemic B cells, and in particular of HC.

Here we demonstrate that a transfected CNTFR alpha gene is sufficient to confer CNTF responsiveness upon hemopoietic cells normally responsive only to LIF, providing evidence that CNTFR alpha is a required receptor component that uniquely characterizes CNTF-responding cells. Consistent with this notion, CNTFR alpha expression could be localized to neurons within all known peripheral targets of CNTF. CNTFR alpha was also widely expressed within neurons of the CNS, suggesting that CNTF has broader CNS actions than previously appreciated. However, in vivo localization of CNTFR alpha, as well as of CNTF itself, is consistent with a particularly important role for CNTF in motor function as well as during neuropoiesis.","['Ip, N Y', 'McClain, J', 'Barrezueta, N X', 'Aldrich, T H', 'Pan, L', 'Li, Y', 'Wiegand, S J', 'Friedman, B', 'Davis, S', 'Yancopoulos, G D']","['Ip NY', 'McClain J', 'Barrezueta NX', 'Aldrich TH', 'Pan L', 'Li Y', 'Wiegand SJ', 'Friedman B', 'Davis S', 'Yancopoulos GD']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Neuron,Neuron,8809320,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Brain/embryology/metabolism', 'Brain Chemistry', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Ganglia/chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/embryology/innervation/metabolism', 'Nervous System/embryology/*growth & development', 'Nervous System Physiological Phenomena', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Spinal Cord/chemistry/embryology/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transfection']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0896-6273(93)90245-M [pii]', '10.1016/0896-6273(93)90245-m [doi]']",ppublish,Neuron. 1993 Jan;10(1):89-102. doi: 10.1016/0896-6273(93)90245-m.,,,,,,,,,,

The gene configurations of immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH), T-cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta), and gamma chain (TCR gamma) in the granulocytic cells were identical to those in the blasts, indicating that both the blasts and the granulocytes were derived from common leukemic progenitors with the IgH gene rearrangements. In a colony assay of cells from in the Ph1 + ALL patient, the leukemic cells showed the potential to differentiate into granulocytes in the presence of either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF). Interleukin 7 (IL-7) exerted synergistic effects on colony and cluster formation in cultures with these cytokines. Further, IL-3, GM-CSF, and G-CSF receptor gene expression was found in the leukemic cells. Our findings indicate that the Ph1 + common progenitors in these three patients preserved the potential for granulocytic differentiation even after the occurrence of the Ig (and TCR) gene rearrangements as the first genomic event in lymphocyte differentiation.

We utilized a selected clone (I-83) of primary resting B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, inducible to activation, growth and differentiation in vitro, as a model system to study the possible role of TNF-alpha as an autocrine growth factor for such cells. Our results show that unstimulated I-83 B-CLL cells produced a low level of TNF-alpha mRNA, as shown by Northern blot analysis, and cytoplasmic TNF-alpha, determined in individual cells by immunocytochemistry. Secreted TNF-alpha could, however, not be detected in the medium by ELISA. TNF-alpha synthesis and secretion was, however, induced to high levels by stimulation of the B-CLL cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) after activation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan strain I (SAC) and B-cell stimulatory factor-MP6 (thioredoxin). A moderate increase in TNF-alpha secretion was also induced by TPA or IL-2 alone. IL-4 did not have any major effects on the production of TNF-alpha in activated cells, but inhibited the IL-2-induced production of TNF-alpha in SAC-activated cells. The cell surface expression of TNF-alpha receptors (TNF-R), as determined by binding assay using 125I-labelled recombinant TNF-alpha (rTNF-alpha), was also induced after SAC or TPA activation, but shed receptors (TNF-binding proteins) were only observed after TPA activation. Exogenously added rTNF-alpha in combination with TPA or SAC induced a high level of DNA synthesis in I-83 B-CLL cells. The increased endogenous production and secretion of TNF-alpha during induced growth stimulation, the induced expression of TNF-R, and the mitogenic effect of TNF-alpha on activated B-CLL cells raise the question whether TNF-alpha may function as an autocrine co-stimulator of B-CLL cell growth as recently suggested. anti-TNF-alpha and anti-TNF-R antibodies, however, failed to inhibit the IL-2- and IL-4-induced proliferation of activated I-83 B-CLL cells.","['Larsson, L G', 'Carlsson, M', 'Schena, M', 'Lantz, M', 'Caligaris-Cappio, F', 'Nilsson, K']","['Larsson LG', 'Carlsson M', 'Schena M', 'Lantz M', 'Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala, University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Feb;7(2):226-34.,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-2 (IL-2) has demonstrated activity against this disease in vitro and has produced regression in melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine in a prospective, nonblinded, phase II trial the activity of IL-2 in patients with extensive small-cell lung cancer who had not achieved complete remission with chemotherapy. METHODS: The 68 patients eligible for the study were initially treated with at least one dose of combination chemotherapy with cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide (PACE). Of the 50 who did not obtain complete remission with PACE, 24 who had measurable or evaluable disease and whose medical condition allowed further therapy were treated with IL-2. Beginning 3 weeks after the last dose of PACE, IL-2 was administered intravenously at 4.5 million Nutley units/m2 per day as a continuous infusion for 96 hours, followed by a 3-day rest. The planned duration of therapy was 8 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 24 patients eligible to receive IL-2, four (17%) with measurable disease or evaluable but not measurable disease obtained a complete response after IL-2 therapy; one (4%) patient had a partial response. The overall response rate was 21%. Complete responses continued for 8, 9, and more than 11 months in three patients; the remaining patient developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia while in complete remission approximately 8 months after the start of IL-2 therapy. Only five of the 24 patients were able to complete the planned 8 weeks of IL-2 therapy. Therapy was discontinued in 11 patients because of life-threatening side effects, in six because of disease progression, and in two who withdrew from the study, probably related to IL-2 toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that IL-2 has some activity in extensive small-cell lung cancer and suggest that IL-2 is not cross-resistant with PACE therapy. IMPLICATIONS: Further studies are needed to define the optimum timing, dose, and schedule of IL-2 and to determine whether the agent has a role in the therapy of small-cell lung cancer.","['Clamon, G', 'Herndon, J', 'Perry, M C', 'Ozer, H', 'Kreisman, H', 'Maher, T', 'Ellerton, J', 'Green, M R']","['Clamon G', 'Herndon J', 'Perry MC', 'Ozer H', 'Kreisman H', 'Maher T', 'Ellerton J', 'Green MR']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'CAE-P protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Etoposide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies']",1993/02/17 00:00,1993/02/17 00:01,['1993/02/17 00:00'],"['1993/02/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/17 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/17 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/85.4.316 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1993 Feb 17;85(4):316-20. doi: 10.1093/jnci/85.4.316.,"['CA-33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA033601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA035421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-476420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The present work has examined the effects of okadaic acid, an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, on EGR-1 expression during monocytic differentiation of U-937 myeloid leukemia cells. Treatment of U-937 cells with okadaic acid was associated with transient increases in EGR-1 mRNA levels. These increases were maximal at 6 h and occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that although EGR-1 transcription is detectable in untreated U-937 cells, this rate is increased 6-fold by okadaic acid. Sequences responsive to okadaic acid-induced signals were determined by deletion analysis of the EGR-1 promoter. The results demonstrate that okadaic acid-induced EGR-1 transcription is dependent on the presence of CC (A/T)6 GG (CArG) motifs. The EGR-1 promoter contains six CArG boxes. However, only the 5'-most distal (first) CArG sequence conferred okadaic acid inducibility. A 40-base pair oligomer corresponding to the first CArG element also conferred okadaic acid inducibility of the minimal thymidine kinase gene promoter. In contrast, there was no inducibility using a similar oligomer containing a mutated CArG box. Finally, binding of nuclear proteins to the first CArG sequence was similar for control and okadaic acid-treated cells. Taken together, these results suggest that okadaic acid activates EGR-1 transcription and that this event is mediated at least in part by a single CArG element.","['Kharbanda, S', 'Rubin, E', 'Datta, R', 'Hass, R', 'Sukhatme, V', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Rubin E', 'Datta R', 'Hass R', 'Sukhatme V', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,"['0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '1W21G5Q4N2 (Okadaic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Ethers, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Okadaic Acid', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1993 Jan;4(1):17-23.,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The ability of pertussis toxin and cholera toxin to ADP-ribosylate G(i) proteins coupled to formyl-peptide or LTB4 receptors in membranes isolated from HL-60 granulocytes was used to assess the conformational state of the alpha subunits. Cholera-toxin-catalysed ADP-ribosylation of alpha 40 (40 kDa alpha subunit) was inhibited by guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]triphosphate and GDP in a concentration-dependent manner. Addition of fMet-Leu-Phe, but not LTB4, re-established cholera-toxin labelling of alpha 40 in the presence of either guanine nucleotide.

To explore possible effects of the physiological burden of viral replication in chronic viral infections on AA availability, plasma total esterified fatty acid (FA) proportions were measured in the feline leukemia (FeLV) model. Plasma FA profiles of 12 specific-pathogen-free cats with chronic infections with Rickard strain feline leukemia virus (FeLV-R) were compared with 12 age- and sex-matched uninfected specific-pathogen-free cats at 4 months after infection. A significant decrease from normal of average AA proportion was found in FeLV-R-infected cat plasma, while other major FA (palmitic, stearic, and oleic and omega-3 FA normally remained present until near death. Since plasma FA content rapidly affects circulating immune cell membrane composition and since FeLV infection also targets immune cells, we compared FA profiles of feline T4-thymic lymphoma 3201 cell membranes that were infected with virulent FeLV-R or less virulent FeLV-A, at 20 days after viral inoculation with sham-inoculated uninfected 3201 cells. Significantly altered FA proportions and ratios of saturated to unsaturated FA found in infected cell membranes were similar to plasma FA changes and paralleled the virulence of the FeLV inoculum. Altered postinfection FA proportions may impart serious functional defects to the immune cells of chronic FeLV-infected cats, contributing to the inability of their immune systems to eliminate FeLV by depleted plasma AA stores and modified cell membrane composition. Decreased AA availability may be an important factor in the cachexia and fatal outcome of FeLV infection.","['Williams, L L', 'Lewis, M G', 'Olsen, R G', 'Lafrado, L J', 'Horrocks, L A', 'Rojko, J L']","['Williams LL', 'Lewis MG', 'Olsen RG', 'Lafrado LJ', 'Horrocks LA', 'Rojko JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

Unlike other membrane preparations, the RBL ghosts hydrolyze phosphoinositides (PIs) in response to aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) and have proven useful for studies of the molecular events involved in transduction of this signal. A significant limitation of these preparations is that they are sealed. Thus, to incorporate membrane-impermeant molecules (such as ATP) into the intravesicular space of the ghosts, they must be added as the ghosts are formed. We have now overcome this problem by permeabilizing the ghosts with alpha-toxin from S. aureus and find that, following permeabilization, ghosts activated via Fc epsilon RI, hydrolyze PIs for a longer time than do non-permeabilized ghosts. As in the intact ghosts, this response is absolutely dependent upon ATP and is enhanced by the addition of either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or creatine phosphate (CP).

When the cationic aminoglycosides, tobramycin and gentamicin were added to the cells in the presence of myeloperoxidase and H2O2, cytotoxicity was completely inhibited. In addition, tobramycin prevented cytotoxicity induced by cystic fibrosis sputum and H2O2. Protection against myeloperoxidase and H2O2 was also observed with the thioether-containing antibiotics, ticarcillin and ceftazidime, but at higher concentrations than with the aminoglycosides. Analysis of spectral properties, dimethylsulfoxide-mediated reduction, and ethyl acetate/NaCl partitioning, demonstrated that aminoglycosides converted HOCl to hydrophilic noncytotoxic chloramines, but were unable to prevent the oxidation of sulfhydryls and methionine by HOCl. In contrast, ticarcillin and ceftazidime were highly effective inhibitors of HOCl-mediated sulfhydryl and methionine oxidation. These results suggest that aminoglycosides protect lung epithelial cells against myeloperoxidase-dependent oxidant injury by binding to anionic cell surfaces and converting HOCl to hydrophilic noncytotoxic chloramines, whereas penicillins and cephalosporins are potent HOCl scavengers capable of protecting critical extracellular molecules against oxidation.","['Cantin, A', 'Woods, D E']","['Cantin A', 'Woods DE']","['Unite de Recherche Pulmonaire, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'DY38VHM5OD (Sodium Hypochlorite)', 'EC 1.11.1.6 (Catalase)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'F93UJX4SWT (Ticarcillin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'VZ8RRZ51VK (Tobramycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Catalase/pharmacology', 'Cats', 'Ceftazidime/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/drug effects', 'Gentamicins/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/enzymology', 'Lung', 'Methionine/pharmacology', 'Peroxidase/blood/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Sodium Hypochlorite/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Ticarcillin/pharmacology', 'Tobramycin/pharmacology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI116196 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1993 Jan;91(1):38-45. doi: 10.1172/JCI116196.,,,,,,,,,PMC329992,

Although vincristine plays an important role in chemotherapeutic regimens for ALL, it does not possess clinically significant activity in AML. Horseradish peroxidase, a heme-centered peroxidase, oxidatively degrades Vinca derivatives and thereby abrogates their cytotoxic activity. This finding suggested that myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme-centered peroxidase characteristically found in AML and not in ALL, might also degrade vincristine. We first examined the effects of MPO on vincristine in a cell-free system and demonstrated that this enzyme is capable of catalyzing vincristine's oxidative breakdown. We also observed that vincristine is more rapidly degraded in tissue culture by MPO-positive HL-60 cells than by a MPO-negative HL-60 subclone. The degree of MPO activity in these cell lines correlated in a positive manner with their degree of resistance to vincristine's cytotoxic activity. Moreover, the differential resistance to vincristine observed between these cell lines could be increased by increasing the concentration of H2O2 available to the enzyme. These data support the hypothesis that MPO-mediated oxidation of vincristine accounts in part for this drug's lack of activity in AML.","['Schlaifer, D', 'Cooper, M R', 'Attal, M', 'Sartor, A O', 'Trepel, J B', 'Laurent, G', 'Myers, C E']","['Schlaifer D', 'Cooper MR', 'Attal M', 'Sartor AO', 'Trepel JB', 'Laurent G', 'Myers CE']","['Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Drug Resistance/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Peroxidase/analysis/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)74302-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Jan 15;81(2):482-9.,,,,,,,,,,

These cultures were used to investigate the sensitivity of 3 ES (EW-2, RD-ES, SK-ES-1) and 3 pPNET (SIM-1, KAL, SAL) cell lines to a panel of anti-tumour agents in short-term (48-h) proliferation assays. Of the four cytostatic drugs included in the currently used multi-drug regimens, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and actinomycin-D inhibit the proliferation of the cell lines with high efficacy, whereas the vinca alkaloids were less effective. Cisplatin, etoposide, mitomycin-C and mitoxanthrone were also found to have a high inhibitory activity in this in vitro ES/pPNET system. The most remarkable effect was observed for cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C), which gave a half-maximal inhibition at drug concentrations approximately 5000 times below the clinical peak plasma concentrations (250 micrograms/ml). The ARA-C sensitivity of ES and pPNET cell lines is comparable with the established ARA-C sensitivities of leukaemia-derived cells. The different ES and pPNET cell lines showed a rather uniform response to the different cytostatic drugs with decreased sensitivity of individual pPNET cell lines to vinblastin, ARA-C and mitoxanthrone. Modulation of the IGF-I/IGF-I receptor/IGF-I binding protein system, which seems to constitute an important stimulator of cell growth in neuroectoderm-derived or -related tumours, can be used to enhance the drug sensitivity of the tumour cells in vivo or in vitro therapeutic procedures. According to our results, serum-free conditions for autologous bone marrow purification are expected to result in significantly increased chemosensitivity of ES and pPNET cells in response to anthracyclines and cisplatin.","['Hofbauer, S', 'Hamilton, G', 'Theyer, G', 'Wollmann, K', 'Gabor, F']","['Hofbauer S', 'Hamilton G', 'Theyer G', 'Wollmann K', 'Gabor F']","['Department of Surgery, University of Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0959-8049(93)90183-G [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(93)90183-g [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1993;29A(2):241-5. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(93)90183-g.,,,,,,,,,,

The prevention of FeLV infection consists, first, of avoiding the agent and, second, of providing optimum immunologic resistance. In multi-cat environments, the former is achieved through test-and-removal methods perennially reviewed in the literature and by minimizing exposure to outdoor cats. The latter is possible by attempting to maintain a low-stress, pathogen-free household and by the use of appropriate, effective immunization programs. Simple immunologic concepts used for the development of vaccines against feline distemper and rabies have evolved to enable generation of products that can now protect against retroviruses.

Cell lines with alterations in Top II are resistant to drugs that interact with the enzyme. Studies of the Top II from a Chinese hamster ovary line, VpmR-5, that is resistant to VP-16 and VM-26, demonstrated that it is very similar, qualitatively and quantitatively, to its normal counterpart except that DNA cleavage by the VpmR-5 enzyme is not stimulated by VP-16 or VM-26. To understand the basis for the drug-resistant phenotype, the Top II cDNAs were isolated from both Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and VpmR-5 cells by cDNA cloning with lambda gt22, and the entire cDNAs were sequenced. A mutation of G-->A at nucleotide 1478 was the only alteration observed in the VpmR-5 Top II cDNA compared with the wild-type gene. The mutation in VpmR-5 was confirmed by sequencing DNA fragments amplified from the genomic DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Southern blot hybridization analysis of genomic DNA demonstrated loss of a Top II allele in VpmR-5 probably occurred during the development of resistance to etoposide. The mutation in VpmR-5 changes amino acid 493 from arginine to glutamine and is located adjacent to a putative ATP binding site of Top II. Mutations in an analogous region have been identified in two human leukemia cell lines by amplification of segments of Top II cDNA with Taq DNA polymerase. Taken together, these observations suggest that mutations in this region of the gyrase B domain of mammalian topoisomerase II may be capable of conferring resistance to antineoplastic agents that interact with this enzyme.","['Chan, V T', 'Ng, S W', 'Eder, J P', 'Schnipper, L E']","['Chan VT', 'Ng SW', 'Eder JP', 'Schnipper LE']","['Charles A.

In susceptible mice (C57BL/6J), inoculation with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus, which consists of the BM5d virus and replication-competent B-tropic ecotropic (BM5e) and milk cell focus-inducing (BM5-MCF) helper viruses results in the polyclonal proliferation of T and B cells, immunodeficiency, and the expansion of B cells containing the BM5d provirus followed by the development of B-cell lymphomas. Several strains of mice that are resistant to LP-BM5-induced murine AIDS have been identified, and major histocompatibility complex genes as well as non-major histocompatibility complex genes were shown to play a role in this resistance. In the present study, we have examined and compared the replication of the BM5d and BM5e viruses after inoculation of LP-BM5 into sensitive (C57BL/6J) and resistant (C57BL/KSJ) mice. Using a specific polymerase chain reaction, we could detect the BM5d and BM5e proviruses as early as 1 week postinfection in the sensitive mice, and the levels of both viruses increased significantly with the progression of the disease. In contrast, in the resistant C57BL/KSJ mice, replication of BM5d and BM5e was restricted and no BM5d and only very low levels of the BM5e provirus could be detected either at early or late times postinoculation with the LP-BM5 virus mixture. Inoculation with LP-BM5 did not lead to the production of antibodies that could recognize the BM5d-encoded Pr60gag in either the sensitive or resistant mice; however, production of antibodies recognizing the env-related proteins of the helper virus was detected in the resistant but not in the sensitive mice at late times postinfection. Interestingly, inoculation with LP-BM5 increased polyclonal stimulation of spleen cells and decreased mitogen stimulation in both strains of mice. This stimulation of splenocytes persisted in the sensitive mice but decreased after a few weeks in the resistant mice. These results show an early block in BM5d and BM5e replication in the resistant C57BL/KSJ mice and indicate that resistance is a consequence of the inhibition of an onset of the BM5d virus infection and its expansion. However, initial responses to virus infection such as proliferation of spleen cells and response to mitogen are similar in both strains of mice and are therefore not necessarily related to the development of the disease.","['Pozsgay, J M', 'Reid, S', 'Pitha, P M']","['Pozsgay JM', 'Reid S', 'Pitha PM']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Defective Viruses/growth & development', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*growth & development', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/growth & development', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*physiopathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology/microbiology', '*Virus Replication']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.2.980-988.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Feb;67(2):980-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.2.980-988.1993.,"['5T32CA09243/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI19737/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC237452,

Previously, OM-10.1 cultures were characterized to respond to exogenous TNF-alpha, as nearly 100% of the cells were activated to express HIV-1 within 24 h. In this study, OM-10.1 cells were pulse-treated, by applying exogenous factors for short periods of time and then washing, to determine if autocrine TNF-alpha could sustain HIV-1 activation in the absence of additional exogenous stimulation. After a TNF-alpha pulse treatment, the progressive increase of HIV-1-expressing OM-10.1 cells was prevented by the continuous presence of anti-TNF-alpha mAb. The inductive activity of supernatant from TNF-alpha pulse-treated OM-10.1 cultures was completely removed by absorption on immobilized anti-TNF-alpha mAb. In addition, TNF-alpha pulse-treated OM-10.1 cells activated HIV-1 expression in untreated OM-10.1 cells when cultured across a permeable membrane indicating paracrine effects. Interestingly, if TNF-alpha pulse-treated OM-10.1 cells were further pulse-treated with anti-TNF-alpha mAb, a marked reduction in autocrine TNF-alpha was observed although the level of newly synthesized TNF-alpha mRNA remained unaffected. A similar degree of inhibition over autocrine TNF-alpha production was observed when soluble TNF receptors were used as the second pulse treatment in these experiments. Although the applicability of these results to in vivo chronically HIV-1-infected cells remains to be realized, these results do indicate that activated HIV-1 expression can be influenced by self-perpetuating mechanisms during periods of limited exogenous stimulation. Furthermore, physiologic mechanisms involving soluble cytokine receptors that counteract autocrine and paracrine activation of HIV-1 expression are shown here to play a regulatory role.","['Butera, S T', 'Roberts, B D', 'Folks, T M']","['Butera ST', 'Roberts BD', 'Folks TM']","['Retrovirus Diseases Branch, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, GA 30333.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HIV-1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/physiology', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', '*Virus Activation']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Jan 15;150(2):625-34.,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to clarify the role of cAMP second messenger system in the regulation of human PTHRP gene expression in ATL cells, using an HTLV-I-infected T-cell line, MT-2. Forskolin and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt2cAMP) caused a marked and transient increase in the steady-state level of PTHRP mRNA. The effects of these agents were dose-dependent, and the maximal effects were observed at 3 h. Nuclear runoff transcription assay showed that forskolin and Bt2cAMP caused an increase in the transcription rate of the human PTHRP gene. In contrast, the stability of PTHRP mRNA was only modestly increased by these agents. Forskolin and Bt2cAMP also increased the secretion of PTHRP by MT-2 cells, as determined by both a newly established immunoradiometric assay using two antibodies against human PTHRP-(1-34) and PTHRP-(50-83) and a radioimmunoassay using an antibody against human PTHRP-(109-141). Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) caused a marked stimulation of intracellular cAMP production in MT-2 cells, whereas PGE2 and PGF2 alpha had only modest effects. The ability of these PGs to stimulate cAMP production correlated well with their ability to increase PTHRP mRNA level and the secretion of PTHRP. Indomethacin did not affect the basal level of cAMP production or PTHRP mRNA, suggesting that endogenous PG was not involved in the basal production of cAMP or PTHRP. When PGE1 was given to MT-2 cells together with interleukin 2, which is another stimulator of PTHRP gene expression, PTHRP secretion was synergistically stimulated. These results suggest that the transcription of the human PTHRP gene is enhanced through a cAMP-dependent pathway by PGE1 and that PGE1, as well as interleukin 2, plays an important role in the overexpression of the human PTHRP gene in HTLV-I-infected T cells leading to the development of hypercalcemia in ATL patients.","['Ikeda, K', 'Okazaki, R', 'Inoue, D', 'Ogata, E', 'Matsumoto, T']","['Ikeda K', 'Okazaki R', 'Inoue D', 'Ogata E', 'Matsumoto T']","['Fourth Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'B7IN85G1HY (Dinoprost)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Bucladesine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colforsin/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dinoprost/pharmacology', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', '*Genes', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Time Factors', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1993/01/15 00:00,1993/01/15 00:01,['1993/01/15 00:00'],"['1993/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)54056-4 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Jan 15;268(2):1174-9.,,,,,,,,,,

The TAA recognized by the c143 MAb (c143 TAA) was mainly expressed on B-cells, macrophages, reticular cells, and a minor population of BoCD4-positive T-cells in bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-free normal cattle. When the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal cattle were activated in vitro, some populations of BoCD8-positive T- and non-T/non-B-cells also showed expression. Moreover, B-cells expressed the c143 TAA until the antigen was lost from cells at the final stage of B-cell differentiation, namely, the plasma cell stage. The c143 MAb-positive cells in blood of BLV-free normal cattle form heterologous subpopulations, and these cells coexpress other surface markers such as BoCD2, BoCD5, BoCD6, and B-cell-specific molecules B1 low, B1 bright, and B2. In BLV-infected cattle, the proportion of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that express the c143 TAA increased with the progression of EBL, and, in addition, BLV-infected cattle that had no lymphosarcomas showed increased proportions of c143 MAb-positive cells that coexpressed surface IgM (sIgM), BoCD5, B1 low, and B2 but not BoCD2, BoCD4, or BoCD6. Furthermore, most of the c143 MAb-positive tumors from all cattle with EBL appeared to be a monoclonal population derived from a single B-cell and to be divided into two types, c143 TAA+BoCD5+B1 low+ B2+ sIgM+ or sIgM-.

However, in neuronal cultures depleted of protein kinase C (PKC) activity by chronic phorbol ester treatment, neither CNTF nor LIF elevated ChAT activity. Further, the stimulation of ChAT due to increased cell density was not observed in PKC-depleted sympathetic neurons. The inhibition of CNTF-stimulated ChAT by phorbol ester occurred in a dose-dependent manner and chronic phorbol ester treatments did not alter the levels of the catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. Moreover, increased levels of diacylglycerol, an endogenous activator of PKC, were observed in sympathetic neurons treated with CNTF. However, neither CNTF nor LIF stimulated the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate.

The deoxyguanosine-resistant cells (dGuo-R) were 126-fold less sensitive to deoxyguanosine than the wild-type cells. The IC50 values for araC and araG were increased, but only 10-12-fold in the dGuo-R cells when compared with the wild-type cells.

Deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity was decreased only slightly (19%) when deoxycytidine was utilized as substrate; when cytosine arabinoside or deoxyguanosine was used as the substrate, the kinase activity in the extracts from the dGuo-R cells was only 10% of the enzyme activity in the extracts from the wild-type cells. The determination of the kinetic parameters, Km and Vmax, indicated that there were marked decreases in the Vmax values for deoxyguanosine and cytosine arabinoside as substrates, but not for deoxycytidine as substrate; the Km values for deoxycytidine and cytosine arabinoside were increased in the extracts from the dGuo-R cells.

The Tax/Rex and alternatively spliced mRNAs could be detected at their highest levels in BLV-infected cell cultures; the next highest levels were found in samples from calves experimentally infected at 6 weeks postinoculation. Alternatively spliced mRNAs were also expressed, albeit at lower levels, in naturally infected animals; they were detected by a nested polymerase chain reaction. Interestingly, the GIV mRNA was specifically detected in naturally infected cows with persistent lymphocytosis and in two of five calves at 6 months after experimental infection with BLV. Furthermore, the calf with the strongest signal for GIV had the highest lymphocyte counts. These data may suggest a correlation between expression of the GIV product and development of persistent lymphocytosis.

The CWD recombinant accelerated the onset of lymphoma in both strains, but the disease latency in the HRS/J mice was about 2 months longer. Analysis of the recombinant viruses in the HRS/J tumors revealed that the injected type II env recombinant had recombined in vivo with the endogenous ecotropic viruses to generate secondary recombinants with type I envelope genes. In another set of experiments, comparison of complete or partial DNA sequences of the envelope genes from six recombinant proviruses confirmed that the origins of the sequences that encode an amino-terminal region of the TM envelope protein, p15E, distinguish type I envelope genes from type II. Taken together with the results of previous studies, these observations suggest that the differences in the responses of HRS/J and CWD mice to the oncogenic type II env recombinant resulted from an interaction between the viral TM protein and a host factor expressed in HRS/J mice.","['Thomas, C Y', 'Coppola, M A', 'Nuckols, J D', 'Lawrenz-Smith, S C', 'Massey, A C']","['Thomas CY', 'Coppola MA', 'Nuckols JD', 'Lawrenz-Smith SC', 'Massey AC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia Health Sciences Center, Charlottesville 22908.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (p15E protein, Murine leukemia virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Recombinant/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Genes, Viral/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Hairless/microbiology', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', '*Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.1.294-304.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Jan;67(1):294-304. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.1.294-304.1993.,"['5-T32-CA09109/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F-32-AI07957/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA32995/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC237363,

Since cellular TfR expression is tightly regulated by the availability of iron, we investigated the effects of transferrin-gallium (Tf-Ga) on TfR mRNA levels in myeloid HL60 and lymphoid CCRF-CEM cells. In HL60 cells, Tf-Ga increased TfR mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion. This increase in TfR mRNA was blocked by Tf-Fe and by cycloheximide. Analysis of the rate of mRNA decay in the presence of actinomycin D revealed that the half-life of TfR mRNA was increased in HL60 cells incubated with Tf-Ga. The rate of transcription of TfR mRNA was not increased by Tf-Ga. In contrast with HL60 cells, CCRF-CEM cells displayed a decrease in the level of TfR mRNA after incubation with Tf-Ga. Tf-Ga inhibited iron uptake in both HL60 and CCRF-CEM cells but increased the level of TfR mRNA only in HL60 cells, suggesting that the Tf-Ga induction of TfR mRNA was not solely due to inhibition of cellular iron uptake. At growth-inhibitory concentrations, Tf-Ga increased the TfR mRNA level in HL60 cells but decreased it in CCRF-CEM cells. Our studies suggest that in HL60 cells, gallium regulates TfR expression at the post-transcriptional level by mechanisms which require de novo protein synthesis and involve interaction with iron. The divergent effects of Tf-Ga on TfR mRNA in myeloid HL60 and lymphoid CCRF-CEM cells suggest that differences exist in the regulation of TfR expression between these two cell types.","['Ul-Haq, R', 'Chitambar, C R']","['Ul-Haq R', 'Chitambar CR']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'CH46OC8YV4 (Gallium)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Gallium/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transferrin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2940873 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1993 Sep 15;294 ( Pt 3):873-7. doi: 10.1042/bj2940873.,['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC1134543,

The factors unfavorable for remission duration were high leukocyte count and late CR. Those unfavorable for survival were advanced age and elevated blood urea nitrogen. Further improvement in the design of new protocols which include the use of several cytokines and autologous bone marrow transplantation may result in prolonged disease-free survival.","['Yoshida, M', 'Kurata, H', 'Tsunoda, S', 'Iwama, A', 'Suzuki, T', 'Akutsu, M', 'Imagawa, S', 'Tsunoda, J', 'Furukawa, Y', 'Komatsu, N']","['Yoshida M', 'Kurata H', 'Tsunoda S', 'Iwama A', 'Suzuki T', 'Akutsu M', 'Imagawa S', 'Tsunoda J', 'Furukawa Y', 'Komatsu N', 'et al.']","['Dept. of Medicine, Jichi Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Pharmacodynamics deals with the relationship between therapeutic or toxic response and pharmacological measurements. It is suggested that the lack of pharmacodynamic information is currently limiting the application of pharmacokinetic information to cancer therapy. The studies contain pharmacodynamics of hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities, tumor response and cellular pharmacodynamics. It would be desirable to develop pharmacodynamic models using a limited sampling model during phase II trials, when all patients are treated with the same recommended dose, to relate pharmacokinetic parameters to tumor responses. The return knowledge of pharmacodynamics to cancer chemotherapy makes the concept of individualized therapy, adaptive control strategy with feedback (ACF) and targeted systemic exposure strategy (TSES). St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is now performing a randomized prospective trial to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of conventional dosages versus individualized therapy using TSES with ACF in Acute lymphocytic leukemia pulse therapy with high-dose methotrexate, teniposide, and cytarabine. It would be a good model for the establishment of oncological pharmacology-based optimal administration of anticancer drugs.","['Ohtsu, T', 'Sasaki, Y']","['Ohtsu T', 'Sasaki Y']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, National Cancer Center Hospital East, Kashiwa, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Then the drug reaches to tumor cells and is incorporated into the cells. After activated, it induces damage of DNA strands, inhibition of DNA synthesis and suppression of the cell proliferation. Each agent shows different behavior in each step of pharmacodynamics. 1) Blood drug level; distribution of antitumor agent in red and white blood cells, and plasma after administration is different among drugs. Lipophilic drug such as behenoyl ara-C is well absorbed and stored in red blood cell membrane, which is re-utilized effectively for the maintenance of plasma drug levels. Drugs having strong DNA binding affinity such as anthracycline, are accumulated in white blood cells and their blood levels are correlated with the white blood cells counts. 2) Incorporation of antitumor agents into the cells; especially incorporation of nucleoside analogs are correlated with the number of nucleoside transport sites of the cell membrane. Drug incorporation is also greatly influenced by activation and inactivation of drug in the cells. 3) Activation of the drugs in the cells; the activation reactions require the corresponding enzymes and cofactors. Activation of ara-C depended on deoxy cytidine kinase activity, whereas activation of 6-mercaptopurine required hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. The latter is the limiting factor of the activation reaction. In a case of rapid activation of a certain drug, such as ara-C, in a cell suspension, intracellular concentration of its active form exceeded extracellular concentration of the drug within 10 min of the incubation time. 4) Effects of nucleotide pool changes by antitumor agent on activation of the other antitumor drug; inhibitors of riboside diphosphate reductase, such as fludarabine or hydroxyurea, reduced deoxynucleoside triphosphates pools, and the reduction resulted in the decrease of feedback inhibition of deoxy cytidine kinase. Subsequently, activation of ara-C to its nucleotides was increased. 5) DNA damage by antitumor agents and its repair; a part of DNA damages induced by labile DNA binder are repaired. Inhibition of the repair would be effective for increasing antitumor effects. 6) Suppression of drug inactivation; in a case of ara-C, inactivation is nearly 100 times higher than activation. A number of procedures for suppressing the drug inactivation have been investigated to increase production of intracellular active form of the drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Nakamura, T', 'Ueda, T']","['Nakamura T', 'Ueda T']","['First Dept. of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Analysis of 50 biopsy-proven cases with an emphasis on occurrence in myelodysplastic syndromes.,276-84,"The hematologic, cytomorphologic, and cytogenetic features of 50 cases of leukemia cutis (LC), occurring in 40 patients, are presented. The patients' ages ranged from 19 to 75 years (mean, 42 years). The primary hematologic diagnoses in these patients included acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), 13 patients; myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), 19 patients; chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 3 patients; chronic granulocytic leukemia, 3 patients; and polycythemia vera, 1 patient. Leukemia cutis developed in one patient without any known prior or subsequent hematologic disorder. The 13 cases of ANLL included French-American-British types M1 (1 case), M2 (5 cases), M3 (1 case), M4 (5 cases), and M5 (1 case). Leukemia cutis preceded blood and/or bone marrow manifestations of leukemia in nine patients with MDS and one with ANLL. The interval from skin biopsy to systemic leukemia ranged from 3 weeks to 20 months (mean, 6 months). In seven patients with MDS and three patients with ANLL, LC occurred concomitantly with leukemic transformation. Only two patients with MDS and LC did not have progression to acute leukemia during the 20 and 24 months they have been observed. Diagnoses other than LC initially were considered in five of the patients. LC was characterized most often by a dense mixed cellular dermal infiltrate that circumscribed vascular and adnexal structures. Nine patients with MDS (47%) and one with ANLL (8%) had complex chromosomal abnormalities in their bone marrow samples at the time of LC. This article reports the occurrence of LC in patients with MDS and suggests that LC is an early manifestation of leukemic transformation in these patients. These results may be important in identifying high-risk patients for early interventional therapy.","['Longacre, T A', 'Smoller, B R']","['Longacre TA', 'Smoller BR']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, CA 94305.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Chromosome Aberrations/etiology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin/*pathology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/100.3.276 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1993 Sep;100(3):276-84. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/100.3.276.,,,,,,,,,,

From the human K562 leukemia cells, we isolated a clone, KS, that is resistant to the cytopathic effect of the H-1 virus and displays a suppressed malignant phenotype. The suppressed malignancy and the cellular resistance to H-1 killing appear to depend on the activity of wild-type p53. Whereas the KS cells express wild-type p53, the protein is undetectable in the parental K562 cells.

RB1 gene deletions may thus participate in malignant transformation of B-CLL, but it is also possible that a neighboring gene on 13q is the relevant one. To answer this question the remaining RB1 allele of eight clones with hemizygous deletions was studied by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, and immunofluorescense techniques. Cells from 10 patients without RB1 gene deletions were also studied by these methods. Lack of RB1 mRNA and RB protein expression was seen in leukemia cells from one of the patients. All other cases were found to be normal with regard to immunofluorescense, RT-PCR, and SSCP analysis, indicating at least one functional RB1 allele and supporting the importance of another gene in the 13q14 deletions. We then performed extended Southern blot analyses of the 13q region, using probes for 10 different loci. In 14 of 31 CLL clones (45%), deletions of a region telomeric to the RB1 gene (D13S25) were observed. In 4 of the cases the deletions were homozygous. Hemizygous deletions of the RB1 gene were observed in 11 of these patients and in none of the patients without D13S25 deletions. These data thus indicate that a gene(s) telomeric to RB1 is involved in the malignant transformation of CLL clones and that deletions of this region are a common event in this disease.","['Liu, Y', 'Szekely, L', 'Grander, D', 'Soderhall, S', 'Juliusson, G', 'Gahrton, G', 'Linder, S', 'Einhorn, S']","['Liu Y', 'Szekely L', 'Grander D', 'Soderhall S', 'Juliusson G', 'Gahrton G', 'Linder S', 'Einhorn S']","['Division of Experimental Oncology, Radiumhemmet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*analysis/genetics']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.18.8697 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8697-701. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.18.8697.,,,['RB1'],,,,,,PMC47425,

We report here translocation of MLL with nine different chromosomes and two paracentric chromosome 11 deletions in early B cell, B- or T-cell lineage, or nonlymphocytic acute leukemias. The mRNA translocation junction from 22 t(4;11) patients, including six adult leukemias, and nine t(11;19) tumors reveals a remarkable conservation of breakpoints within MLL, AF4, or ENL genes, irrespective of tumor phenotype. Typically, the breakpoints are upstream of the zinc-finger region of MLL, and deletion of this region can accompany translocation, supporting the der(11) chromosome as the important component in leukemogenesis. Partial sequence of a fusion between MLL and the AFX1 gene from chromosome X shows the latter to be rich in Ser/Pro codons, like the ENL mRNA. These data suggest that the heterogeneous 11q23 abnormalities might cause attachment of Ser/Pro-rich segments to the NH2 terminus of MLL, lacking the zinc-finger region, and that translocations occur in early hematopoietic cells, before commitment to distinct lineages.","['Corral, J', 'Forster, A', 'Thompson, S', 'Lampert, F', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Slater, R', 'Kroes, W G', 'van der Schoot, C E', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Karpas, A']","['Corral J', 'Forster A', 'Thompson S', 'Lampert F', 'Kaneko Y', 'Slater R', 'Kroes WG', 'van der Schoot CE', 'Ludwig WD', 'Karpas A', 'et al.']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc Fingers/*genetics']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.18.8538 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8538-42. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.18.8538.,,,,,,,,,PMC47392,

We have initiated the functional analysis of the LCR by homologous recombination in murine erythroleukemia cell somatic hybrids that carry a single copy of human chromosome 11 on which the beta-globin locus is situated. High-level expression of the human beta-globin gene normally occurs when these hybrid cells are induced to differentiate. We have reported that the insertion of an expressed selectable marker gene (driven by the Friend virus enhancer/promoter) into the LCR disrupts the LCR-mediated regulation of globin transcription. In these cells, beta-globin is no longer expressed when the cells differentiate; instead, expression of the selectable marker gene increases significantly after differentiation. Since present techniques for homologous recombination require the insertion of a selectable marker, further progress in using homologous recombination to analyze the LCR depends on deletion of the selectable marker and demonstration that the locus functions normally after the insertion, expression, and deletion of the selectable marker. Here we show that after precise deletion of the selectable marker by using the FLP recombinase/FRT (FLP recombinase target) system, the locus functions as it did before the homologous recombination event. These studies demonstrate the feasibility of using homologous recombination to analyze the LCR in particular, and other complex cis-regulatory DNA elements in general, in their normal chromosomal context.","['Fiering, S', 'Kim, C G', 'Epner, E M', 'Groudine, M']","['Fiering S', 'Kim CG', 'Epner EM', 'Groudine M']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (FLP recombinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/*genetics', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Ribonucleases', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.18.8469 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Sep 15;90(18):8469-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.18.8469.,"['1F32HL08732/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01DK44746/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5R01HL48356/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,PMC47378,

However, we found no deletion of cellular sequences around the integration site of such a defective HTLV-1. Rather, we identified 99 bp-long direct repeats adjacent to both ends of the defective provirus. The repeated cellular sequences contained a potential poly(A) signal followed by a retroviral primer-binding-site-like sequence.

These primary tumors are capable of growing when transplanted into syngenic mice, but die after several days of in vitro culture. From the transplanted tumors grown in syngenic mice, erythropoietin-dependent cell lines were established in culture that are clonally related to cells in the primary tumors.

Northern analysis with an MLL cDNA probe detected different signals in t(11;19) cell lines, one being sized 10 kb in two cell lines, KOCL-33 and KOCL-44, and the other being 9.2 kb in the cell line, KOPN-1. To elucidate the molecular basis for the heterogeneity, we isolated cDNA clones of a translocation-associated gene on chromosome 19, LTG19, as well as chimeric cDNAs from KOPN-1. Northern analysis with LTG19 cDNA demonstrated the identical gene, encoding serine/proline rich 559 amino acid polypeptide, to be involved in all three cell lines. Sequence comparison revealed that the LTG19 portion of the predicted chimeric protein of KOPN-1 was fused in frame and contained the C-terminal 189 amino acids. This was shorter by 366 amino acids than those of KOCL-33 and KOCL-44, also fused in frame. Reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis demonstrated complex chimeric mRNAs in cell lines and leukemia samples. Although a chimeric mRNA of KOPN-1 type was rare, its presence suggested that the shared C-terminal portion of 189 amino acids of LTG19 contains important signal(s) for malignant transformation.","['Yamamoto, K', 'Seto, M', 'Komatsu, H', 'Iida, S', 'Akao, Y', 'Kojima, S', 'Kodera, Y', 'Nakazawa, S', 'Ariyoshi, Y', 'Takahashi, T']","['Yamamoto K', 'Seto M', 'Komatsu H', 'Iida S', 'Akao Y', 'Kojima S', 'Kodera Y', 'Nakazawa S', 'Ariyoshi Y', 'Takahashi T', 'et al.']","['Laboratories of Chemotherapy, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Oct;8(10):2617-25.,,,['LTG19'],"['GENBANK/D14539', 'GENBANK/D14540']",,,,,,

European Bone Marrow Transplantation-Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party.,1152-7,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Recent studies have shown that long-term survivors of acquired aplastic anemia may be at high risk for malignant diseases. We assessed the risk of cancer after aplastic anemia was treated with immunosuppression or bone marrow transplantation and sought to identify risk factors according to treatment. The study population consisted of 860 patients treated by immunosuppression and 748 patients who had received bone marrow transplants for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia. The risk of cancer was analyzed overall and according to treatment relative to the risk in the general population. In calculating relative risk, we excluded patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute leukemias arising less than 6 months after treatment, and solid cancers arising less than 12 months after treatment, because of a possible association with aplastic anemia itself rather than with the treatment received. RESULTS: Forty-two malignant conditions were reported in the 860 patients who received immunosuppressive therapy: 19 cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, 15 cases of acute leukemia, 1 case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 7 solid tumors. Nine were reported in the 748 patients who received bone marrow transplants: two cases of acute leukemia and seven solid tumors. After the exclusions listed above, the overall relative risk of cancer was 5.50 (P < 0.001) as compared with that in the general European population; the risk was 5.15 (P < 0.001) after immunosuppressive therapy and 6.67 (P < 0.001) after transplantation. The 10-year cumulative incidence rate of cancer was 18.8 percent after immunosuppressive therapy and 3.1 percent after transplantation. The risk factors for myelodysplastic syndrome or acute leukemia after immunosuppressive therapy included the addition of androgens to the immunosuppressive treatment (relative risk = 0.28), older age (relative risk = 1.03), treatment in 1982 or later, as compared with 1981 or earlier (relative risk = 3.01), splenectomy (relative risk = 3.65), and treatment with multiple courses of immunosuppression (relative risk = 2.26). Risk factors for solid tumors after bone marrow transplantation were age (relative risk = 1.11 per year) and the use of radiation as a conditioning regimen before transplantation (relative risk = 9.56); such tumors occurred only in male patients. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of aplastic anemia are at high risk for subsequent malignant conditions. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute leukemia tend to follow immunosuppressive therapy, whereas the incidence of solid tumors is similar after immunosuppression and after bone marrow transplantation.","['Socie, G', 'Henry-Amar, M', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Hows, J', 'Tichelli, A', 'Ljungman, P', 'McCann, S R', 'Frickhofen, N', ""Van't Veer-Korthof, E"", 'Gluckman, E']","['Socie G', 'Henry-Amar M', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Hows J', 'Tichelli A', 'Ljungman P', 'McCann SR', 'Frickhofen N', ""Van't Veer-Korthof E"", 'Gluckman E']","['Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors']",1993/10/14 00:00,1993/10/14 00:01,['1993/10/14 00:00'],"['1993/10/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/14 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199310143291603 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Oct 14;329(16):1152-7. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199310143291603.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: 42 patients 1-22 years of age suffering from solid tumors, hematological and oncological diseases, with clinical signs of infection, increased serum CRP (> 1 mg/dl) and/or fever above 38.5 degrees C and neutropenia (WBC count and/or ANC < 1 x 10(9)/l) were included in this outpatient based study. One important exclusion criterion was poor clinical condition with symptoms of septic shock. METHODS: After bacterial, fungal and viral cultures had been obtained, single agent broad spectrum cephalosporin treatment was initiated with ceftriaxone applied once daily in a dose of 80 mg/kg body weight as short infusion over 30 min. Daily examinations included WBC, CRP, physical inspection and reassessment. In case of persistence or increase of fever and CRP, either outpatient management was carried on with teicoplanin added or patients were hospitalized and switched to combination antibiotic regimen. RESULTS: There were 64 febrile episodes in 42 patients. Single agent once daily broad spectrum cephalosporin was adequate in 43/64 (67%) of infectious episodes in neutropenic patients. For persisting or increased fever or CRP elevation, 9 patients were treated with ceftriaxone and teicoplanin successfully. Thus hospitalized was avoided in 52/64 (81%) of infectious episodes.","['Preis, S', 'Jurgens, H', 'Friedland, C', 'Oudekotte-David, A A', 'Thomas, L', 'Gobel, U']","['Preis S', 'Jurgens H', 'Friedland C', 'Oudekotte-David AA', 'Thomas L', 'Gobel U']","[""Heinrich Heine Universitat, Children's Hospital, Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dusseldorf.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '61036-62-2 (Teicoplanin)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Body Temperature Regulation/drug effects', 'Ceftriaxone/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/therapeutic use', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Opportunistic Infections/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Teicoplanin/*administration & dosage']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1025240 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1993 Jul-Aug;205(4):295-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1025240.,,,,,,,,,,

The current German therapeutic protocols are mainly based on short-term infusion. We determined pharmacokinetic parameters during short-term infusion in 18 children aged between 10/12 and 17 years on different therapeutic schedules in order to investigate interpatient variability. The dosages ranged from 66 to 200 mg/m2. In the subgroup of patients who received 150 mg/m2 (n = 10) the AUC was 106 +/- 15 micrograms.h/ml (range 82-139), clearance 24 +/- 3 ml/min/m2 (18-31), t1/2 3.5 +/- 0.4. To compare kinetic data of all 21 courses in 18 children, standard AUC was calculated (AUC/100 mg/m2). The AUC then was (68 +/- 17 micrograms.h/ml)/(100 mg/m2). Half-life was 3.3 +/- 0.7 h and total clearance 26 +/- 6 ml/min/m2, respectively. In 5 courses in children < 2 years (< 10 kg), pharmacokinetic parameters were within the normal range. In this group dosage was calculated per kg. Dose reduction of 31% (mean) resulted in 22% (mean) lower AUC's. In conclusion, interpatient variability of etoposide pharmacokinetics during short-term infusion is limited. Dose reduction in children < 2 years is not substantiated by our pharmacokinetic data.","['Boos, J', 'Real, E', 'Schulze-Westhoff, P', 'Probsting, B', 'Wolff, J', 'Jurgens, H']","['Boos J', 'Real E', 'Schulze-Westhoff P', 'Probsting B', 'Wolff J', 'Jurgens H']","['Universitats-Kinderklinik, Padiatrische Hamatologie/Onkologie, Munster.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infusion Pumps', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Neoplasms/*blood/drug therapy']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2007-1025239 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1993 Jul-Aug;205(4):288-94. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-1025239.,,,,,,,,Pharmakokinetik der Etoposid-Kurzinfusionen im Rahmen der GPOH-Therapieprotokolle.,,

Neurotrophic effects of MK were examined using cultured spinal cord and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons derived from fetal mouse. MK, which was added to the culture medium at concentrations of 1-100 ng/ml, promoted survival of both types of neurons approximately 5-fold after 7 days in culture. For spinal cord neurons, the increased survival was reflected in an increase of choline acetyltransferase activity. MK also promoted neurite extension in spinal cord (2-fold) and DRG (1.7-fold) neurons. The survival-promoting activity of MK to these neurons was comparable to that of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In spite of its significant effects on fetal neurons, MK was ineffective in sustaining survival of DRG neurons derived from postnatal mice. From these results, we conclude that MK is a neurotrophic factor to embryonic spinal cord and DRG neurons, and we propose that MK plays a significant role in embryogenesis of the nervous system.","['Michikawa, M', 'Kikuchi, S', 'Muramatsu, H', 'Muramatsu, T', 'Kim, S U']","['Michikawa M', 'Kikuchi S', 'Muramatsu H', 'Muramatsu T', 'Kim SU']","['Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '137497-38-2 (Midkine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.3.1.6 (Choline O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cellular Senescence', 'Choline O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', '*Cytokines', 'Fetus', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*cytology/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/*pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Midkine', 'Neurites/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Neurons/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology/enzymology', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.490350509 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 1993 Aug 1;35(5):530-9. doi: 10.1002/jnr.490350509.,,,,,,,,,,

Structural analyses of the proviruses from cell lines with diverse pathogenic effects provided no clear correlation with lethality. The rabbit lines were provisionally designated T cells because they express interleukin 2R (IL-2R) and CD5 and lack surface immunoglobulin, but none express functional T cell receptor (TCR) alpha or beta transcripts. A more detailed characterization of the HTLV-I-infected cells was required to determine cell lineage and its potential influence on pathogenic consequences. Probes for rabbit TCR gamma and delta genes were derived and used to detect gamma and delta TCR RNA transcripts, identifying the in vitro transformed lines as gamma/delta T cells. CD4+ and CD8+ lines were derived from PBMC of HTLV-I-infected rabbits and CD4+ TCR-alpha/beta HTLV-I lines were derived from rabbit thymus, eliminating the possibility that the HTLV-I isolates used here transform only CD4- CD8- TCR-gamma/delta cells. The percentage of gamma/delta cells in rabbit PBMC is relatively high (23% in adult rabbits); this with diminution of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in IL-2-supplemented PBMC or thymocyte cultures may account for selection of rabbit HTLV-I-infected gamma/delta T cell lines in vitro. The availability of well-characterized T cell lines with diverse in vivo effects in the rabbit HTLV-I disease model allows evaluation of roles played by cell type in HTLV-I-mediated disease.","['Sawasdikosol, S', 'Hague, B F', 'Zhao, T M', 'Bowers, F S', 'Simpson, R M', 'Robinson, M', 'Kindt, T J']","['Sawasdikosol S', 'Hague BF', 'Zhao TM', 'Bowers FS', 'Simpson RM', 'Robinson M', 'Kindt TJ']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Twinbrook II Facility, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/*analysis', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression', 'HTLV-I Infections/immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*analysis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/*microbiology/ultrastructure']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.178.4.1337 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1993 Oct 1;178(4):1337-45. doi: 10.1084/jem.178.4.1337.,,,"['TCR&dgr;', 'TCR&ggr;']","['GENBANK/L22290', 'GENBANK/L22291', 'GENBANK/L22292', 'GENBANK/L22293']",,,,,PMC2191202,

The infection with BALB-Moloney murine sarcoma virus, containing a v-HA-ras oncogene, renders this cell line IL-3 independent and continuously growing in the presence of G-CSF, nontumorigenic and with an apparent block at the level of promyelocyte/myelocyte (32D-Ha-ras). After infection with Abelson murine leukemia virus containing a v-abl oncogene, the cell line originates (32D-abl) that is also IL-3 independent but is tumorigenic and unable to differentiate in the presence of G-CSF. This cellular model allowed us to study the relationship between distinct steps of cell differentiation, neoplastic transformation, and C3 synthesis, activation, and characteristics of binding. We demonstrated that C3 synthesis, release, and cleavage are properties already present in the progenitor 32DCl3(G) cells. The more differentiated 32D-Ha-ras cells acquired C3 acceptor sites, apparently completely saturated by the constitutively released molecules. The transformation with Abelson murine leukemia virus, although it did not affect all these properties, let the cells bind considerable amounts of C3-related fragments activated in normal murine serum through the alternative pathway.

Signaling in this system involves hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide by action of a neutral sphingomyelinase and stimulation of a ceramide-activated protein kinase (Dressler, K. A., Mathias, S., and Kolesnick, R. N. (1992) Science 255, 1715-1718). To clarify the role of this pathway in TNF action, the present studies assessed the effect of the sphingomyelin pathway on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), an event considered integral to the transfer of the TNF message to the cell nucleus. As shown previously, TNF (1 nM) induced a marked increase in nuclear NF-kappa B binding in human leukemia (HL-60) cells within 5 min, and elevated binding was detected for as long as 1 h. Addition of a maximally effective concentration of sphingomyelinase, 0.1 units.ml-1, induced a 50% reduction in sphingomyelin content by 5 min from a basal level of 560 pmol.10(6) cells-1 and a quantitative increase in ceramide levels from 89 pmol.10(6) cells-1. Sphingomyelinase 0.1 units.ml-1 also induced an increase in nuclear NF-kappa B binding within 5 min, an effect measurable for as long as 1 h. As little as 1 x 10(-5) units.ml-1 sphingomyelinase was effective and a maximal effect occurred with 1 x 10(-3) units.ml-1. A cell-permeable ceramide analog, C8-ceramide, which mimics biologic effects of TNF-alpha, also enhanced nuclear NF-kappa B activation within minutes. In contrast, addition of a phospholipase C or a synthetic diacylglycerol (DG) analog, 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol, failed to enhance nuclear NF-kappa B binding despite large increases in cellular DG content. Further, TNF-alpha induced elevation in ceramide content by 2 min to 185% of control but did not affect DG levels. These studies provide evidence that stimulation of the sphingomyelin pathway leads to NF-kappa B activation in HL-60 cells.","['Yang, Z', 'Costanzo, M', 'Golde, D W', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Yang Z', 'Costanzo M', 'Golde DW', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Sloan-Kettering Institute, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1069-87-0 (1,2-dioctanoylglycerol)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Ceramides/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Diglycerides/pharmacology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/metabolism', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/pharmacology']",1993/09/25 00:00,1993/09/25 00:01,['1993/09/25 00:00'],"['1993/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80756-X [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 25;268(27):20520-3.,"['R01-CA-57400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL42107/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA30388/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In a previous study we demonstrated that the differentiation agent sodium butyrate causes a rapid reduction in the expression of c-myc RNA in the rectal carcinoma cell line SW837. This effect was blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis, suggesting that butyrate causes the induction of an activity that has a negative effect on c-myc expression. In the present work we demonstrate that the rapid decrease in the level of c-myc RNA, upon treatment of SW837 cells with 2 mM butyrate, is followed by a slower decrease in the level of p53 RNA and an increase in the RNA levels for fibronectin and a placental type alkaline phosphatase. Using in vitro elongation of nascent transcripts to measure transcription and actinomycin D chase experiments to measure RNA stability, we show that the reduction in expression of c-myc RNA is due to an increase in the block to transcriptional elongation, rather than a decrease in transcriptional initiation or an increase in degradation of the RNA. We conclude that sodium butyrate induces an activity that increases the transcriptional block in SW837 cells, and that regulation of transcriptional elongation is an important mechanism for regulating c-myc expression in this cell type. A shift in relative usage of the two major promoters in the c-myc gene accompanies the reduction in expression. The potential significance of this finding with respect to transcriptional elongation is discussed. Mutations in the exon 1/intron 1 boundary region of the c-myc gene cause an increase in transcriptional elongation in Burkitt lymphoma. We sequenced this region in a series of cell lines derived from colorectal carcinomas, all of which had an elevated level of c-myc expression, to determine if a similar mutational mechanism is at work in this disease. All of the lines examined had a normal c-myc DNA sequence, suggesting that the deregulation of c-myc expression in colon cancer is not due to a cis mutation in this region.","['Heruth, D P', 'Zirnstein, G W', 'Bradley, J F', 'Rothberg, P G']","['Heruth DP', 'Zirnstein GW', 'Bradley JF', 'Rothberg PG']","[""Children's Mercy Hospital, Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Kansas City, Missouri.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antisense Elements (Genetics))', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (RNA Probes)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antisense Elements (Genetics)', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*drug effects', 'RNA Probes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Rectal Neoplasms', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/25 00:00,1993/09/25 00:01,['1993/09/25 00:00'],"['1993/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80749-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 25;268(27):20466-72.,['CA50246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that the A-kinase-deficient cells produce hemoglobin normally in response to exogenous hemin and that the heme precursor delta-aminolevulinate (delta-ALA) significantly increases HMBA-induced synthesis of heme and globin chains in these cells; these data suggest that impaired heme synthesis is at least partially responsible for the cells' deficient hemoglobin synthesis. HMBA-induced expression of the erythroid-specific delta-ALA synthetase, porphobilinogen deaminase, and beta-globin mRNAs was less in A-kinase-deficient cells than in parental cells and was reduced in proportion to the cells' residual A-kinase activity; relative transcription rates of these genes were reduced concordantly. Impaired expression of these three erythroid-specific genes was a feature of many independently-derived A-kinase-deficient clones, and normal expression was found in transfectants with normal A-kinase activity. The A-kinase-deficient cells did not exhibit a generalized defect in gene regulation since mRNA expression and transcription rates of H- and L-ferritin, c-myc, c-myb, and several housekeeping enzymes were similar in HMBA-treated parental and A-kinase-deficient cells.

Molecular characterization of glutathione-platinum complex and its biological significance.,20116-25,"Accumulating evidence suggests a critical role of intracellular glutathione in tumor cell resistance to alkylating agents. The present study provides evidence for the direct interaction between cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin) and glutathione (GSH) both in a cell-free system, as well as in L1210 murine leukemia cells. We have isolated the reaction product and identified it by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Stoichiometric analysis showed a 2:1 molar ratio of GSH/cisplatin for the reaction. The molecular mass assessed by mass spectroscopy was 809 Da, corresponding to a GS-platinum chelate complex, bis-(glutathionato)-platinum. The GS-platinum complex was detected in L1210 leukemia cells incubated with 20 microM cisplatin. The intracellular content of the GS-platinum complex reached a maximal level after 12 h, corresponding to about 60% of the intracellular platinum content. Thus, formation of the GS-platinum complex is considered a significant part of the cellular metabolism of cisplatin. The GS-platinum was found to inhibit cell-free protein synthesis in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system using both chloramphenicol acetyltransferase mRNA and poly(A) mRNA from HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells (IC50 = 190 microM the GS-platinum complex). Elimination of the GS-platinum complex from tumor cells may represent an important mechanism which reduces the intracellular accumulation of the platinum complex. Using plasma membrane vesicles prepared from L1210 cells, the transport of the GS-platinum complex across the plasma membrane was found to be an ATP-dependent process (apparent Km values: 49 microM, ATP; 110 microM, GS-platinum complex). The ATP-dependent transport of the GS-platinum complex was inhibited by vanadate (IC50 = 35 microM) as well as by S-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-glutathione, leukotriene C4, and GSSG, but not by doxorubicin, daunorubicin, or verapamil. The ATP-dependent glutathione S-conjugate export pump, ""GS-X pump"" (Ishikawa, T. (1992) Trends Biochem.

The present studies used peptides with single-site amino acid substitutions within this sequence to assess substrate recognition by ceramide-activated protein kinase. Substitution of alanine for the C-terminal but not the N-terminal proline reduced kinase activity by 80%. Similarly, substitution of basic residues for the leucine residue reduced kinase activity by 90%. Substitution of acidic residues for leucine, or its removal, also markedly reduced kinase activity. Surprisingly, addition of a leucine residue between threonine and the C-terminal proline enhanced kinase activity 3-4 fold. The Vmax(app) of the enzyme toward the control peptide containing -Pro-Leu-Thr-Pro- (200 +/- 11 pmol of peptide phosphorylated/min/mg of membrane protein) was enhanced 2.3-fold by ceramide. However, ceramide had no effect on the Km (2.0 +/- 0.4 mM). Membranes containing ceramide-activated protein kinase showed minimal activity toward peptides derived from substrates for casein kinase II, S6 kinase, protein kinase C, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase, but possessed substantial activity toward a calmodulin kinase substrate. However, activities toward these substrates were not enhanced by ceramide. These results suggest that ceramide-activated protein kinase may be a member of the proline-directed class of protein kinases and display specificity for -Leu-Thr-Pro- as a minimal substrate recognition motif.","['Joseph, C K', 'Byun, H S', 'Bittman, R', 'Kolesnick, R N']","['Joseph CK', 'Byun HS', 'Bittman R', 'Kolesnick RN']","['Laboratory of Signal Transduction, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Microsomes/enzymology', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Phosphopeptides/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Proline', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/25 00:00,1993/09/25 00:01,['1993/09/25 00:00'],"['1993/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(20)80686-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 25;268(27):20002-6.,"['CA-42385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57400-01S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-16660/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To identify new structures characteristic of activated lymphocytes, we developed a series of mAbs against functionally defined human T-cell clones or the NK-mediating cell line YT2C2. In this study, we report the isolation of an mAb termed AY19 recognizing, at the cell surface, an 85-kD glycoprotein whose expression is restricted to T-lymphocyte clones, leukemic T-cell lines, and T-ALL peripheral blood cells. Biochemical studies, as well as phenotypic analysis, revealed that this structure is different from all previously identified molecules on the cell surface of lymphocytes. Furthermore, functional studies showed that triggering of this 85-kD structure on cloned T-lymphocytes through the AY19 epitope led to an inhibition of CD3-induced proliferation. These findings suggest that the AY19 mAb defines a T-cell antigen expressed mainly on long-term dividing lymphocytes and, therefore, its putative ligand might play a role in the regulation of T-lymphocyte growth induced by CD3-TcR stimulation.","['Mansur, I G', 'Leca, G', 'Pratt, J C', 'Degos, L', 'Boumsell, L', 'Bensussan, A']","['Mansur IG', 'Leca G', 'Pratt JC', 'Degos L', 'Boumsell L', 'Bensussan A']","['INSERM U 93, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'CD3 Complex/physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0198-8859(93)90140-V [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(93)90140-v [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1993 May;37(1):31-8. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(93)90140-v.,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We report treatment results with fludarabine and prednisone in 22 pretreated B-CLL patients in progressive disease, refractory to CHL and other regimens. RESULTS: One patient obtained a complete response (CR), 8 obtained a partial response (PR). Thirteen failed to respond to treatment. Among the partial responders, 1 patient had fatal pneumonia while neutropenic, another died of disease progression. Among the non responders, 7 died of progressive disease, and 3 evolved into high-grade NHL. Three are still alive in disease progression.

In all these groups there were cases with cytochemical features of both myeloid and monocytic type (alpha-naphthyl-acetate esterase positive). No immunological and cytogenetic differences were observed; the morphological variant with basophilic granules was more frequent in females; age distribution was not related to the morphological subtype; organomegaly was extremely rare in M3b. A low white blood cell count was constant in M3b, whereas no differences were observed in hemoglobin and platelet values.

PDGF is stored in the alpha-granules of blood platelets, which are derived from bone marrow megakaryocytes and lack transcriptional machinery. Human myeloid leukemia cell line K562 can be used as a model for megakaryocytes. Phorbol-ester-mediated megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells is accompanied by more than 200-fold increase in the c-sis mRNA level. We have now localized transcriptional enhancers at -8.6 kb and -9.9 kb relative to the human c-sis gene transcription start site. The enhancer at -8.6 kb increases activity of the c-sis promoter by 40-60-fold specifically in K562 cells and comaps with a DNase-I-hypersensitivity (DH) site. The enhancer at -9.9 kb increases c-sis promoter activity by 5-10-fold in K562 cells and DH at that site accompanies phorbol-ester-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. In phorbol-ester-treated K562 cells the two enhancers may be negatively influenced by a silencer that comaps with DH at -10.7/-11.0 kb. Reporter gene analysis predicted that combined activity of the upstream enhancers and the c-sis promoter may result in 100-1000-fold higher promoter activity in phorbol-ester-treated K562 cells compared with untreated cells, which can fully explain the more than 200-fold increase in c-sis mRNA level. DH at -8.6 kb and -9.9 kb was also detected in human fibroblasts and in the carcinoma cell lines HeLa and PC3, which express, respectively, undetectable, low and high levels of c-sis mRNA. Although the individual DH sites displayed 4-10-fold enhancer activity in all these cells, they lost most of their biological activity when combined in a larger fragment. In addition we localized (part of) a new transcription unit at approximately 13 kb upstream of the c-sis transcription start site. The corresponding 0.45-kb sis upstream region (sur) transcript is constitutively expressed in all cell lines examined. The expression of the sur transcript is independent of the expression of c-sis mRNA and of the pattern of DH sites far upstream of the c-sis gene. Thus, at present, there is no indication that the upstream DH sites are involved in regulation of expression of the sur gene.","['Dirks, R P', 'Jansen, H J', 'Onnekink, C', 'De Jonge, R J', 'Bloemers, H P']","['Dirks RP', 'Jansen HJ', 'Onnekink C', 'De Jonge RJ', 'Bloemers HP']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18167.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Sep 1;216(2):487-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18167.x.,,,"['PDGF-B', 'c-sis']",,,,,,,

Here we show that three classes of such trophic factors promote oligodendrocyte survival in vitro: (1) insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), (2) neurotrophins, particularly neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and (3) ciliary-neurotrophic factor (CNTF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). A single factor, or combinations of factors within the same class, promote only short-term survival of oligodendrocytes and their precursors, while combinations of factors from different classes promote survival additively. Long-term survival of oligodendrocytes in vitro requires at least one factor from each class, suggesting that multiple signals may be required for long-term oligodendrocyte survival in vivo. We also show that CNTF promotes oligodendrocyte survival in vivo, that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can promote the survival of oligodendrocyte precursors in vitro by acting on a novel, very high affinity PDGF receptor, and that, in addition to its effect on survival, NT-3 is a potent mitogen for oligodendrocyte precursor cells.","['Barres, B A', 'Schmid, R', 'Sendnter, M', 'Raff, M C']","['Barres BA', 'Schmid R', 'Sendnter M', 'Raff MC']","['Department of Biology, University College, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Neurotrophin 3)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Somatomedins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/physiology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Insulin/physiology', 'Interleukin-6/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/physiology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/physiology', 'Neurotrophin 3', 'Oligodendroglia/*physiology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Somatomedins/physiology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 1993 May;118(1):283-95.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS. Thirty adults with refractory or relapsed ALL were treated. Their median age was 45 years, 60% were in second or subsequent relapse, and 37% had Philadelphia chromosome-positive disease. Treatment consisted of ara-C 1 g/m2 during a period of 2 hours daily for 6 days, and fludarabine 30 mg/m2 during a period of 30 minutes daily for 5 days on days 2-6. Fludarabine was given 4 hours before ara-C to increase the rate of ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP) accumulation in leukemic cells. Courses were repeated every 3 weeks or longer, depending on patient response and side effects. RESULTS: Nine (30%) patients achieved a complete remission (CR), 8 (27%) died during remission induction, and 13 (43%) had resistant disease. The median CR duration was 22 weeks, and the median survival was 12 weeks for all patients, and 34 weeks for those who had a response to treatment. Except for low platelet counts, which predicted shorter survival time, no other prognostic factors were demonstrated, considering the small number of patients treated. Myelosuppression-associated febrile episodes were the most common side effects, occurring in 28 (93%) patients. Neurotoxicity was noted in two (7%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Fludarabine and ara-C are an active and relatively safe antileukemic combination in refractory or relapsed ALL. Future studies will incorporate other anti-ALL agents, such as topoisomerase II-reactive drugs, to improve the overall efficacy, and growth factors, to reduce myelosuppression-related complications.","['Suki, S', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Gandhi, V', 'Estey, E', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Beran, M', 'Rios, M B', 'Plunkett, W', 'Keating, M']","['Suki S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Gandhi V', 'Estey E', ""O'Brien S"", 'Beran M', 'Rios MB', 'Plunkett W', 'Keating M']","['Department of Hematology, M.

The debate about the direct or indirect relationship of GH and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) to the occurrence or recurrence of malignancy, especially in the case of GH therapy in patients with leukemia, is still unresolved. We, therefore, studied the effect of GH and IGF-I on bone marrow of patients with acute leukemia (ALL and AML) in diagnosis and recurrence and in chronic leukemia patients (CML) in remission. GH increased blast colony numbers by a mean of 68% and 77% at GH concentrations of 250 and 300 ng/ml, respectively. IGF-I increased blast colony numbers in ALL patients by 50, 93 and 105%, and in AML patients by 33, 58 and 65%, at IGF-I concentrations of 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively. In 3 CML patients in remission a granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assay did not reveal stimulation of peripheral blood blast colony formation by GH or IGF-I. Our in vitro data (as previously reported) suggest that GH and IGF-I may promote blast cell proliferation, and the supplemental administration of these peptides in leukemia patients in remission must be carefully monitored for early relapse. Additional studies on bone marrow cells of leukemic patients in remission are needed in order to examine the effects of GH and IGF-I on these cells.","['Zadik, Z', 'Estrov, Z', 'Karov, Y', 'Hahn, T', 'Barak, Y']","['Zadik Z', 'Estrov Z', 'Karov Y', 'Hahn T', 'Barak Y']","['Pediatric Endocrine Unit, Kaplan Hospital, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Pediatr Endocrinol,The Journal of pediatric endocrinology,8510464,"['67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Growth Disorders/drug therapy', 'Growth Hormone/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/jpem.1993.6.1.79 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Endocrinol. 1993 Jan-Mar;6(1):79-83. doi: 10.1515/jpem.1993.6.1.79.,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical and experimental investigations have given contradictory answers to the question whether GVHD and GVLR are two manifestations of the same process or separate immunologic processes. We have addressed this question by analysing the primary in vitro response of BM-derived proliferating and cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (PTLp and CTLp) in HLA identical relative pairs (n = 17). PTLp frequency estimation reveals strong responses (> 1 in 5000) on non-leukemic as well as leukemic stimulation in a majority of cases. CTLp amount variably to 10-100% of the proliferating precursor cells. Preliminary specificity analyses show that on non-leukemic stimulation about 90% of colonies exhibit exclusive lysis of the non-leukemic target.

Nine to fourteen days later 4 patients achieved a mean leukocyte nadir of 3.5 x 10(9)/L (Range 2.4-4.9) and a mean platelet nadir of 99 x 10(9)/L (Range 95-108).

One patient failed to achieve any Ph suppression. Polymerase chain reaction analysis (PCR) for the bcr-abl fusion product remained positive in all samples. Rapid rises in CFU-GM numbers were associated with a return to 100% Ph positive metaphases however slower rises represented recovery with predominantly Ph negative cells, allowing apheresis collection of these cells.

In vitro incubation of CLL cells with the parent nucleoside of fludarabine, arabinosyl-2-fluoroadenine (F-ara-A), indicated that F-ara-ATP accumulated in a linear fashion in response to the product of the F-ara-A concentration times the duration of incubation. Exposing cells longer with lower F-ara-A concentrations or shorter with higher F-ara-A concentrations resulted in similar intracellular levels of F-ara-ATP as long as the products of fludarabine concentration and time of exposure were equal.

Three weeks after the first attendance the patient again suffered superficial thrombophlebitides of all extremities. Clinically she exhibited symptoms of recurrent mild pulmonary embolization. Contrast venography revealed no signs of deep venous thrombosis of legs, pelvis, or cava inferior. Despite continuous full-dose intravenous heparin administration the patient died, with signs of fulminant pulmonary embolization. Surprisingly, necropsy revealed a complete thrombotic occlusion of the pulmonary arterial system caused by pulmonary arteritis with signs of recurrent pulmonary embolization from a parietal truncus pulmonalis thrombosis. In addition, an appositional growth of parietal thrombi central from peripheral arterial ramifications had occurred. Simultaneously, superficial thrombophlebitis of all extremities was observed without any additional signs of general vasculitis. There was no strong evidence for a causal relationship between the chronic myelogenous leukemia and pulmonary arteritis nor for any other underlying systemic disorder. Therefore we consider the pulmonary arteritis a possibly primary one.

The rational design of L-cisAMTB was based on previously observed potent enzyme inhibitory activity for its closely related structural analog, L-2-amino-4-methoxy-cis-but-3-enoic acid (L-cisAMB). The kinetic behavior of L-cisAMTB was studied using AdoMet synthetase isozymes I and II fractionated from L1210 murine leukemia cells. L-cisAMTB, which was a competitive inhibitor with respect to L-methionine, gave apparent Ki values of 21 and 5.7 microM for isozymes I and II, respectively. These values indicate that L-cisAMTB was slightly less inhibitory than L-cisAMB. L-cisAMTB was also a substrate for the AdoMet synthetase reaction, with respective Km values of 555 and 33 microM for isozymes I and II. In the absence of added inhibitors, the activity of isozyme II, but not isozyme I, was stimulated 2.5-fold by the presence of 10% DMSO. This preferential stimulation of isozyme II and the highly significant difference in Km values of L-cisAMTB for isozymes I and II point to possible physical differences in these tumor isozymes that were not apparent in earlier studies.","['Sufrin, J R', 'Lombardini, J B', 'Alks, V']","['Sufrin JR', 'Lombardini JB', 'Alks V']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '143800-82-2 (2-amino-4-methylthio-3-butenoic acid)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Isoenzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Methionine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mice']",1993/09/03 00:00,1993/09/03 00:01,['1993/09/03 00:00'],"['1993/09/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/03 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/03 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(93)90067-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(93)90067-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Sep 3;1202(1):87-91. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(93)90067-2.,"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY04780/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We found that the depolarization of K(+)-diffusion potential of liposomes or the leakage of an entrapped molecule, calcein, progress at a much slower rate than the photosensitized damage to proteins and the photosensitized killing of bacterial and leukemic cells. X-ray microanalysis revealed that upon light exposure of HP-treated leukemic cells and bacteria, they totally lost their cellular potassium. We deduce that the direct photosensitized oxidation of lipid components cannot cause the depolarization of cells, which in turn could be responsible for their death. A photosensitized damage to protein sites in the cell, probably in the membrane, is a more likely reason for the depolarization, the loss of potassium ions and cell death that is caused in light-activated photodynamic processes.","['Ehrenberg, B', 'Gross, E', 'Nitzan, Y', 'Malik, Z']","['Ehrenberg B', 'Gross E', 'Nitzan Y', 'Malik Z']","['Department of Physics, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '53026-44-1 (Bacteriorhodopsins)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)']",IM,"['Bacteriorhodopsins/chemistry', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line/chemistry/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', '*Light', 'Liposomes/radiation effects', 'Membrane Lipids/chemistry/*radiation effects', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/*radiation effects', 'Photochemotherapy', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Potassium/*analysis', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/chemistry', 'Staphylococcus aureus']",1993/09/19 00:00,1993/09/19 00:01,['1993/09/19 00:00'],"['1993/09/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/19 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0005-2736(93)90110-L [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(93)90110-l [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1993 Sep 19;1151(2):257-64. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(93)90110-l.,,,,,,,,,,

No p53 protein could be detected by immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-p53 antibodies. We have transfected this line with the temperature-sensitive murine Val135 construct that is expressed as mutant p53 at 37 degrees C and largely wild-type p53 at 32 degrees C. There was no difference in the number of viable cells among the p53 transfectants, the parental cells, and neomycin vector-transfected control cells at 37 degrees C. Following a temperature shift to 32 degrees C, the p53 transfectants rapidly lost viability, and 95-100% of the cells were dead by 3 days, whereas the control cells remained unaffected. Examination of DNA isolated from p53-transfected cells grown at 32 degrees C revealed nucleosomal fragmentation, indicating cell death by apoptosis. It is suggested that apoptosis is triggered by contradictory signaling.

The Km and Vmax values for the influx of methotrexate into CEM cells did not differ significantly from those of CEM/MTX cells, and this was the case for gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate as well. Surface binding and influx rates were proportional to cell surface area, but differences in efflux rates and methotrexate uptake were too large to be explained on this basis. Neither methotrexate nor trimetrexate competed with gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate influx in CEM cells. However, both drugs perturbed the gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate steady state in CEM cells, resulting in slightly less uptake than with gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate alone. However, the major difference between the two cell types was in the methotrexate uptake plateau, which was much greater in the case of the parental cell line. A related observation was the more rapid efflux of methotrexate from CEM/MTX cells than from CEM cells. The poor uptake, the associated meager capacity to polyglutamylate methotrexate and the enhanced methotrexate efflux appear to be responsible for its decreased activity against CEM/MTX cells. Half-lives for gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate efflux were the same in both cell lines, allowing the drug to accumulate to cytotoxic levels despite its inability to form polyglutamates.","['Wright, J E', 'Rosowsky, A', 'Cucchi, C A', 'Flatow, J', 'Frei, E 3rd']","['Wright JE', 'Rosowsky A', 'Cucchi CA', 'Flatow J', 'Frei E 3rd']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['79640-76-9 (gamma-tert-butyl methotrexate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Line/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/analysis', 'Trimetrexate/metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90496-J [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90496-j [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Sep 1;46(5):871-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90496-j.,"['P01-CA19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA25394/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Of several peptide-reactive culture supernatants that resulted from cell fusion of splenocytes with NS-1 myeloma cells, clones 2C5 (IgG2a) and 1D10 (IgG1) produced antibodies which detected a approximately 32kDa molecule in human NK cell lysates by Western blotting.

The specificity of reactivity with granzyme B was demonstrated by the reaction of the monoclonal antibody with active granzyme in the lysate of COS-7 cells transfected with human granzyme B cDNA, but not with granzyme H expressed in an identical fashion. Western blotting on Percoll-fractionated IL-2 activated human peripheral blood lymphocyte lysates and YT demonstrated reactivity of the monoclonal antibody with a approximately 32kDa species only in those fractions with granzyme A (BLT esterase) and B (Asp-ase) activities. Moreover, 2C5/1D10 antibodies coupled to Protein A-sepharose beads immunoprecipitated enzymatically active granzyme B from YT cell lysates.

An immunohistochemical and morphologic study of 28 cases.,1011-9,"In an attempt to correlate the morphologic and immunophenotypic findings in extramedullary myeloid cell tumors (EMT), we studied 28 cases with a large panel of antibodies using paraffin section immunohistochemistry. A previous or concurrent diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia was made in 25 cases. Six EMT were morphologically classified as well differentiated (WD-EMT), 17 as poorly differentiated (PD-EMT), and five as blastic EMT. The WD-EMT were easily recognized morphologically and displayed a relatively mature myeloid phenotype, with elastase, CD15, and CD68 positivity in all cases. On the other hand, the five blastic-EMT displayed no morphologic evidence of myeloid derivation, were completely negative for CD15, and were weakly positive for elastase in only one case. The PD-EMT, with a morphologic appearance that resembles large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, variably expressed CD15 and elastase. CD68 and lysozyme were present in the majority of PD-EMT, with some variability, but were negative in most blastic-EMT. CD45 (LCA) was detected in 75% of all EMT and CD34 was positive in 36%; neither antigen was significantly associated with a specific morphology. CD30 reactivity was not evident in any case, but slight positive staining was seen with CD20 (L26) in one WD-EMT. CD43 (Leu 22) was the only antibody that was positive in 100% of cases; staining was always intense and widespread. Antimyeloperoxidase (MPO) was positive in all cases but two, both with a blastic morphology. We conclude that (a) an immunohistochemical panel including CD20, CD43, CD68, and MPO can successfully identify the vast majority (96%) of EMT in paraffin sections, and (b) there is an association between morphology and phenotype in these lesions.","['Traweek, S T', 'Arber, D A', 'Rappaport, H', 'Brynes, R K']","['Traweek ST', 'Arber DA', 'Rappaport H', 'Brynes RK']","['James Irvine Center for Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*immunology/*pathology', 'Sarcoma/classification/*immunology/*pathology']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199310000-00006 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1993 Oct;17(10):1011-9. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199310000-00006.,['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We established two ALL cell lines (KMO-90 and KMO-R) from bone marrow samples of a 12-year-old girl with ALL. The drug concentrations needed to reduce optical density to 50% of that of control cells (IC50) showed that KMO-R was about twofold more resistant to doxorubicin (DOX), mitoxantrone (MIT), vincristine (VCR), and etoposide (VP-16) than was KMO-90. Considering that both KMO-90 and KMO-R were established from a patient with ALL at the time of presentation and relapse, respectively, these two cell lines might be novel and useful models for research into the acquisition of drug resistance in ALL cells. Although cytotoxicity of DPM in KMO-90 was about 6% at 1 microgram/ml, DPM enhanced cell sensitivity to DOX, MIT, VCR, and VP-16 at this concentration. Cytotoxicity of DPM in KMO-R was less than 5% at 1, 5, and 10 micrograms/ml. In KMO-R, DPM enhanced cell sensitivity to these four drugs in a dose-dependent manner. The plasma concentrations achieved by oral administration of DPM is about 1 microgram/ml. At clinically achievable concentrations, DPM enhanced cell sensitivity to DOX, MIT, VCR, and VP-16 in both KMO-90 and KMO-R, thus showing DPM to be a useful agent for potentiating anticancer chemotherapy of hematopoietic malignancy.","['Sotomatsu, M', 'Yugami, S', 'Shitara, T', 'Kuroume, T']","['Sotomatsu M', 'Yugami S', 'Shitara T', 'Kuroume T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Gunma University School of Medicine, Maebashi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Dipyridamole/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830430404 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Aug;43(4):251-5. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830430404.,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnosis of NHL was confirmed by histology. Nine had lymphoblastic lymphoma, three had histiocytic lymphoma and one had small non-cleaved cell lymphoma, according to the Rappaport classification. After thorough clinical evaluation eight children were NHL stage IV; four were stage III; and one was stage II. All these children had received chemotherapy as acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) high-risk protocol for a total of three years, including central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. Of the 13 patients, 9 (69.2%) gained complete remission. Over-all survival rate was 46.2%, with a median interval of 36 months. The complete remission rate and survival rate for the nine children with lymphoblastic lymphoma was better at 77.7% & 66.6% respectively. Within the nonresponsive group, two failed to remit because of early withdrawal from the protocol; the other two patients were refractory to treatment. Relapse was noted in one patient. As to the side effects, neutropenic fever was the most common problem encountered (9 occurrences in 13 patients). Other major complications included severe mucositis, massive GI bleeding, intracranial thrombosis induced by l-asparaginase and tumor lysis syndrome. Childhood NHL is often of diffuse types in pathology, and most affected children have advanced diseases at diagnosis.

There was no difference in terms of gender. The main affected racial group was white. A history of sexually transmitted diseases was a major risk factor for HAM/TSP and a positive serology for syphilis was found in 26.5% of the patients. The major clinical findings were of a spastic paraparesis with generalized brisk tendon jerks and bilateral Babinki's sign. Sensation was abnormal in 25 patients (73.5%) and five (14.7%) had a sensory level. Three patients (8.8%) had optic atrophy. The cerebrospinal fluid showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with a mean total protein content of 0.4 g/litre, and an increased intrathecal IgG synthesis in 59.4% of patients. HAM/TSP and multiple sclerosis (MS) occur indigenously in RJ and some HAM/TSP cases can be sometimes confused with MS.

In this study DNA analysis has been applied to improve differentiation of CMPD. All subtypes of CMPD analyzed, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM), polycythemia vera (PV), and essential thrombocythemia (ET), had in common that granulocytes and bone marrow cells were clonal in origin as shown by X-chromosome-linked DNA polymorphism in conjunction with methylation patterns. Reactive myeloproliferations, by contrast, revealed a polyclonal inactivation pattern. Clonality could not distinguish CMPD from cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) since the latter also exhibited clonal hematopoiesis. AMM belongs to the group of myeloproliferative syndromes. Up to now the cellular phase at onset of the disease (megakaryocytic myelosis) has not been analyzed for clonality of the hematopoietic cells. Granulocytes as well as bone marrow cells from the cellular phase and advanced stages of the disease revealed a monoclonal inactivation pattern of X-chromosomal genes. These results show that the cellular phase already represents a monoclonal, and hence probably a neoplastic, proliferation of a pluripotent stem cell. The monoclonality of granulocytes could also be demonstrated in patients with splenomegaly and strongly argues against a compensatory proliferation of regular hematopoiesis in this organ. Because of their clonal origin, peripheral granulocytes were used in all cases (n = 244) for the detection of bcr-gene rearrangement. Despite possible morphological overlaps between different types of CMPD, bcr-gene rearrangement proved to be specific for CML and could be applied to differentiate CML from other CMPD in cases of uncertain morphological diagnosis. It is concluded that CMPD represent clonal hemopoietic disorders that probably have specific underlying genetic defects. Thus, DNA analysis can substantially aid in the differential diagnosis of CMPD.","['Kreipe, H H']",['Kreipe HH'],"['Institut fur Allgemeine Pathologie und Pathologische Anatomie, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat Kiel.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Veroff Pathol,Veroffentlichungen aus der Pathologie,7504167,['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chronic Disease', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/*pathology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Veroff Pathol. 1993;141:1-158.,,,,,,372,,Histopathologie und Molekulare Pathologie chronischer myeloproliferativer Erkrankungen.,,

We have generated a series of mutants of the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) with alterations in the TM protein, p15E, and determined whether the mutants are defective for replication and where the defects lie. Twenty-one point mutants were assessed for infectivity, virion-associated envelope protein levels, and the ability to confer resistance to superinfection. Only one mutant was specifically defective in a post-receptor binding step. Three other mutants encoded virion-associated envelope proteins that could not confer resistance to superinfection, implying that they could not bind to the receptor.

In this study, we investigated the regulatory elements and cellular transcription factors which function in modulating HTLV-I gene expression in response to the viral transactivator protein, tax. Transfection experiments into Jurkat cells of a variety of site-directed mutants in the HTLV-1 LTR indicated that each of the three motifs A, B, and C within the 21-bp repeats, the binding sites for the Ets family of proteins, and the TATA box all influenced the degree of tax-mediated activation. Tax is also able to activate gene expression of other viral and cellular promoters. Tax activation of the IL-2 receptor and the HIV-1 LTR is mediated through NF-kappa B motifs. Interestingly, sequences in the 21-bp repeat B and C motifs contain significant homology with NF-kappa B regulatory elements. We demonstrated that an NF-kappa B binding protein, PRDII-BF1, but not the rel protein, bound to the B and C motifs in the 21-bp repeat. PRDII-BF1 was also able to stimulate activation of HTLV-I gene expression by tax. The role of the Ets proteins on modulating tax activation was also studied. Ets 1 but not Ets 2 was capable of increasing the degree of tax activation of the HTLV-I LTR.

Although CNTF is abundant in adult sciatic nerve, the mature protein lacks a signal sequence and is not secreted; therefore, it has been proposed to act as a lesion factor. The identification of a functional CNTF receptor revealed ligand-specific phosphorylation cascades and gene induction. However, it is not clear how these signal-transducing events are elicited in neuronal cell bodies that may be distant from the source of CNTF. We report here that CNTF can be retrogradely transported by adult sensory neurons. More importantly, sensory and motor neurons both show greatly increased transport of CNTF following peripheral nerve lesion. Axotomy-induced increases in retrograde transport of neurotrophic factors may be an important response of neuronal cell bodies during regeneration.","['Curtis, R', 'Adryan, K M', 'Zhu, Y', 'Harkness, P J', 'Lindsay, R M', 'DiStefano, P S']","['Curtis R', 'Adryan KM', 'Zhu Y', 'Harkness PJ', 'Lindsay RM', 'DiStefano PS']","['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., Tarrytown, New York 10591.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor', 'Ganglia, Spinal/cytology/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Motor Neurons/metabolism', 'Nerve Crush', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neurons, Afferent/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sciatic Nerve/drug effects/*injuries/metabolism']",1993/09/16 00:00,1993/09/16 00:01,['1993/09/16 00:00'],"['1993/09/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/16 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/16 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/365253a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1993 Sep 16;365(6443):253-5. doi: 10.1038/365253a0.,,,,,,,,,,

Here the use of a simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to monitor ALL disease activity has been validated. In the dilution experiments the method revealed a detection sensitivity 0.5% clonal cells in a background of 99.5% normal cells. To validate the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene PCH (IgH-PCR) in practice, we monitored the disease activity of 26 adult ALL patients showing a B-cell lineage component in immunophenotyping at the diagnosis of the disease. In 18 of those 26 patients, an IgH-PCR product could be demonstrated in the samples taken either at diagnosis or in relapse. These 18 patients were followed with a total of 158 consecutive samples by IgH-PCR. The mean follow-up time for the IgH-PCR-positive patients was 13.6 months (range 4 to 26 months). Eleven of these patients underwent altogether 18 relapses. In nine patients (81.8%), ten relapses (55.6%) could be predicted using the IgH-PCR approach. The mean time of IgH-PCR clonality detection, preceding a cytologic relapse, was 9.1 weeks (range 1.0 to 30.7 weeks). It seems that in three patients the predictive value of the IgH-PCR was remarkable, showing a repetitive positivity in spite of a cytologic remission, even one year prior to the relapse. We find that IgH-PCR provides a straightforward additional tool for monitoring B-cell lineage ALL.

Although present in many B cells, the vast majority of follicular center cells do not have detectable bcl-2 protein. The bcl-2 gene is translocated in most conventional small cleaved follicular center cell (SCFCC) lymphomas (centroblastic/centrocytic) but not in centrocytic lymphomas (CC). The translocated gene in the SCFCC lymphomas leads to 'aberrant' bcl-2 expression by the neoplastic follicular center cells. The frequency with which the normal non-translocated gene is expressed in CC lymphomas is, however, not well documented. Paraffin sections from 22 cases of centrocytic lymphoma were therefore stained with an anti-bcl-2 antibody. Genotypic studies in 14 cases demonstrated bcl-1/PRAD1 (cyclin D1; CCND1) rearrangements in ten and bcl-2 rearrangements in none. All centrocytic lymphomas demonstrated bcl-2 protein expression in the majority of neoplastic cells. Negative staining residual follicular centers were identified in four cases emphasizing the mantle zone growth pattern of a subset of CC lymphomas. Expression of bcl-2 protein in the absence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement is a feature shared by centrocytic lymphomas and mantle zone cells. However, because this type of bcl-2 expression is not specific for B-cells of the mantle zone, it does not further elucidate the true cell of origin for the centrocytic lymphomas.","['Swerdlow, S H', 'Utz, G L', 'Williams, M E']","['Swerdlow SH', 'Utz GL', 'Williams ME']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*metabolism', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Sep;7(9):1456-8.,['CA 46723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We analyzed rearrangement at the immunoglobulin (Ig) and T-cell receptor (TCR) loci, gene expression at these same loci (T beta, C mu, JH), as well as expression of components known to be involved in the process of rearrangement (RAG-1 and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, TdT). In the majority of acute leukemias, including those with myeloid phenotypes, we demonstrated events characteristic of early lymphoid differentiation. We observed that expression of TdT mRNA and sterile transcription at both the Ig and TCR loci (transcription without gene rearrangement) was unexpectedly common in both acute biphenotypic leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and occurred in the absence of phenotypic lymphoid differentiation. Furthermore, coordinated transcription of JH and T beta was frequently noted in the presence of C mu. RAG-1 was detected in approximately 50% of leukemias studied, but expression correlated inversely with TdT and did not correlate with sterile transcription or gene rearrangement.

In a preclinical setting, including candidates for autologous marrow transplantation, we have studied STLMC supported by a selected mixture of clinical available recombinant human haematopoietic growth factors. STLMC of leukemic marrow cells were prospectively performed to evaluate the purging effect. Bone marrow cells cultured and supported by the selected mixture of rhIL-3/rhGM-CSF/rhEpo revealed an increased number of day 10-12 cultured cells, parallelled by an increased proliferation rate when compared to unstimulated cultures. The median number of myeloid progenitors recognized as day 7 and day 14 granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (day 7/14 GM-CFU) was significantly increased in the supported STLMC to 145/305 from 105/115 per ml culture (n = 7, p < 0.01). Further addition of rhKL did not enhance the numbers of day 7 or day 14 GM-CFUs per ml culture. In no instance was the number of clonogenic cells at the end of culture greater than the input day 0, except in cultures of purified CD34-positive marrow progenitors which resulted in an expansion of late myeloid progenitors. Cytokine-supported cultures of leukemic marrow cells from acute myeloid (n = 14) and lymphoblastic (n = 7) leukemia patients were established at the time of diagnosis. In the supported cultures, the cell number increased for myeloblast but was unchanged for lymphoblast leukemic marrow cells compared to non-supported cultures. Immunophenotypic and cytogenetic studies of selected leukemic cell samples identified unchanged myeloid or slightly reduced frequencies of lymphoblastic leukemic cells at the end of culture. This preclinical study supports the idea that the addition of a mixture of clinical available haemopoietic cytokines to STLMC increases the recovery of detectable myeloid progenitors which may enhance myeloid regeneration after autografting.

To further characterize the mechanism of the in vitro anti-leukemia effect, fresh bone marrow from normal donors and from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in remission was cultured for 6 days in the absence or presence of IL-2 (1000 IU/ml). Proliferation of CD3, CD8, CD14, and CD56 cells was determined by direct immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. Predominantly T-lymphocytes (CD3+) and to a lesser extent CD56+ natural killer (NK) cells proliferate in 6-day marrow cultures in IL-2. Fresh bone marrow cells have no measurable NK activity when tested against K562 and Daudi target cell lines in a 4 h chromium-51 release assay, and it requires at least 6 days of culture in IL-2 to develop optimal cytotoxic activity. Cytokines released in the supernatants of these cultures were measured by immuno- and bioassays. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and IL-6 were found to be produced in significant amounts by marrow mononuclear cells during culture in IL-2. Even without IL-2 present, concentrations of these cytokines were increased in 6-day marrow cultures. In contrast, IL-3, IL-7, granulocyte and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF and GM-CSF) were below the level of detection of the immunoassay, a result that could be confirmed for GM-CSF and IL-3 by bioassay. The data suggest that culture of marrow from normal donors as well as from patients with AML obtained in remission can generate anti-leukemia effector mechanisms which are non-crossreactive with chemo- and radiotherapy and may contribute to effective ex vivo purging of residual leukemic cells. The transplantation of such IL-2 'primed' marrow may also contribute to an in vivo graft-versus-leukemia effect.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Neerunjun, J', 'Schwulera, U', 'Ziltener, H J']","['Klingemann HG', 'Neerunjun J', 'Schwulera U', 'Ziltener HJ']","['Leukemia/Bone Marrow Transplant Program of BC, Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Purging', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Sep;7(9):1389-93.,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, a trend for an association between megakaryoblastic involvement of blast crisis and breakpoint localization in the 3' extreme of the M-bcr segment was also noted.","['Urbano-Ispizua, A', 'Cervantes, F', 'Matutes, E', 'Villamor, N', 'Pujades, A', 'Sierra, J', 'Feliu, E', 'Vives-Corrons, J L', 'Montserrat, E', 'Rozman, C']","['Urbano-Ispizua A', 'Cervantes F', 'Matutes E', 'Villamor N', 'Pujades A', 'Sierra J', 'Feliu E', 'Vives-Corrons JL', 'Montserrat E', 'Rozman C']","['Postgraduate School of Haematology, Farreras Valenti, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Sep;7(9):1349-54.,,,,,,,,,,

In the normal donor control group the effect of non-IL-2-activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) against blast cells was always lower than 10% lysis, which we have taken as a lower limit for positive results. In 95% of post-CT patients, the lytic effect of PBMC was negative. LAK cells produced positive results in 82% of normal donors and in 37.5% of post-CT patients. The effect of PBMC against K562, i.e. natural killer (NK) activity, in post-CT patients as well as in post-ABMT patients was reduced in comparison with the average for normal donors. LAK cells from 25% of post-CT patients had no notable activity against K562 or Raji, nor was there any positive effect against autologous blast cells. In the rest (75%), one-half generated positive activity. We did not observe any correlation between lytic activity in PBMCs or in LAK cells, nor did we observe significant differences between lytic activity in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and those with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), or between patients who had undergone CT and those receiving ABMTs.

The complete response of one patient to rhEPO and partial responses of two other patients were accompanied by shifts to larger proportions of low density (young) RBC. In vitro phagocytosis of density-fractionated RBC from the complete responder was similar to those of age-matched non-anemic donors. Elevated erythrophagocytosis prior to rhEPO administration was observed for the partial responders and further increased during treatment in one, suggesting the stimulation of abnormal progenitors producing highly defective erythrocytes. There was no correlation between levels of erythrophagocytosis and RBC membrane-bound immunoglobulins in this group of patients.

Six out of the seven patients responded within four weeks. Three of the responders successfully continued rhEPO treatment 15 months or more. To determine whether it may be possible to predict response to rhEPO, various clinical parameters were examined. Responders were found to be significantly different from non-responders in five aspects: They had less elevated baseline serum EPO levels (92 +/- 33 versus 515 +/- 108 U/l, mean +/- SEM; p = 0.023) and were more often transfusion-independent (71% versus 20% of non-responders; p = 0.022). Furthermore, responders were more often females (71% versus 40% in the non-responding group; p = 0.025), of subtype RA rather than RAEB (four patients and one patient, respectively, compared to seven and nine patients in the non-responding group; p = 0.025), and they predominantly displayed normal karyotypes or a 5q- aberration (86% versus 47%; p = 0.005).

We studied karyotype at diagnosis in 408 cases of de novo MDS (after excluding therapy-related MDS). Karyotypes were classified in 10 groups: normal; isolated del 5q; del 5q and other rearrangements; isolated +8; isolated -7 or del 7q; del 20q; isolated -Y; miscellaneous single rearrangements; -7 or del 7q and other rearrangements; miscellaneous complex rearrangements. Karyotypes were considered complex when at least three chromosomes were rearranged. Complex karyotypes included all patients with del 5q and other rearrangements, -7 or del 7q and other rearrangements, and miscellaneous complex rearrangements (i.e. three of the 10 groups). Median actuarial survival of the 408 patients was 28 months, and 90 patients (22%) progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). For survival, bone marrow (BM) blasts, circulating blasts, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count, platelet count, hemoglobin, age, sex, FAB classification, and Bournemouth and Sanz's scores had strong prognostic value. Cytogenetics also had strong prognostic value. An unfavorable cytogenetic group (patients with complex karyotypes) was identified. On the other hand, although patients with isolated del 20q and del 5q had a somewhat better prognosis than other patients with non-complex cytogenetic findings, they could not be statistically individualized as a favorable group, possibly owing to their relatively limited number. By multivariate regression analysis, a three-variable new scoring system could be designed based on karyotype (1 point for complex karyotype; 0 for other groups), platelets (0 for > 75 x 10(9)/l; 1 for < 75 x 10(9)/l), and BM blasts (0 for < 5%, 1 for 5-10%, 2 for > 10%).

Both pathways were, however, activated by phorbol myristate acetate irrespective of proliferation status. The data here suggest that, unlike inositol lipids, choline lipids are not a source of second messenger molecules with potential roles in the regulation of HL60 cell proliferation.","['Wickremasinghe, R G', 'Porfiri, E', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Wickremasinghe RG', 'Porfiri E', 'Hoffbrand AV']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital Medical School, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '4L6452S749 (Inositol)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'N91BDP6H0X (Choline)']",IM,"['Choline/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylcholines/*metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(93)90110-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(93)90110-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1993 Sep;17(9):763-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(93)90110-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Only 4 of the 63 patients progressed to another FAB type within 5 yr of diagnosis, from RA to refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). After 5 yr, 9 patients showed progression (including progression to AML in 5 patients). The other patients remained stable (43 cases) or died from cytopenias or unrelated disorders (11 cases). Except for 3 patients who achieved prolonged complete remission with intensive chemotherapy, and possibly 3 patients who responded to low dose Ara C, prolonged survival seemed to result mainly from the low natural course of the disease. Although, as expected, significant differences for age, cytopenias, circulating and bone marrow blasts, and karyotype were seen between short (< 2 yr) and long (> 5 yr) very few significant differences were seen between intermediate and long survivors.

PTHrP is overexpressed in lymphocytes from adult T-cell leukemia patients. We now demonstrate that in the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I-transformed cell line MT-2, RNA synthesis is initiated primarily at the P2 promoter. Furthermore, in cotransfection experiments, Tax1 transactivates the P2 promoter 10- to 12-fold. By using deletion and site-specific point mutations, we have identified a promoter-proximal sequence (positions -72 to -40) which is important for Tax1 transactivation. The PTHrP promoter-proximal element contains two potential overlapping Ets1 binding sites, EBS I and EBS II. Gel shift analysis demonstrated that Ets1 binds specifically to both EBS I and EBS II. Mutation of the consensus GGAA core motif in EBS I abolished binding and Tax1 transactivation in Jurkat T lymphocytes. In Ets1-deficient cells, cotransfection of Tax1 and Ets1 expression plasmids stimulates PTHrP promoter activity. In the absence of Ets1, minimal transactivation of the PTHrP promoter is observed. These data suggest that Ets1 binds to EBS I and cooperates with Tax1 to transactivate the PTHrP P2 promoter.","['Dittmer, J', 'Gitlin, S D', 'Reid, R L', 'Brady, J N']","['Dittmer J', 'Gitlin SD', 'Reid RL', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'HIV/genetics', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Parathyroid Hormone/genetics', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription Factors', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/10/01 00:00,1993/10/01 00:01,['1993/10/01 00:00'],"['1993/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.10.6087-6095.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Oct;67(10):6087-95. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.10.6087-6095.1993.,,,,,,,,,PMC238030,

These all viruses potentially develop serious, irreversible disease, ie, hepatoma or adult T-cell leukemia, after long latent periods. HBV, HTLV-1 and HCV can be transmitted vertically from carrier mothers to their offspring, and therefore, are serious SVIs in the field of obstetrics. HB immunoglobulin (HBIG) and HB vaccine have been used clinically for the prevention of HBV vertical transmission (VT) under the guidance of the Ministry of Public Welfare in Japan. This nation-wide trial has much contributed to reducing the development of new carriers. However, the protocol recommended by the Ministry is a bit noncost-effective and troublesome for the patients and physicians. To solve the problem we newly designed our own regimen based on the natural history of HBV VT, the neonatal immune response to the recombinant vaccine and cost-effectiveness, and compared it with the Ministry one.

One way cells interact in immune and hemopoietic systems is through soluble mediators called interleukins or cytokines. Many cytokines and their receptors have been identified and characterized at the molecular level. These studies have observed that most cytokines function in a pleiotropic and redundant manner. Receptor studies have shown that many cytokine receptors consist of two polypeptide chains, a ligand-binding receptor, and a nonbinding signal transducer. This arrangement may explain the pleiotropic and redundant effects of cytokines. For example, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and IL-6 share many biological activities including platelet production, and the receptors of these cytokines utilize gp130 as a common signal transducer. IL-6 is multifunctional and produces both favorable and unfavorable effects on human health. Dysregulation of IL-6 expression is linked to the occurrence of cancer and autoimmune diseases, such as multiple myeloma, Castleman's disease, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Studies in transgenic mice in which the IL-6 gene was overexpressed have confirmed these pathogenic actions of IL-6. The pathogenesis of these diseases and therapies to treat them are discussed here based on insights derived from cytokine research.","['Kishimoto, T']",['Kishimoto T'],"['Department of Internal Medicine III, Osaka University Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai zasshi,7505749,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Autoimmune Diseases/etiology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'C-Reactive Protein/biosynthesis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Liver/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms/etiology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Sanka Fujinka Gakkai Zasshi. 1993 Aug;45(8):724-34.,,,,,,0,,,,

We examined the therapeutic effect of MRK-20 (IgG1), a murine monoclonal antibody against resistance-associated 85-kDa membrane protein. The 85-kDa protein is expressed on the surface of multidrug-resistant cells induced by adriamycin. This protein is also expressed in some multiple-drug-resistant cells, including atypical multidrug-resistant cells. The protein, once lost during long-term culture without adriamycin, was rapidly induced by treatment with adriamycin but not with vinblastine or etoposide, suggesting a close relationship of the protein with adriamycin resistance but not with multidrug resistance. The antibody MRK-20 suppressed the growth of subcutaneously implanted tumors expressing the 85-kDa protein. Adriamycin-resistant human ovarian tumor 2780AD and innately resistant human erythroleukemia HEL cells in athymic mice were completely cured by treatment with MRK-20 antibody when the antibody was administered i.v. 2 days after s.c. tumor implantation. On the other hand, MRK-20 did not show any effect on the growth of the 85-kDa protein-negative A2780 human ovarian tumor. These results indicate that the effect of MRK-20 is highly specific to cells expressing 85-kDa protein.","['Ishii, S', 'Naito, M', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Ishii S', 'Naito M', 'Tsuruo T']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/immunology/pathology/*therapy']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02043.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Jul;84(7):776-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02043.x.,,,,,,,,,PMC5919210,

Previously we have succeeded in generating monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against rabbit CD4, CD5 and CD11a antigens. To make this animal species more amenable to cellular and molecular studies, we have attempted to extend the panel of mAbs against rabbit CD antigens. Here we report on the generation of three neutralizing mAbs against interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain (IL-2R alpha) (CD25), Kei-alpha 1 (IgG2b), Kei-alpha 2 (IgG2a) and Kei-alpha 3 (IgG1). They specifically recognize the rabbit Mr 55,000 IL-2 binding protein, IL-2R alpha, and completely inhibit both high- and low-affinity IL-2 binding to F648b cells that express IL-2R alpha as well as IL-2R beta. The use of mAb Kei-alpha 1 confirmed that the rabbit IL-2R alpha is not only a low-affinity IL-2R on its own but also an essential component of high-affinity IL-2R as found in other animal species, and that rabbit activated T cells including HTLV-1-transformed cell lines express high levels of the IL-2R alpha. Together with mAbs against various rabbit CD antigens that we reported previously, these neutralizing mAbs to IL-2R alpha will be valuable for studies of human retrovirus infections, such as those induced by HTLV-1 or HIV, in rabbits.","['Kotani, M', 'Yamamura, Y', 'Tsudo, M', 'Tamatani, T', 'Kitamura, F', 'Miyasaka, M']","['Kotani M', 'Yamamura Y', 'Tsudo M', 'Tamatani T', 'Kitamura F', 'Miyasaka M']","['Department of Immunology, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02042.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1993 Jul;84(7):770-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1993.tb02042.x.,,,,,,,,,PMC5919206,

Under optimal conditions, these retinoids caused a doubling of the population of hemin-induced differentiated cells. In addition, co-treatment of cells with hemin and retinoid led to longer maintenance of the differentiated state after the removal of hemin, which might imply acquisition of irreversibility of hemin-induced differentiation.

In contrast, the growth pattern in peripheral blood cultures from the same patients varied widely according to the subtype of ALL: whereas in patients with undifferentiated ALL [TdT+, HLA-DR+, CD19+ or-, CD10-, (n = 4) or CD7+, CD5+, CD1-, CD4- and CD8- (n = 1)] PB had strongly reduced proliferative capacity compared with control (p < 0.05), there was excess growth of normal neutrophil and erythroid colonies in BP cultures from patients with a more mature immunophenotype of either B-[CD10+, (n = 11)] or T [CD1+, CD4+ and/or CD8+, (n = 3)] phenotype. This phenomenon was only seen in patients who had circulating lymphoblasts: If their number was low, growth was so prolific that single colonies could not be identified.

The production of this cytokine was examined using a hepatocyte-stimulating factor activity assay and confirmed by the use of neutralizing antibodies specific for LIF. This production was enhanced by treatment with the calcium ionophore A23187. No interleukin-6 production was observed by these cells either endogenously or following ionophore activation.

In Fd-MIV infection, the ability of lymphoid cells to produce both IL-2 and TNF-alpha was suppressed. The suppression of these cytokines coincided with the suppression of the primary antibody response. In contrast to FLC infection, the production of IL-6 was elevated. Furthermore, increased production of TGF-beta was found in unstimulated splenocytes from Fd-MIV-infected mice.

Apropos of 7 cases].,243-50,"Seven patients suffering from hypereosinophilic syndrome with clinical and/or hematological symptoms of a myeloproliferative syndrome were treated with a combination of hydroxyurea and interferon-alpha. To date, 6 of them have been followed for more than 1 year. In all cases, this therapy decreased circulating hypereosinophilia to under 1,500/mm3 and obtained normal eosinophil levels in 5 patients with a parallel regression of visceral complications. None of the patients experienced treatment-associated side effects, particularly hematological ones. Hypereosinophilic syndrome has a poor prognosis due, for the most part, to the development of visceral, cardiac and neurological complications, and, more secondarily, to the risk of progression towards acute leukemia. Conventional treatments, corticosteroids and hydroxyurea, have greatly improved the prognosis, but failure of these therapeutics remains common in the myeloproliferative form of the disease. Because interferon-alpha was proven to effectively treat chronic myeloid leukemia, it has been proposed for the treatment of hypereosinophilic syndromes, and encouraging results have been obtained despite the high daily doses required to control the disease. In the future, its association with hydroxyurea could represent an alternative therapy capable of controlling the disease at low doses thereby limiting the risk of side effects.","['Coutant, G', 'Bletry, O', 'Prin, L', 'Hauteville, D', 'de Puyfontaine, O', 'Abgrall, J F', 'Godeau, P']","['Coutant G', 'Bletry O', 'Prin L', 'Hauteville D', 'de Puyfontaine O', 'Abgrall JF', 'Godeau P']","['Service de Medecine Interne, Hopital de la Pitie, Paris.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Annales de medecine interne,0171744,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Eosinophilia/complications/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Prognosis']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Med Interne (Paris). 1993;144(4):243-50.,,,,,,31,,Traitement des syndromes hypereosinophiliques a expression myeloproliferative par l'association hydroxyuree-interferon alpha.

The growing wealth of detail about the nature of the interaction of these receptors with regulatory sites in the genome is discussed. Finally, we have described our results with lines of tissue culture cells representing clones from a typical leukemia of the young, and of myeloma, a typical hematologic malignancy of the elderly.

Our finding of the p21X mRNA being constitutively expressed in the fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with ATL has suggested that the expression mechanism is quite different from that of the others. In this paper, the expression mechanism of p21X mRNA was investigated by analyzing the organization of the proviral genomes present in the representative HTLV-1-infected cell lines which are positive or negative for the expression of p21X mRNA. Southern and PCR analyses show that most of the analyzed cell lines contain both one complete and one defective genome each. However, one cell line without the p21X mRNA expression, C91/PL, contains only the complete genome, suggesting that the complete HTLV-1 has no ability to express p21X mRNA in spite of having the ability to produce the infectious virus. The defective genomes of the p21X mRNA positive cell lines, MT-2 and H582, have a large deletion of the entire pol and parts of the gag and env regions including the common domain of the second exon of the doubly spliced tax/rex mRNA, while another defective genome of the p21X mRNA negative cell line, MT-1, has a deletion within the gag-pol gene. We show that these defective genomes have the ability to express their distinct, defective genomic mRNA, suggesting they are active. The defective genomic mRNAs in MT-2 and H582 cells retain the first splice donor and the second splice acceptor sites, suggesting the possibility of synthesizing p21X mRNA by splicing singly with these sites. These findings assume that defective HTLV-1 genomes deleting the second exon region acquire the ability to express p21X mRNA but no ability to express tax/rex mRNA. Such a deletion may explain the difference between the expression mechanisms in the p21X mRNA transcript and those in the other viral transcripts.","['Orita, S', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Aono, Y', 'Saiga, A', 'Maeda, M', 'Igarashi, H']","['Orita S', 'Kobayashi H', 'Aono Y', 'Saiga A', 'Maeda M', 'Igarashi H']","['Shionogi Institute for Medical Science, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (p21X protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', '*Genes, env', '*Genes, pol', 'Genome, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/microbiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",1993/08/11 00:00,1993/08/11 00:01,['1993/08/11 00:00'],"['1993/08/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/11 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/21.16.3799 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1993 Aug 11;21(16):3799-807. doi: 10.1093/nar/21.16.3799.,,,"['env', 'pol', 'rex', 'tax']",['GENBANK/D14335'],,,,,PMC309895,

We have developed a differential polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, in which the N-myc target gene is co-amplified with a control gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Following electrophoresis, a ratio between the two PCR products within a given DNA sample is then determined by densitometry. This assay was applied to DNA isolated from 32 primary neuroblastoma tumours for which the N-myc status had previously been determined by Southern analysis. Following PCR, samples containing a single copy of the N-myc oncogene were clearly distinguishable from samples with N-myc gene amplification, based on an N-myc/GAPDH ratio of below or above 1.0, respectively. Linear regression indicated a highly significant relationship (R = 0.94; P < 0.0001) between N-myc copy number (Southern) and N-myc/GAPDH ratio (PCR). Serial dilution of N-myc amplified DNA with non-amplified control DNA indicated that the PCR assay was sufficiently sensitive to detect two-fold amplification. Moreover, such serial dilution allowed determination of N-myc copy number. The assay, which requires only small amounts of tissue and does not utilize 32P-radioactivity, therefore provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to Southern analysis.","['Gilbert, J', 'Norris, M D', 'Haber, M', 'Kavallaris, M', 'Marshall, G M', 'Stewart, B W']","['Gilbert J', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Kavallaris M', 'Marshall GM', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, Sydney, N.S.W., Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 1.2.1.- (Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/genetics', '*Gene Amplification', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases/analysis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroblastoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0890-8508(83)71033-9 [pii]', '10.1006/mcpr.1993.1033 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 1993 Jun;7(3):227-34. doi: 10.1006/mcpr.1993.1033.,,,"['GAPDH', 'N-myc']",,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to establish an algorithm for transformation of empirical rules into mathematical values to achieve proper decisions. Recognition of leukaemia phenotype was performed by comparison of phenotyping data with reference data, followed by scoring of such comparisons. Systematic scoring resulted in the formation of new numerical variables allocated to each state, whereas a most significant variable was described as a complex measure of compatibility. A system of recognized states was described by mathematical variables measuring the confidence of information systems, i.e. maximal, total and relative entropy. The entire algorithm was derived by matrix algebra and coded in a high-level program language. The list of the states recognized appeared to be especially helpful in differential diagnosis, occasionally pointing to states that had not been in the scientist's mind at the start of the analysis.","['Petrovecki, M', 'Marusic, M', 'Dezelic, G']","['Petrovecki M', 'Marusic M', 'Dezelic G']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory Diagnosis, Zagreb Clinical Center, Croatia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Inform (Lond),Medical informatics = Medecine et informatique,7612096,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Databases, Bibliographic', '*Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/classification/*diagnosis/immunology', '*Software']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/14639239309034464 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Inform (Lond). 1993 Jan-Mar;18(1):11-21. doi: 10.3109/14639239309034464.,,,,,,,,,,

Initial age and leukocyte counts were of no value in predicting late-relapse. The relapse rate in cases initially treated by the VPL regimen was twice that of those by a multi-drug regimen. A second prolonged remission was achieved in 5 of 10 cases by combinations of intensive chemotherapy (modified HEX) and irradiation to the testes or CNS. On the contrary, all late relapse patients initially treated by the multi-drug chemotherapy had a poor outcome. More intensive chemotherapy, including high-dose chemoradiotherapy and bone marrow transplantation, should be employed in this group of patients.","['Ikuta, K', 'Fujioka, K', 'Takahashi, H', 'Sumita, H', 'Sekiguchi, H', 'Hanzawa, N', 'Kai, S', 'Kajigaya, Y', 'Funabiki, T', 'Okuyama, T']","['Ikuta K', 'Fujioka K', 'Takahashi H', 'Sumita H', 'Sekiguchi H', 'Hanzawa N', 'Kai S', 'Kajigaya Y', 'Funabiki T', 'Okuyama T', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University, School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1993 Jun;34(6):712-7.,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of EBV-infected B cell line cells as feeder cells resulted in better production of gamma/delta-1+ and non-T cell clones than that of WT31+ clones. One typical example of the cloning from lymphoblastic lymphoma cell-predominant PBMC resulted in the production of 8 gamma/delta-1+ and 3 WT31+ clones.

The original term, necrosis, is now reserved for the generally destructive series of events which include the release of lysosomal enzymes and loss of cell membrane integrity. In contrast, mild treatment with cell damaging agents, or withdrawal of growth factors, may result in a characteristic form of degradation of cellular DNA which is associated with cell death that has morphology known as apoptosis. In this study human leukemia cells were exposed to agents or conditions previously reported to cause necrosis or apoptosis, monitored by detection of DNA ""ladders,"" and the integrity of cellular DNA was determined on Southern blots. Nuclear DNA was distinguished from mitochondrial DNA by use of probes specific for nuclear genes or for mitochondrial DNA. When HL60, K562, MOLT4, or U937 cells were exposed to conditions which resulted in necrosis, mitochondrial DNA was damaged at approximately the same rate as nuclear DNA, but in apoptosis mtDNA was not degraded. Thus, the ratio of the relative (to untreated cells) abundance of mitochondrial DNA measured by a probe for 16S mitochondrial ribosomal RNA on Southern blots, to the relative abundance of DNA of any nuclear gene, was 1 or less in necrosis, but rose to values greater than 2 in apoptosis. It is concluded that the comparison of the degree of fragmentation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA provides a quantitative way of distinguishing necrosis from apoptosis.","['Tepper, C G', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Tepper CG', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240520311 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1993 Jul;52(3):352-61. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240520311.,['CA-44722-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Using differentiated murine erythroleukemic cells, we have investigated the association between band 3 (a major transmembrane anion exchanger), and ankyrin (a cytoplasmic protein that links band 3 to the cytoskeleton). Our data demonstrate that the association between band 3 and ankyrin occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum or the first Golgi compartment. These data support a model in which the band 3-ankyrin complex is inserted as a ""cassette"" at the plasma membrane into the cytoskeletal network. Biosynthetic studies on cotransfected 293 cells with cDNAs encoding band 3 and the band 3 binding fragment of ankyrin (AnK-90), suggest that ankyrin is not only responsible for the anchorage of band 3 to the cytoskeleton but is also involved in the exit of band 3 out of the endoplasmic reticulum.","['Gomez, S', 'Morgans, C']","['Gomez S', 'Morgans C']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Stanford University, California 94305-5020.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte)', '0 (Ankyrins)', '0 (Sulfur Radioisotopes)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anion Exchange Protein 1, Erythrocyte/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ankyrins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microsomes/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Binding', 'Sulfur Radioisotopes', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)36557-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 15;268(26):19593-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Both the incorporation of [14C]uridine into UTP and CTP and the incorporation of [14C]cytidine in CTP, as well as the fluxes of these labeled nucleosides through the nucleotide pools into nucleic acids, were elevated in proliferating MOLT-3 cells compared to proliferating T lymphocytes. Furthermore, the conversion of UTP into CTP was enhanced in proliferating MOLT-3 cells compared to proliferating T lymphocytes, indicating a higher activity of CTP synthetase in the leukemic cells. In non-proliferating MOLT-3 cells, the pyrimidine ribonucleotide fluxes were decreased compared to proliferating MOLT-3 cells and proliferating T lymphocytes. However, the decreased ratio of uracil/cytosine ribonucleotides that was found in proliferating T lymphocytes and proliferating MOLT-3 cells compared to non-proliferating blood lymphocytes, was preserved in the differentiated MOLT-3 cells. Moreover, although the fluxes had decreased, most CTP was still synthesized by CTP synthetase in the differentiated MOLT-3 cells. Thus, the elevated activity of CTP synthetase in MOLT-3 cells was independent of the cell growth and maturation stage. We conclude that the increased activity of CTP synthetase is associated with the process of malignant transformation in MOLT-3 cells. Therefore, CTP synthetase offers an attractive target for selective therapy in human acute T-lymphoid leukemia.","['van den Berg, A A', 'van Lenthe, H', 'Busch, S', 'de Korte, D', 'Roos, D', 'van Kuilenburg, A B', 'van Gennip, A H']","['van den Berg AA', 'van Lenthe H', 'Busch S', 'de Korte D', 'Roos D', 'van Kuilenburg AB', 'van Gennip AH']","['Academic Medical Center, Division of Pediatrics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Pyrimidine Nucleotides)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)', 'EC 6.- (Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases)', 'EC 6.3.4.2 (CTP synthetase)', 'UT0S826Z60 (Uridine Triphosphate)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['*Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/pathology', 'Ligases/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Nucleotides/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism', 'Uridine Triphosphate/metabolism']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18128.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1993 Aug 15;216(1):161-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1993.tb18128.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of such variation has been assessed by monitoring molecular and cellular processes induced by etoposide (VP-16) in the human lymphoblastoid T-cell lines CCRF-CEM (CEM) and MOLT-4 contrasted, where appropriate, with those induced by necrotizing injury. Cytotoxic concentrations of the drug were determined to be 5-100 microM on the basis of tetrazolium reduction assay. The two lines were equally sensitive to VP-16; no difference in concentration of drug which inhibited cell growth by 50% with respect to control (i.e., drug free) cultures was apparent irrespective of exposure times from 3-72 h. DNA strand breaks were evident in both populations within 3 h of exposure to VP-16. Morphological change, assessed microscopically, involving nuclear condensation and cell shrinkage was qualitatively and quantitatively similar in VP-16-treated CEM and MOLT-4 cells. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that the G2/M fraction of the randomly dividing MOLT-4 population was approximately one-third that of CEM cells, but each line exhibited a decrease in this fraction 3-6 h after treatment. Despite these similarities, marked differences in the response to VP-16 were evident in the two populations. Internucleosomal fragmentation, detected electrophoretically 3 h after treatment in DNA isolated from CEM cells, was not detected under any condition in MOLT-4 DNA. Apoptotic bodies, also evident within 3 h of VP-16 treatment of CEM cells, were not readily apparent in MOLT-4 cells under the same conditions. Treatment causing necrosis resulted in trypan blue uptake within 1 h in a similar high proportion of cells from both lines. Exposure to VP-16 resulted in such a loss of membrane integrity by 6 h in CEM cells, while change in this parameter occurred only after 24 h in the case of MOLT-4 cells. The findings indicate a wide scope of difference in apoptotic response and suggest delayed loss of membrane permeability, rather than DNA fragmentation, as the clearest indicator of programmed cell death in these populations.","['Catchpoole, D R', 'Stewart, B W']","['Catchpoole DR', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, University of New South Wales, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I2ZWO3LS3M (Trypan Blue)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Trypan Blue/pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 15;53(18):4287-96.,,,,,,,,,,

Antitumor protection was significantly greater than that afforded by treatment with either cytokine alone. Since neither IL-2 receptors nor M-CSF receptors were expressed on EL4, the antitumor effect was likely attributed to murine effector cells. To determine how M-CSF+IL-2 provided this effect, we performed immunophenotypic and functional analyses as well as in vivo depletion studies of putative antitumor effector cells. Splenic phenotyping experiments revealed that the highest levels of macrophages and natural killer cells were observed in mice given the cytokine combination rather than either M-CSF or IL-2 alone. In vivo depletion of natural killer cells ablated the antitumor protective effect of M-CSF and IL-2. T-cells were also important for M-CSF+IL-2 efficacy, since adult thymectomy/T-cell depletion significantly inhibited the ability of cytokine coadministration to protect against EL4. Coadministration of the 2 cytokines significantly elevated in vivo levels of CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD8+, CD3+NK1.1+ T-cells, and CD3+CD25+ (activated) T-cells, and elevated anti-EL4 cytotoxic T-cell activity measured in vitro. Although WBC counts and fluorescence-activated cell sorter studies showed that M-CSF+IL-2 treatment significantly elevated neutrophils, s.c. delivery of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor at doses sufficient to induce neutrophilia was unable to confer anti-EL4 protection. These studies indicate that macrophages, T-cells, and natural killer cells are all important in the M-CSF+IL-2 anti-EL4 response. The superior antitumor effect of this cytokine combination along with the ability of M-CSF to diminish the toxicity of IL-2 in this model suggests that further investigations into the clinical potential of this combination treatment are warranted.","['Vallera, D A', 'Taylor, P A', 'Aukerman, S L', 'Blazar, B R']","['Vallera DA', 'Taylor PA', 'Aukerman SL', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunotherapy', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage']",1993/09/15 00:00,1993/09/15 00:01,['1993/09/15 00:00'],"['1993/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 15;53(18):4273-80.,"['P01-CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Previous studies suggested an association between t(11;14) chromosomal translocations and BCL-1 rearrangements.

We used various probes covering a considerable proportion of the 120-kilobase BCL-1 locus, and rearrangements in 50% of CC/IDL (10 of 20) were detected. In CC, all 4 breakpoints were located at the major translocation cluster (MTC). In contrast, in IDL, rearrangements were detected in 3 different cluster regions: 2 cases in the MTC, 2 cases with a breakpoint 24 kilobases outside the MTC, and 2 additional cases with breakpoints found 3 kilobases 5' of the first exon of the PRAD1/CCND1 gene, which is located 120 kilobases outside the MTC.

This gene, in conjunction with others, plays a pivotal role in eliciting the T cell-mediated immune response. We have investigated the promoter and exon 1 region, the nucleotide -300 to +300 region of this gene relative to the position of transcriptional initiation at nucleotide +1, particularly with respect to the extent of DNA methylation at the 5'-CG-3' sequences and its changes upon induction. By using RNA transfer analyses and the in vivo footprinting technique, we have confirmed the previously reported finding that, upon stimulation of lymphocytes by phytohemagglutinin (PHA) plus interleukin-2 (IL-2), the IL-2R alpha gene can be induced to be transcribed. The region of the IL-2R alpha gene analyzed for 5'-CG-3' methylation by the genomic sequencing method or a polymerase chain reaction-based method subsequent to HpaII or HhaI cleavage of the DNA does not seem to be significantly methylated in most cell types tested, except for the cytidine residue in position +198 which is partly methylated. In the DNA of cells from a chronic B cell lymphatic leukemia 5'-CCGG-3' sequences in the exon 1 region are almost completely unmethylated. These results suggest that the promoter of a gene that is crucial in promoting the immune response and may have to be activated momentarily, will not be silenced by a long-term mechanism like DNA methylation.

In experiments in mice we have shown that carboplatin-liposomes injected intraperitoneally in a single dose of 100 mg/kg led to a strong two-peak increase in white blood cell counts. A maximum 10-fold elevation compared to controls of free carboplatin or empty liposomes was observed on day 2 and was probably due to the release and mobilization of cells from storage compartments. The second peak of about a 6-fold increase occurred on day 7-8 and can be seen as an indicator of bone marrow stimulation. Differentiation of blood cells revealed that neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets multiplied. We presume that this effect of carboplatin-liposomes is due to a relatively fast uptake of these vesicles by macrophages as their natural target. Within these cells carboplatin is metabolized, leading to an almost total loss of antineoplastic activity against the murine P388 leukemia. Concomitantly, cytokines are apparently induced in and released from macrophages producing secondarily hematopoietic growth factors either directly or in combination with other cytokines. An involvement of macrophages is indicated by the fact that an intraperitoneal pretreatment of mice with zymosan caused a partial but significant suppression of hematopoietic stimulation. In an in vitro colony forming assay of serum of mice treated 1, 3, or 7 days with carboplatin-liposomes, the number of colonies increased 20-fold compared to serum from saline treated animals. Additionally, a combined intraperitoneal treatment of mice with 100 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide followed by carboplatin-liposomes one hour later demonstrated that prevention of cytostatic-induced leukopenia is possible by this method. Although the mechanism of stimulation of hematopoiesis by carboplatin-liposomes is still partially unknown our results suggest that there should be further development of such a preparation for possible use in the treatment of cancer or other inherited or acquired hematopoietic disorders.","['Fichtner, I', 'Reszka, R', 'Schutt, M', 'Rudolph, M', 'Becker, M', 'Lemm, M', 'Richter, J', 'Berger, I']","['Fichtner I', 'Reszka R', 'Schutt M', 'Rudolph M', 'Becker M', 'Lemm M', 'Richter J', 'Berger I']","['Max-Delbruck-Center of Molecular Medicine, Berlin-Buch, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carboplatin/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Carriers', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Macrophages/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'Stimulation, Chemical']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1993;5(2):65-74.,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that there are multiple intracellular sites of action which include ribonucleotide reductase and DNA polymerase. In these studies, the effects of dFdCyd on wild-type mouse leukemia L1210 cells and variant L1210 cell lines which had alterations at the ribonucleotide reductase site or at the deoxyribonucleoside kinase site were studied. For cell growth, the IC50 value for dFdCyd in wild-type L1210 cells was 3.1 nM. In the variant cell lines, the IC50 values were: hydroxyurea-resistant (HU), 3.3 nM; deoxyadenosine-resistant (Y8), 1.8 nM; pyrazoloimidazole/deoxyadenosine-resistant (ED2), 1.9 nM; and deoxyguanosine-resistant (dGuo-R), 44.7 nM. The dGuo-R cell line had a relatively specific loss of the deoxyribonucleoside kinase responsible for phosphorylating deoxyguanosine and cytosine arabinoside with little loss of the deoxycytidine kinase activity. DFdCyd had no effect on the total uptake of [14C]cytidine into the cells or incorporation into RNA. DFdCyd inhibited the conversion of [14C]cytidine to deoxycytidine nucleotides and incorporation into DNA. However, the incorporation of cytidine into DNA was inhibited to a greater extent than was the inhibition of in situ ribonucleotide reductase activity. Ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free extracts prepared from L1210 cells treated with dFdCyd (20 nM) overnight was reduced by 50%. These results show that cell lines which have increased levels of ribonucleotide reductase activity (HU and ED2) or loss of feedback inhibition by dATP (ED2 and Y8) are still sensitive to dFdCyd. The findings indicate that ribonucleotide reductase is not the primary site of inhibition by dFdCyd.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Cory, A H', 'Hertel, L W', 'Kroin, J S', 'Cory, J G']","['Cory AH', 'Hertel LW', 'Kroin JS', 'Cory JG']","['Department of Biochemistry, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncol Res,Oncology research,9208097,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cytidine/metabolism', 'Deoxycytidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Res. 1993;5(2):59-63.,['CA-42070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The nucleotide sequences of VH3.P103 and V lambda IV.P87 could not be reliably matched with reported germline V genes. The analysis of multiple independently obtained VH and VL cDNA clones from each tumor showed a lack of intraclonal diversification.

BM aspirates were serially investigated after obtention of a complete response. When sensitivity was less than 1:10(4), the PCR fragment was sequenced and a specific oligonucleotide was synthetized and used as a probe (five cases). Cases in which minimal residual disease (MRD) became undetectable were cross-controlled using either TCR delta rearrangement or a specific translocation to circumvent the problem of false-negative results arising from clonal evolution. The median follow-up was 30 months (3 to 51 months). Within the first 3 months of complete remission, MRD was detectable in 22 of 23 investigated patients and remained so in 19 of 21 patients examined at 6 months, regardless of the long-term clinical outcome. In patients remaining in complete remission at 30 months or more, two patterns of MRD emerged during the follow-up. Either it continuously decreased to ultimately become undetectable (five patients) or remained detectable (five patients) with an increase after discontinuation of treatment in two. In the eight patients who relapsed, MRD persisted throughout the clinical course, and eventually increased 3 to 12 months before relapse was clinically detectable. In one case, clonal evolution of the VDJ heavy chain region was observed and recurrence of MRD shown by the use of TCR delta rearrangement as a control. We conclude that the use of this simplified methodology is a valuable tool for the follow-up of MRD in a majority of ALL patients, though in a few cases, sequencing needs to be performed to achieve a relevant sensitivity. The possibility of clonal evolution requires a cross-control of any sample becoming negative whatever the initial rearrangement used to generate a probe. In patients on therapy, sequential search for MRD seems to be a good tool for predicting the long-term outcome. In addition, patients remaining positive at the time treatment is discontinued or with a high tumor burden after a few months therapy may be at a higher risk of subsequent relapse, although a longer follow-up is needed to answer this question.","['Nizet, Y', 'Van Daele, S', 'Lewalle, P', 'Vaerman, J L', 'Philippe, M', 'Vermylen, C', 'Cornu, G', 'Ferrant, A', 'Michaux, J L', 'Martiat, P']","['Nizet Y', 'Van Daele S', 'Lewalle P', 'Vaerman JL', 'Philippe M', 'Vermylen C', 'Cornu G', 'Ferrant A', 'Michaux JL', 'Martiat P']","['Department of Hematology, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Probes/*analysis', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*physiopathology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78403-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 1;82(5):1618-25.,,,['IgH'],,,,,,,

The lysis, assessed by 51Cr release, was found to be selective for ATP, because adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or other nucleotides were less effective in their ability to lyse the cells. The amount of 51Cr released was particularly enhanced by the stimulation of the cells with 1,000 U/mL of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) for 3 days, and the sensitivity was time and dose dependent. Analysis of the mechanism of lysis indicated that the fully ionized form, ATP4-, mediated the lysis, because the addition of cation chelators or the absence of the divalent cations, Ca2+ and Mg2+, in the culture medium of a 6-hour 51Cr release assay increased the percent specific lysis. Therefore, the ATP receptors on THP-1 cells were classified as P2Z purinoceptors. Moreover, it is shown here that the Ca2+/calmodulin complex plays a role in the regulation of the lysis by extracellular ATP of THP-1 cells, because antagonists of this complex, such as trifluoperazine or KN-62, were found to inhibit the ATP-mediated cell lysis.","['Spranzi, E', 'Djeu, J Y', 'Hoffman, S L', 'Epling-Burnette, P K', 'Blanchard, D K']","['Spranzi E', 'Djeu JY', 'Hoffman SL', 'Epling-Burnette PK', 'Blanchard DK']","['Department of Medical Microbiology & Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, H.

Because neither the T-cell receptor nor cytokine receptors contain intrinsic kinase domains, signal transduction is thought to occur via association of these receptors with intracellular protein tyrosine kinases. Although several members of the SRC and SYK families of tyrosine kinases have been implicated in signal transduction in lymphocytes, it seems likely that additional tyrosine kinases involved in signal transduction remain to be identified. To identify unique T-cell tyrosine kinases, we used polymerase chain reaction-based cloning with degenerate oligonucleotides directed at highly conserved motifs of tyrosine kinase domains. We have cloned the complete cDNA for a unique human tyrosine kinase that is expressed mainly in T lymphocytes (EMT) and natural killer (NK) cells. The cDNA of EMT predicts an open reading frame of 1866 bp encoding a protein with a predicted size of 72 Kd, which is in keeping with its size on Western blotting. A single 6.2-kb EMT mRNA and 72-Kd protein were detected in T lymphocytes and NK-like cell lines, but were not detected in other cell lineages. EMT contains both SH2 and SH3 domains, as do many other intracellular kinases. EMT does not contain the N-terminal myristylation site or the negative regulatory tyrosine phosphorylation site in its carboxyterminus that are found in the SRC family of tyrosine kinases. EMT is related to the B-cell progenitor kinase (BPK), which has recently been implicated in X-linked hypogammaglobulinemia, to the TECI mammalian kinase, which has been implicated in liver neoplasia, to the more widely expressed TECII mammalian kinase, and to the Drosophila melanogaster Dsrc28 kinase. Sequence comparison suggests that EMT is likely the human homologue of a recently identified murine interleukin-2 (IL-2)-inducible T cell kinase (ITK). However, unlike ITK, EMT message and protein levels do not vary markedly on stimulation of human IL-2-responsive T cells with IL-2. Taken together, it seems that EMT is a member of a new family of intracellular kinases that includes BPK, TECI, and TECII. EMT was localized to chromosome 5q31-32, a region that contains the genes for several growth factors and receptors as well as early activation genes, particularly those involved in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, the 5q31-32 region is implicated in the genesis of the 5q- syndrome associated with myelodysplasia and development of leukemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Gibson, S', 'Leung, B', 'Squire, J A', 'Hill, M', 'Arima, N', 'Goss, P', 'Hogg, D', 'Mills, G B']","['Gibson S', 'Leung B', 'Squire JA', 'Hill M', 'Arima N', 'Goss P', 'Hogg D', 'Mills GB']","['Oncology Research Division, Toronto General Hospital, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*enzymology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*chemistry/*genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*enzymology/physiology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)78396-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Sep 1;82(5):1561-72.,,,,,,,,,,

In myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), H2O2 production was also reduced, but no significant difference was observed among FAB classification disease types in MDS patients. In untreated acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), H2O2 production was reduced, while in the complete remission stage of ANLL, its level was normal, suggesting recovery from normal clones. In aplastic anemia, the H2O2 production level was normal. Steroid therapy might be responsible for the reduction of H2O2 production in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The production of H2O2 is closely related to the oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity of neutrophils, and, hence, can be utilized as an index to indicate susceptibility to infection. This neutrophil function can be determined easily in ordinary clinical facilities by using flow cytometry, and care should be taken to prevent infection when H2O2 production is reduced.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Tsurumi, H', 'Shimazaki, M', 'Takahashi, T', 'Moriwaki, H', 'Muto, Y']","['Tsurumi H', 'Shimazaki M', 'Takahashi T', 'Moriwaki H', 'Muto Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)'],IM,"['Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Diseases/*blood', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism']",1993/06/01 00:00,1993/06/01 00:01,['1993/06/01 00:00'],"['1993/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol. 1993 Jun;57(3):213-9.,,,,,,,,,,

The heterogenous sugar moieties of glycoproteins are assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum and in the Golgi and are implicated in many roles that require further elucidation. Glycoprotein-bound oligosaccharides show significant changes in their structures and relative occurrences during growth, development, and differentiation. Diverse alterations of these carbohydrate chains occur in diseases such as cancer, metastasis, leukemia, inflammatory, and other diseases. Structural alterations may correlate with activities of glycosyltransferases that assemble glycans, but often the biochemical origin of these changes remains unclear. This suggests a multitude of biosynthetic control mechanisms that are functional in vivo but have not yet been unraveled by in vitro studies. The multitude of carbohydrate alterations observed in disease states may not be the primary cause but may reflect the growth and biochemical activity of the affected cell.

The induced increase in RB protein per cell occurred early, by 8 h of treatment, preceding any significant phenotypic differentiation evidenced by cellular expression of the CD41 differentiation-specific megakaryocytic cell surface marker, but not inhibition of cell cycle transit, leading to a cell population arrested with 2 n, 4 n, and 8 n DNA content. The increase in RB protein per cell occurred for cells in all cell cycle phases. Staurosporine (STSP) was found to induce a similar course of cell cycle arrest and differentiation. Furthermore, STSP caused an up-regulation of RB expression similar to that caused by TPA. Almost all of the RB protein is phosphorylated in untreated cells, but TPA and STSP both caused the late appearance of hypophosphorylated RB protein following cell cycle arrest. The STSP-caused hypophosphorylation was much later than the TPA effect. Hypophosphorylation of RB is, thus, not necessarily a prerequisite for cell cycle arrest but may be a consequence of G0. Given that TPA can be an activator and STSP an inhibitor of protein kinase C, it appears that the induced processes of tumor suppressor gene regulation and growth and differentiation control are not necessarily protein kinase C dependent in K562 cells. Furthermore, the findings that these two presumably divergent inducing agents caused a similar increase in RB gene expression suggests that the up-regulation of RB associated with differentiation is not a coincidence of just one specific inducer but may be a common essential feature of the induced differentiation. The amount of RB protein per cell increased within hours of exposure to TPA or STSP and may have a role in the induced metabolic cascade producing the new phenotype.","['Yen, A', 'Varvayanis, S', 'Platko, J D']","['Yen A', 'Varvayanis S', 'Platko JD']","['Department of Pathology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853-6401.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/genetics', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Jul 1;53(13):3085-91.,,,,,,,['Cancer Res 1993 Sep 1;53(17):4119'],,,

To characterize the properties of the PGA2 transfer system, we examined the status of PGA2 in L-1210 cells with modified cellular glutathione (GSH) levels. PGA2 in the cytosol fraction of the cells existed in its free-form, the GSH conjugate-form and a macromolecule associate-form (protein bound-form). When the GSH level was lowered under culture conditions, the amount of free-form increased while that of the protein bound-form was unchanged. When PGA2-loaded cells were incubated in a salt solution, free- and conjugate-forms were emitted from the cells. A concomitant decrease and increase of protein bound PGA2 in cytosol and nuclei, respectively, were observed. Subsequent studies with isolated cellular fractions revealed that PGA2 bound to cytosolic protein was transported into the nuclear interior in a temperature-dependent manner. The binding of PGA2 to the protein and subsequent transport to the nuclei were inhibited by PGJ2 and 4-hydroxy-cyclopentenone, but not by PGB2, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2 alpha, arachidonic acid or oleic acid. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) and p-chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB) strongly interfered with these transfer processes, suggesting that sulfhydryl components are involved in the transport of PGA2. Subfractionation of cytosol by gel chromatography proved the presence of two proteins (100-150 kDa and 25-35 kDa) that are capable of transporting PGA2 to cell nuclei. Though 40-45 kDa proteins, which correspond to GSH S-transferases, bound to PGA2, they lacked the nuclear transport activities.","['Ohno, K', 'Hirata, M']","['Ohno K', 'Hirata M']","['Shionogi Research Laboratories, Shionogi & Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'K6VT5BDY9E (prostaglandin A2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Prostaglandins A/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/17 00:00,1993/08/17 00:01,['1993/08/17 00:00'],"['1993/08/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/17 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/17 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(93)90552-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(93)90552-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1993 Aug 17;46(4):661-70. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(93)90552-8.,,,,,,,,,,

As the disease progresses, reduced levels of infectious virus correlate with development of specific antibody; reduction in T cell populations, increase in B cells, and decrease in T-cell function also occur. The following immunomodulators were evaluated, listed in the order of their ability to inhibit the FV disease: imexon > MVE-2 > human recombinant IFN-alpha A/D > AS101 > ampligen > AM-3 = oxamisole > ImuVert > bropirimine.

We have previously demonstrated that araG is an effective agent to use for chemoseparation of malignant T lymphoblasts from human bone marrow. When freshly isolated human T leukemia cells or T lymphoblastoid cells were treated with 100 microM araG for 18 hours, up to 6 logs of clonogenic T cells are eliminated without appreciable toxicity to the normal myeloid, erythroid, and megakaryocytoid clonal progenitor cells. We subsequently described studies in a murine model of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in which we tested whether bone marrow contaminated with malignant T cells and purged ex vivo with araG, could reconstitute both the lymphoid and myeloerythroid lineages in the absence of leukemic relapse. The model utilized 6C3HED tumor cells, derived from a Thy 1.2+ malignant murine T cell line, which were shown to cause lethal leukemia in C3H/HeN mice. Intravenous injection of 10(6) 6C3HED cells resulted in 100 percent mortality within 18 days, with autopsy revealing tumor infiltration of multiple organs. Evidence of araG's ability to purge bone marrow of malignant tumor cells without causing significant toxicity to normal marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells was documented in experiments in which 75 percent of lethally irradiated mice receiving transplants of syngeneic bone marrow contaminated with 6C3HED tumor cells and treated ex vivo with 100 mM araG for 18 hours survived for 250 to > 400 days. Reconstitution of the lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid lineages with donor cells in surviving mice was documented. The data presented indicate that araG may effectively purge bone marrow of malignant T cells without irreversible toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells. This purging regimen is recommended for consideration for clinical trials in patients with T cell malignancies undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation and may also be a viable option for T cell depletion as a strategy to prevent graft versus host disease.","['Kurtzberg, J']",['Kurtzberg J'],"['Pediatric Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '0 (Arabinonucleotides)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)', ""72490-81-4 (9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanosine 5'-triphosphate)"", '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleotides/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/06/23 00:00,1993/06/23 00:01,['1993/06/23 00:00'],"['1993/06/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/06/23 00:01 [medline]', '1993/06/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb35870.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1993 Jun 23;685:225-36. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1993.tb35870.x.,"['3R25CA17987-1251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI26054/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Gi1 alpha, Go alpha-1, Go alpha-2, and Gx alpha, were expressed in a limited number of cell lines whereas Gs alpha, Gi2 alpha, and Gi3 alpha were expressed ubiquitously in nearly all cell lines tested. Gi1 alpha was expressed selectively in a pre-T cell line, P30/PHK among lymphoid-lineage cell lines and a myeloblastic cell line, KG-1 among myelomonocytoid cell lines. Go alpha-1 was expressed only in a chronic myelocytic-leukemia cell line, K-562, whereas Go alpha-2 was not expressed in any cell lines tested after ordinary exposure of autoradiography (within 4 days). Gx alpha was expressed abundantly in a rat basophilic-leukemia cell line, RBL-2H3, and expressed in K-562.

Whereas numerous such genes have already been identified in acute T cell leukemias, no candidate gene has yet been identified to play a role in the heterogeneous group of T cell proliferations with a mature phenotype. We here report the molecular cloning of two examples of the rare but recurrent t(X;14) translocation. The first translocation was associated with a benign clonal proliferation in an ataxia telangiectasia patient and the second with a T cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Both translocations implicated the TCR alpha/delta locus and a common breakpoint region on chromosome Xq28. A previously unidentified gene, abnormally transcribed in both T cell proliferations, was characterized in the immediate proximity of the breakpoints. This Xq28 gene has no homology with known sequences, uses a complex alternative splicing pattern and demonstrates two short open reading frames. This gene, named MTCP-1 (Mature T Cell Proliferation-1) is the first candidate gene potentially involved in the leukemogenic process of mature T cell proliferations.","['Stern, M H', 'Soulier, J', 'Rosenzwajg, M', 'Nakahara, K', 'Canki-Klain, N', 'Aurias, A', 'Sigaux, F', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Stern MH', 'Soulier J', 'Rosenzwajg M', 'Nakahara K', 'Canki-Klain N', 'Aurias A', 'Sigaux F', 'Kirsch IR']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie Moleculaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (MTCP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*X Chromosome']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Sep;8(9):2475-83.,,,['MTCP-1'],,,,,,,

The v-abl oncogene of the Abelson murine leukemia virus exhibits a narrow tissue tropism for transformation, almost exclusively forming pre-B-cell tumors, while the v-src oncogene can induce a variety of sarcomas and other tumors. To localize the determinants of the narrow tropism of the v-abl gene, we generated a series of hybrid retroviral genomes containing portions of the v-abl and v-src oncogenes in a Moloney murine leukemia virus backbone. Each virus was tested for transforming activity in NIH3T3 cells; for transforming activity on bone marrow cultures; and for pathogenicity in newborn mice. Many of the hybrid oncogenes carried by these viruses exhibited transforming activity, and demonstrate that the SH2 domain of each oncogene can be utilized by the kinase domain of the other oncogene for that activity. The results further suggest that a portion of the C-terminal region of v-abl is necessary for the pre-B-cell specificity of the oncogene.","['Hevezi, P', 'Alin, K', 'Goff, S P']","['Hevezi P', 'Alin K', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Microbiology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, src', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Sep;8(9):2413-23.,,,"['v-abl', 'v-src']",,,,,,,

To understand the mechanisms of Tax transactivations of the NF-kappa B enhancer and CArG box, the interactions of Tax protein with their binding factors were analysed. Using a DNA affinity precipitation (DNAP) assay, we found here that Tax associates with the DNA sequences of the NF-kappa B site and CArG box. These Tax associations with enhancers were observed only in the presence of a nuclear factor(s) and were equal to the activating capacities of Tax mutants. To identify the nuclear factor(s), we defined conditions under which no Tax binding to the NF-kappa B binding site and CArG box was detected with a nuclear extract of 293T cells. Under these conditions, transfections with cDNAs of the NF-kappa B p50 and serum response factor (SRF) produced a factor(s) that mediated Tax binding to the NF-kappa B site and the CArG box respectively. Furthermore, purified Tax protein interacted with purified NF-kappa B p50 and purified SRF, indicating their direct bindings. These observations indicate that Tax protein associates with enhancer sequences of the NF-kappa B site and CArG box through NF-kappa B p50 and SRF respectively. Previously we demonstrated that Tax interacts with CREB and CREM proteins that bind to the 21-bp enhancer DNA. These results together suggest that indirect binding of Tax to DNA through each enhancer binding protein is a general mechanism for Tax transactivation of transcription.","['Suzuki, T', 'Hirai, H', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Fujita, T', 'Yoshida, M']","['Suzuki T', 'Hirai H', 'Fujisawa J', 'Fujita T', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Serum Response Factor', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1993 Sep;8(9):2391-7.,,,,,,,,,,

Saliva samples were also used to assess the levels of Streptococcus mutans in the mouth. Sensitivity tests were carried out to assess the effect of the cytotoxic agents on the oral flora. All children received prophylactic nystatin and chlorhexidine gluconate mouthrinses four times daily for the whole period of the study. There was significant difference (p < 0.0001) for counts of S. mutans at different treatment stages. Sensitivity tests showed that S. mutans was sensitive to the cytotoxic drug daunorubicin, and this drug was probably responsible for the fall in S. mutans counts. A significant difference was also found in the types of bacteria isolated between the study and reference groups, but there was no change in the composition of the flora in the study group during treatment.

In all age groups and all phenotypes of leukemia, an 11q23 translocation carries a poor prognosis. A major question has been whether one or several genes on band 11q23 are implicated in these leukemias. Previously, we identified the chromosomal breakpoint region in leukemias with the common 11q23 translocations and subsequently cloned a gene named MLL that spans the 11q23 breakpoint. METHODS: We isolated a 0.74-kb BamHI fragment from a complementary DAN (cDNA) clone of the MLL gene. To determine the incidence of MLL rearrangements in patients with 11q23 abnormalities, we analyzed DNA from 61 patients with acute leukemia, 3 cell lines derived from such patients, and 20 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 11q23 aberrations. RESULTS: The 0.74-kb cDNA probe detected DNA rearrangements in the MLL gene in 58 of the patients with leukemia, in the 3 cell lines, and in 3 of the patients with lymphoma. All the breaks occurred in an 8.3-kb breakpoint cluster region within the MLL gene. The probe identified DNA rearrangements in all 48 patients with the five common 11q23 translocations involving chromosomes 4, 6, 9, and 19, as well as in 16 patients with uncommon 11q23 aberrations. Twenty-one different chromosomal breakpoints involving the MLL gene were detected. CONCLUSIONS: MLL gene rearrangements were detected with a single probe and a single restriction-enzyme digest in all DNA samples from patients with the common 11q23 translocations as well as in 16 patients or cell lines with other 11q23 anomalies. The ability to detect an MLL gene rearrangement rapidly and reliably, especially in patients with limited material for cytogenetic analysis, should make it possible to identify patients who have a poor prognosis and therefore require aggressive chemotherapy or marrow transplantation.","['Thirman, M J', 'Gill, H J', 'Burnett, R C', 'Mbangkollo, D', 'McCabe, N R', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Ziemin-van der Poel, S', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Morgan, R', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Thirman MJ', 'Gill HJ', 'Burnett RC', 'Mbangkollo D', 'McCabe NR', 'Kobayashi H', 'Ziemin-van der Poel S', 'Kaneko Y', 'Morgan R', 'Sandberg AA', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/23 00:00,1993/09/23 00:01,['1993/09/23 00:00'],"['1993/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199309233291302 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Sep 23;329(13):909-14. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199309233291302.,"['CA38725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['N Engl J Med. 1993 Sep 23;329(13):958-9.

Since nearly all newborns in the United States receive this drug, the public health implications of this association, if confirmed, would be substantial. METHODS: We examined the relation between vitamin K and cancer in a nested case-control study that used data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project, a multi-center, prospective study of pregnancy, delivery, and childhood. Among 54,795 children born from 1959 through 1966, 48 cases of cancer were diagnosed after the first day of life and before the eighth birthday. Each case child was matched with five randomly selected controls whose last study visit occurred at or after the age when the case child's cancer was diagnosed. Exposure to vitamin K was determined from study forms and medical records. RESULTS: Vitamin K had been administered to 68 percent of the 44 case children and 71 percent of the 226 controls for whom data were available (matched odds ratio, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 1.71). The odds ratio was 0.47 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.14 to 1.55) for leukemia and 1.08 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 2.61) for other cancers. Sequential adjustment for potential confounding factors did not change the results substantially. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between exposure to vitamin K and an increased risk of any childhood cancer or of all childhood cancers combined, although a slightly increased risk could not be ruled out. The benefits of neonatal vitamin K prophylaxis against hemorrhagic disease have been well described. Unless other evidence supporting an association between vitamin K and cancer appears, there is no reason to abandon the routine administration of vitamin K to newborns.","['Klebanoff, M A', 'Read, J S', 'Mills, J L', 'Shiono, P H']","['Klebanoff MA', 'Read JS', 'Mills JL', 'Shiono PH']","['Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention Research, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Confounding Factors, Epidemiologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Vitamin K/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Vitamin K Deficiency Bleeding/prevention & control']",1993/09/23 00:00,1993/09/23 00:01,['1993/09/23 00:00'],"['1993/09/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/23 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/23 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199309233291301 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1993 Sep 23;329(13):905-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199309233291301.,,['N Engl J Med. 1993 Sep 23;329(13):957-8.

However, these lymphocytes mediated cytotoxicity only against tumor cell lines, and not against AML blasts. Additional in vitro activation with higher dose of IL-2 was necessary for induction of AML blast oncolysis. This indicates that the concomitant treatment with continuous and periodic bolus IL-2 infusion may be necessary, to achieve higher levels of IL-2 and subsequently, more potent lymphocyte activation. Alternatively, it may not be possible to induce optimal antileukemia response in vivo with tolerable doses of IL-2, and the adoptive therapy with in vitro supremely activated lymphocytes may represent an option. In this article, we discuss several approaches to the supreme activation of cytotoxic lymphocytes against highly resistant AML blasts and their possibilities in leukemia therapy.","['Lotzova, E']",['Lotzova E'],"['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S69-74.,['CA 55597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The activity of this enhancer has been shown to be inducible with phorbol esters. Within the enhancer the beta E2 element is responsible for the major part of the inducibility, multimerised beta E2 alone is also highly phorbol ester inducible. The beta E2 element contains a consensus ets-binding site as well as a core motif, and we have shown that the beta E2 ets site binds both Ets-1 and Ets-2 in vitro and that purified core binding factor (CBF) can bind the core site present in beta E2. Mutations which specifically disrupt Ets-1 and Ets-2 binding abolish inducibility as well as reducing activity, whereas mutants which cannot bind CBF have only reduced basal activity. In Jurkat, which has a high level of endogenous Ets-1, multimerized beta E2 was inactive unless treated with PMA. However when transfected into cells with no detectable Ets-1 the beta E2 multimer was highly active in the absence of PMA. Co-transfection of an Ets-1 expression construct with the full enhancer into Jurkat cells led to a repression of enhancer activity, suggesting a repressive role for Ets-1. Co-transfection of Ets-1 was also able to repress strongly the activity of the beta E2 multimer. Repression of activity from both the full enhancer construct and the beta E2 multimer was most dramatic in the presence of PMA, suggesting that Ets-1 could block TcR beta activation. The Ets-1 expression construct used transactivated the HTLV-1 LTR which has also been shown to bind Ets-1. The repression of beta E2 activity by Ets-1 appears therefore to be specific. In conclusion, the combination of ets and core sites in beta E2 constitutes a novel inducible element, which is specifically transrepressed by Ets-1.","['Wotton, D', 'Prosser, H M', 'Owen, M J']","['Wotton D', 'Prosser HM', 'Owen MJ']","['Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/chemistry/*genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S55-60.,,,"['Ets-1', 'Ets-2']",,,,,,,

In the present study we have addressed the role of c-jun for the mitogenic response of primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts to TNF-alpha. Our data indicate that TNF-alpha treatment of these cells is associated with transcriptional activation of c-jun and accumulation of c-jun mRNA. In order to elucidate the role of c-jun for TNF-mediated growth stimulation, an antisense (AS) oligomer directed towards the translation initiation site of c-jun was instrumental. Uptake studies of oligonucleotides showed that incorporation of oligomers was maximal at 4 hours. Oligodeoxynucleotides remained stable in these cells for up to 24 hours. Treatment of AML blasts with the AS oligonucleotide resulted in intracellular duplex formation followed by efficient translation blockade of c-jun/AP-1. In contrast, sense (S) and none-sense (NS) oligodeoxynucleotides failed to form intracellular duplexes and also did not interfere with translation of c-jun/AP-1, suggesting specific elimination of c-jun/AP-1 by the AS oligomer. AML blasts cultured in the presence of AS to c-jun, but not of S or NS, failed to proliferatively respond to TNF-alpha stimulation.

Expression of p53 after transfection with a constitutive promotor, blocks cellular proliferation and leads to an apoptotic cell death. In normal cells, p53 expression is induced by irradiation; this has led to the hypothesis that p53 acts to inhibit replication during genetic repair. Cells which lack p53 are more prone to develop amplification.

The simultaneous musical transformation of both strands of mouse H1 histone variety-1 DNA enable us to appreciate the symmetrical beauty of successive palindromes appearing in both H1 histone and its complementary protein.","['Ohno, S']",['Ohno S'],"['Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010-0269.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Histones)']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Codon/chemistry', 'Histones/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Music', 'Open Reading Frames']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S157-9.,,,,,,,,,,

Using unmodified anti-Tac monoclonal antibody, one-third of the patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) treated have undergone a remission, in two cases complete. There was little toxicity observed; however, unmodified monoclonal antibodies are limited by their immunogenicity and their poor effector functions. To address these issues, ""humanized"" anti-Tac was produced that contains the complementarity-determining regions from the mouse with the remainder of the molecule derived from human IgG1 kappa. This antibody is dramatically less immunogenic than the murine version, has improved pharmacokinetics, and, in contrast to the parent antibody, manifests antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). To enhance its effector function, anti-Tac was armed with toxins and alpha- and beta-emitting radionuclides. In a clinical trial of 90Y-anti-Tac in ATL patients, at the doses used (5, 10, and 15 mCi 90Y-anti-Tac per patient), 10 of the 15 patients with ATL treated to date underwent sustained partial or complete remission.

Three consecutive multicenter studies in children with unprevious treated ALL have been completed including 994 patients. The first GBTLI-80 accrued 203 children from 1980 to 1982. It was delineated with the standard three drugs induction therapy, CNS protection for all pts comprised cranial irradiation and intrathecal Methotrexate. For low risk pts cranial irradiation with 18Gy was compared in a randomized trial with 24Gy. Maintenance therapy continued for 120 weeks. The 12 years of the event free survival rates for all risk groups is 50% (SD 5%). Regarding CNS relapses there was no significant statistical difference between pts that received 18 or 24Gy. The treatment strategy of GBTLI-82 (n = 360) from 1982 to 1985, consisted of the same previous induction, consolidation, CNS therapy with cranial irradiation 18 Gy (low risk) or 24Gy (high risk), followed by continuous maintenance for 2 years. The main question in this study was the comparison between sequential rotation or pulses of 3 pairs of drugs during maintenance. At a median follow-up of 10 years, the overall event free survival rates for all children is 58% (SD 4%). There was no significant difference between the two maintenance regimens. The successor GBTLI-85 ran from 1985 to 1988 and registered 431 pts. For the first time no cranial radiation was given to children with very good prognosis. For them, CNS protection was done with triple intrathecal therapy during all treatment. A consolidation therapy with high dose ARA-C was introduced for high risk pts and infants The 6.5 years event free survival for all children is 70% (SD 4%). Significant better results were achieved for high risk and infants pts (EFS 50%).

Such long-term cultures (LTC) have been used to develop quantitative assays for the most primitive populations of hematopoietic cells currently detectable in adult marrow. In addition they provide a unique model for analysis of the complex molecular mechanisms that may regulate primitive hematopoietic cell population dynamics in vivo. Similar studies with LTC of cells from patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) have made it possible to detect and characterize very primitive neoplastic cell populations in this disease. These latter studies have revealed differences in the properties of primitive CML cells that both reflect and explain their increased turnover and are thus presumably part of the mechanism that enables the neoplastic clone to expand in vivo. In addition, the most primitive neoplastic cells in CML patients are abnormally distributed between the marrow and blood and their ability to maintain their numbers in LTC has also been found to be defective. Assessment of the number and behaviour of primitive cells in LTC of CML marrow has been used to identify those patients most likely to benefit from intensive therapy supported by transplantation of cultured autologous marrow. Twenty-two such CML patients have now been treated with this experimental protocol.

Procedures developed to isolate these so-called long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) in highly purified form allow their separation from most other hematopoietic cells as well as from stromal cells and their precursors also present in the marrow. We have used such procedures in conjunction with the LTC system to identify specific growth factors that support human LTC-IC maintenance and differentiation and to make comparisons with effects on later events in hematopoiesis. In some studies, soluble growth factors were added exogenously to the study cultures. In others, marrow-derived fibroblasts were genetically engineered to allow increased levels of specific human growth factors to be endogenously produced. In both of these ways, the influence of granulocyte--macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, Interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, and Steel factor were investigated. Increased provision of GM-CSF alone (or in combination with other factors) enhanced terminal cell differentiation (production of granulocytes and macrophages), although the same conditions had no influence on LTC-IC differentiation (production of clonogenic cells) or on LTC-IC maintenance. In contrast, G-CSF, IL-3 and IL-6 alone (and more so when combined) in the presence of feeders effectively enhanced LTC-IC differentiation and was less active on later stages of granulopoiesis. Provision of additional exogenous Steel factor also enhanced LTC-IC differentiation, although Steel factor alone, without feeders or other growth factors, did not support either the initial differentiation of LTC-IC into clonogenic cells or their subsequent differentiation into mature granulocytes and macrophages. No combination of exogenously added growth factors was found that enhanced LTC-IC maintenance over that achieved with primary marrow feeders. However, some murine fibroblasts (including those of SI/SI origin), as well as certain exogenous growth factors (including Steel factor), were able to substitute for feeders in this regard. These observations highlight the likelihood of redundancy in factors that can elicit similar biological responses at the earliest as well as later stages of hematopoietic cell development. Nevertheless, it appears that the responses of hematopoietic cells at different stages of differentiation to any particular factor may differ markedly and that the nature of any particular response is not yet predictable from a knowledge of effects on earlier or later cell types.","['Sutherland, H J', 'Hogge, D E', 'Eaves, C J']","['Sutherland HJ', 'Hogge DE', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/metabolism']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S122-5.,,,,,,,,,,

These observations confirm that CSF-1 is a genuine regulator of macrophage and osteoclast formation in vivo.

The op/op mice have increased levels of both endogenous GM-CSF and IL-3, which apparently are not fully able to compensate for the absence of CSF-1.

In the present study, we further characterized signal transduction by the reconstituted hGM-CSFR both in NIH3T3 cells and BA/F3 cells. We found that the reconstituted hGM-CSFR transduces signals in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and BA/F3 cells in response to human GM-CSF to activate transcription of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc protooncogenes. hGM-CSF also induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation and DNA synthesis in both cell types. The ability of hGM-CSFR to transduce signals was affected by inhibitors of tyrosine kinase.

An IL-1 inhibitor has been recently purified and cloned. This molecule binds to the IL-1 receptors but has no IL-1 like activity fulfilling the characteristics of a pure Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). We studied the in vitro effect of human recombinant IL-1ra on proliferation of AML blasts. Spontaneous as well as IL-1 stimulated AML proliferation was significantly inhibited by the addition of 50 ng/ml of recombinant IL-1ra in a dose dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of IL-1ra was measurable after 12 hours of culture and reached a plateau at 60 hrs. We found that IL-1ra could compete with IL-1 in binding to specific IL-1 receptors on AML cells. As expected, culture supernatants of unstimulated leukemic samples contained IL-1 beta and GM-CSF activity. The incubation of the same leukemic blasts with IL-1 ra was followed by reduction or disappearance of GM-CSF in culture supernatants whereas the IL-1 beta production was only partially modulated. By Northern blot experiments performed on freshly isolated, uncultured leukemic blasts, we found a constitutive expression of the IL-1 beta gene in 19 of 23 AML cases analyzed. On the contrary, only three of these patients express the IL-1 RA mRNA. All together these results suggest that imbalanced secretion of IL-1 and its natural receptor antagonist could contribute to the unrestricted growth of AML cells.","['Rambaldi, A', 'Torcia, M', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Barbui, T', 'Cozzolino, F']","['Rambaldi A', 'Torcia M', 'Dinarello CA', 'Barbui T', 'Cozzolino F']","['Division of Hematology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (IL1RN protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin 1 Receptor Antagonist Protein', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Sialoglycoproteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7 Suppl 2:S10-2.,,,,,,,,,,

Previously reported methods have employed partial hepatectomy followed 24 hr later by asanguineous perfusion of the regenerating liver with retrovirus. We have developed a simpler method of in vivo transduction in which we deliver an intraportal bolus of retrovirus to the regenerating rodent liver during a brief period of hepatic in-flow occlusion. On Day 0, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 19) underwent 70% hepatectomy to induce hepatocyte replication. On Day 1, retroviral supernatant was harvested from an amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line that packaged an LNL6-derived vector containing the cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression of the Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase (beta gal) gene. Twenty-four hours after partial hepatectomy, experimental rats (N = 17) received 6 x 10(5) colony-forming units of retrovirus by intraportal injection during a 3-min occlusion of the hepatic artery and portal vein. Control rats (N = 2) received intraportal medium (without retrovirus), also during in-flow occlusion. The procedure required 20-25 min, and the survival rate was 84%. Cryostat sections were prepared from liver biopsies obtained on Post-transduction Days 8 and 15 and stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl- beta-D-galactopyranoside to detect beta gal expression. Light microscopic examination of Day 8 sections from surviving experimental rats (N = 14) revealed 0.10-1.00% blue (i.e., transduced) hepatocytes per low power field, while sections from control rats (N = 2) exhibited no blue cells.

D, Y, DD, DY/X and high molecular weight fragments were observed in sera of all the patients obtained at the onset of APL. These results showed that various degrees of fibrinogenolysis, concomitant with fibrinolysis, was occurring in APL patients presenting DIC. However, changes in the patterns of the FDP fragments during anticoagulation therapy were apparently different among three patients. Namely, fibrinogenolysis was dominant in case 1, while fibrinolysis was dominant in case 2. Interestingly, fibrinogenolysis and fibrinolysis were almost equivalent from the onset to the end of DIC in case 3. In case 3, FDP and FDP-D dimer were remarkably elevated about two months before the onset of APL, although their elevation was not complicated with DIC but with bone marrow necrosis. At that time, serum LDH levels and plasma polymorphonuclear elastase (PMN-Ela) were increased presumably due to the release of these enzymes from necrotic bone marrow, and the levels of CRP and plasma fibrinogen were increased probably due to an infectious complication. In non-DIC period of case 3, FDP and FDP-D dimer were spontaneously decreased without reduction of PMN-Ela levels, after three weeks of chemotherapy for microbial agents. Taken together, characteristics of FDP fragments were unique to each case of APL-DIC, probably because many factors differently affected the degradation of fibrin and/or fibrinogen.","['Okumura, N', 'Furuwatari, C', 'Ishikawa, S', 'Furihata, K', 'Katsuyama, T', 'Kanai, M', 'Nakahata, T', 'Saitoh, H']","['Okumura N', 'Furuwatari C', 'Ishikawa S', 'Furihata K', 'Katsuyama T', 'Kanai M', 'Nakahata T', 'Saitoh H']","['Central Clinical Laboratories, Shinshu University Hospital, Matsumoto.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

Mya arenaria, the soft-shell clam, is particularly interesting because it develops a leukemia detected first in the hemolymph and, as the disease progresses, in solid tissue. We have previously described a leukemia-specific protein (Miosky et al., 1989) identified by murine monoclonal antibodies generated to pure populations of leukemia cells. In the following work, a monoclonal antibody was generated to normal hemocytes of Mya. The antibody, designated 2A4, was evaluated by ELISA, immunocytochemistry, Western blotting, and flow cytometry. The 2A4 antigen was detected on 87% normal adherent cells. However, 2A4 was lost as leukemia cells proliferated. The mature leukemia cell, which is nonadherent, neither expresses 2A4 nor can 2A4 be detected in the leukemia cell lystate. Western blot analyses reveal that 2A4 reacts with a 130-kDa protein.

A colony that permanently expresses the enzyme activity was isolated, and designated K562/Zneo. Incubation of K562/Zneo cells (1 x 10(4)) with nonadherent human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) resulted in the release of beta-gal activity depending on the incubation time and the number of effector cells. Released beta-gal activity was assayed sensitively by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-galactoside, a fluorescent substrate. The cytolytic activity of PBL was augmented significantly when the cells were preincubated with interleukin-2 for 20 h. This enzyme release assay showed a comparable sensitivity to that of 51Cr release assay. Thus, K562/Zneo cell line is thought to be useful for the nonradioactive assay of human NK and lymphokine-activated killer activities.","['Ohmori, H', 'Ikeda, H', 'Tanigawa, T', 'Takai, T', 'Hikida, M']","['Ohmori H', 'Ikeda H', 'Tanigawa T', 'Takai T', 'Hikida M']","['Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Okayama University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,['EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)'],IM,"['*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/*genetics']",1993/08/26 00:00,1993/08/26 00:01,['1993/08/26 00:00'],"['1993/08/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/26 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(93)90283-D [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(93)90283-d [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1993 Aug 26;164(1):131-5. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(93)90283-d.,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to examine the underlying mechanism(s) by which CKS-17 down-regulates the TNF-alpha mRNA expression using a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 stimulated with the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin E. A cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin does not reverse the inhibition of TNF-alpha mRNA expression by CKS-17, suggesting that prostaglandins are not responsible for the suppressive action of CKS-17. The inhibitory effect of CKS-17 is, however, significantly blocked by a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, indicating that CKS-17 requires de novo protein synthesis to induce the suppressive activity. The mRNA stability assays using actinomycin D show that CKS-17 does not decrease the TNF-alpha mRNA stability. Nuclear run-on transcription assays further reveal that CKS-17 suppresses the TNF-alpha mRNA transcription rate. Taken together, these results suggest that the synthetic retroviral peptide CKS-17 down-regulates TNF-alpha mRNA expression through inhibition of transcriptional activation of the TNF-alpha gene, which requires de novo synthesis of a transcriptional repressor protein(s).","['Haraguchi, S', 'Good, R A', 'Cianciolo, G J', 'James-Yarish, M', 'Day, N K']","['Haraguchi S', 'Good RA', 'Cianciolo GJ', 'James-Yarish M', 'Day NK']","[""Department of Pediatrics, All Children's Hospital, University of South Florida, St. Petersburg 33701.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Enterotoxins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (enterotoxin E, Staphylococcal)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', '99273-04-8 (CKS 17)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enterotoxins/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*pharmacology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Sep 1;151(5):2733-41.,['CA40931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the T18d promoter region and responses to IFN-gamma.,2646-57,"Type I (alpha/beta) and type II (gamma) IFN enhance MHC class I gene expression through an IFN-responsive element (IRE) present in the 5' flanking region of the class I-a genes. Comparison of the 5' sequences between classical class I-a genes and T region class I-b genes reveals little homology except for presence of a potential IRE. We have found that cell surface expression of thymus leukemia Ag (TL) was up-regulated by IFN-gamma to a greater extent than H-2K,D in all TL+ T cell lines tested. In contrast, IFN-alpha/beta, which significantly increased H-2K and H-2D Ag expression, had only minor effects on TL expression. Resting peripheral T cells, which were considered to be TL- from previous studies, were found to express TL at a low level as determined by flow cytometry, immunoprecipitation, as well as polymerase chain reaction; the level of expression also could be elevated by IFN-gamma. To examine the control of TL gene transcription and its regulation by IFN-gamma, varying lengths of the T18d 5' flanking region were analyzed in chloramphenicol acetyl transferase assays. By deletion analysis, promoter activity and IFN-gamma responsiveness were localized to an 86-bp fragment that contains the IRE. Both responses were localized further to a 32-bp fragment that contained the IRE at its 3' end. RNase protection assays revealed two major transcription initiation sites, one immediately 5' of the IRE and another approximately 60 bp downstream. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from resting T cells, thymocytes, and T cell tumor lines confirmed the RNase protection data. Thus, transcription of T18d initiates much further upstream than the classical class I genes, can utilize an unusual promoter element, and can be elevated by IFN-gamma.","['Wang, I M', 'Mehta, V', 'Cook, R G']","['Wang IM', 'Mehta V', 'Cook RG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1993 Sep 1;151(5):2646-57.,['AI17897/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,['T18<up>d</up>'],,,,,,,

Relatively little is known about which molecules regulate differentiation-induced growth arrest. In the present report, we sought to determine whether the mammalian low molecular weight heat shock protein (hsp28) was a candidate growth-regulatory molecule during human hematopoiesis. To this end, hsp28 protein expression was examined during phorbol ester (PMA)-induced macrophage differentiation of the human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemic cell line. Whereas hsp28 was constitutively expressed at relatively low levels in an unphosphorylated state, hsp28 was rapidly phosphorylated within 4 hr following PMA-induced differentiation, preceding increased hsp28 protein levels at 24-48 h. In contrast to other differentiative agents, hsp28 steady state mRNA and protein were regulated concordantly in response to macrophage differentiation. More importantly, these changes were transient, and occurred concomitant with the down-regulation of cellular proliferation and the onset of G1 phase cell cycle arrest.

We have used DNase I footprinting with K562 erythroleukemia cell extracts to identify protein components of the minimal LCR element, hypersensitive site 2. Six major regions of protection were observed, and the occupation of two regions (sites II and V) was strongly temperature-dependent. Fractionation of K562 nuclear proteins revealed a single major protein that bound tightly to site II. An E-box was necessary for high affinity binding to DNA. We used antibodies and recombinant USF protein to prove that the helix-loop-helix transcription factor USF is the only detectable component in K562 cells that binds to this site. Despite significant differences between site II and a canonical USF-binding site, the USF binding affinity was comparable for the two sites. In both cases the interaction with the E-box of either wild-type USF or a approximately 15-kDa minimal USF DNA binding polypeptide displays an unusual positive temperature dependence, consistent with the observed footprinting behavior. The results show that a relatively ubiquitous factor, not confined to erythroid cells, is an important part of the complex of proteins bound at hypersensitive site 2 of the LCR in K562 cells.","['Bresnick, E H', 'Felsenfeld, G']","['Bresnick EH', 'Felsenfeld G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (USF1 protein, human)', '0 (Upstream Stimulatory Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'DNA/chemistry/*metabolism', 'DNA Probes', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Upstream Stimulatory Factors']",1993/09/05 00:00,1993/09/05 00:01,['1993/09/05 00:00'],"['1993/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46702-0 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 5;268(25):18824-34.,,,,,,,,,,

We examined whether phosphorylation correlates with the induction of high affinity binding of laminin by the alpha 6A beta 1 receptor. Two potential phosphorylation sites for protein kinase C, serine 1041 and serine 1048, are present in the cytoplasmic domain of the alpha 6A subunit. We introduced point mutations into the alpha 6A cDNA, replacing either one or both of the serine residues with alanine. Wild-type and mutant alpha 6A cDNAs were transfected into K562 cells. All alpha 6A subunit mutants were expressed at levels similar to those of wild-type alpha 6A and formed heterodimers with endogenous beta 1. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of wild-type and mutant alpha 6A subunits in resting K562 cells and after treatment with PMA showed that serine 1041, but not serine 1048, is the target residue of PMA-induced phosphorylation. Cells expressing alpha 6A mutant subunits or wild-type alpha 6A transfectants all bound laminin in the presence, but not in the absence of PMA; however, the extent of binding differed. Cells transfected with alpha 6A containing the serine to alanine mutation showed a 2-3-fold higher binding to laminin than cells transfected with alpha 6A containing serine 1041. The results indicate that phosphorylation of the alpha 6A cytoplasmic domain is not required for the induction of high affinity of the alpha 6A beta 1 receptor by PMA, and suggest that, in contrast, it may reduce the affinity of this integrin for ligand.","['Hogervorst, F', 'Kuikman, I', 'Noteboom, E', 'Sonnenberg, A']","['Hogervorst F', 'Kuikman I', 'Noteboom E', 'Sonnenberg A']","['The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Division of Cell Biology, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', 'Humans', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/05 00:00,1993/09/05 00:01,['1993/09/05 00:00'],"['1993/09/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/05 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46641-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Sep 5;268(25):18427-30.,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphokine therapy may exert an antitumor effect through a variety of mechanisms, including the induction of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity. We tested the ability of interleukin-7 (IL-7) to induce LAK cytotoxicity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy subjects and from patients early after ABMT. LAK activity was defined as lysis of Daudi by PBMC after incubation with IL-7 at 10 to 100 ng/mL or IL-2 at 1000 U/mL. PBMC from four healthy subjects were cultured with either IL-7 or IL-2. IL-7 induced LAK activity in two of the four, whereas IL-2 induced LAK activity in all four. The median percent lysis (effector-to-target ratio [E:T] 40:1) with IL-7 (23%) was lower than with IL-2 (67%). PBMC were obtained from 15 patients 27 to 84 days after autologous (n = 13) or syngeneic (n = 2) bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and tested for IL-7-induced LAK activity. Eleven exhibited significant activity (10% to 77% lysis at E:T 40:1). In contrast to the results in PBMC from normal subjects, in PBMC from ABMT patients IL-7 induced LAK activity of a magnitude similar to that induced by IL-2. Studies were also performed on PBMC from eight patients who had received IL-2 after ABMT (3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d) for 4 days by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion. In seven of the eight patients, IL-7 induced significant LAK activity, which was higher than that seen in PBMC from ABMT patients who had not received IL-2. Thus, IL-7 reproducibly induced significant LAK activity in cells obtained early after autologous or syngeneic BMT. Indeed, such LAK activity was comparable quantitatively to that induced by IL-2. Finally, IL-7 induced an even greater LAK activity in vitro in PBMC obtained after ABMT and preactivated in vivo by IL-2 therapy. The results suggest that IL-7 may have a potential immunotherapeutic role, alone or with IL-2, after ABMT.","['Pavletic, Z', 'Benyunes, M C', 'Thompson, J A', 'Lindgren, C G', 'Massumoto, C', 'Alderson, M R', 'Buckner, C D', 'Fefer, A']","['Pavletic Z', 'Benyunes MC', 'Thompson JA', 'Lindgren CG', 'Massumoto C', 'Alderson MR', 'Buckner CD', 'Fefer A']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Clinical Research Division, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroblastoma/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1993 Sep;21(10):1371-8.,"['CA-15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

A tumor promoter, TPA, induced a megakaryocyte marker, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GP IIb/IIIa) or IIIa (GP IIIa), but suppressed erythroid differentiation. On the other hand, aphidicolin, which is a potent inhibitor of DNA replication, inhibited GP IIb/IIIa or IIIa expression, but induced the expression of erythroid phenotypes. These phenomena were observed in all erythroleukemia cell lines tested. The bromodeoxyuridine labeling experiments indicated that de novo DNA synthesis was completely suppressed by aphidicolin treatment but was well preserved in TPA-treated cells. Among these three cell lines, erythropoietin (EPO) treatment induced erythroid differentiation of TF1 cells, which was dependent on GM-CSF or IL-3. In this case, EPO functioned as the survival factor and mild stimulator for cell proliferation as well as the inducer of erythroid differentiation. However, when either GM-CSF or IL-3 was depleted from the culture medium, TF1 ceased cell growth; concomitantly, hemoglobin-positive cells appeared, which is consistent with the results obtained with aphidicolin. The incubation of K562 cells for 48 h with either TPA or aphidicolin induced the irreversible commitment of cells to megakaryocytic and erythroid lineages, respectively. Our results using three different erythroleukemia cell lines suggest that a possible linkage between the DNA replication system and the selection of a differentiation lineage is the common feature of human erythroleukemia cell lines, and that these culture systems provide a suitable model for the analysis of the signal transduction system for differentiation lineage selection.","['Murate, T', 'Saga, S', 'Hotta, T', 'Asano, H', 'Ito, T', 'Kato, K', 'Tsushita, K', 'Kinoshita, T', 'Ichikawa, A', 'Yoshida, S']","['Murate T', 'Saga S', 'Hotta T', 'Asano H', 'Ito T', 'Kato K', 'Tsushita K', 'Kinoshita T', 'Ichikawa A', 'Yoshida S', 'et al.']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)']",IM,"['Aphidicolin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S001448278371219X [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1993.1219 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1993 Sep;208(1):35-43. doi: 10.1006/excr.1993.1219.,,,,,,,,,,

Clones isolated from a complementary DNA library prepared from r- ICR27TK.3 cells, in which one glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene has been deleted, contained a single adenosine to thymidine transversion in the third position of codon 753, resulting in the substitution of phenylalanine for leucine. This mutant gene (GR753F) had only 13% of the trans-activating activity of the normal gene and produced a M(r) 92,000 receptor protein with the same r- phenotype seen in ICR27TK.3 cells. Analysis of complementary DNA clones isolated from a library prepared from parental glucocorticoid-sensitive 6TG1.1 cells showed that these cells express both a normal GR gene (GR+) and the GR753F gene. Thus, their genotype is GR+/GR753F. Analysis of clones isolated from a complementary DNA library prepared from glucocorticoid-resistant activation-labile 3R7. 6TG.4 cells revealed the presence of the GR753F gene and a second mutant gene (GR421Y) containing a guanosine to adenosine transition in the second position of codon 421, resulting in the replacement of the first cysteine of the proximal zinc finger of the DNA-binding domain by tyrosine. This mutant had no trans-activating activity but normal ligand-binding characteristics. Thus, the genotype of act1 3R7.6TG.4 cells is GR421Y/GR753F. Consequently, the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity of receptors in act1 cells is attributable to the GR753F gene, while the ligand-binding activity seen in intact cells is attributable to the GR421Y gene. These results provide a direct explanation for the r- and act1 phenotypes of glucocorticoid-resistant cells and demonstrate that glucocorticoid-sensitive cells derived from CEM-C7 cells contain a heterogeneous population of normal and mutant receptors.","['Powers, J H', 'Hillmann, A G', 'Tang, D C', 'Harmon, J M']","['Powers JH', 'Hillmann AG', 'Tang DC', 'Harmon JM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, Maryland 20814-4799.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'Codon/chemistry/genetics', 'Dexamethasone/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation/genetics', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 1;53(17):4059-65.,['CA32226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['GR', 'GR421Y', 'GR753F']",,,,,,,

In the present study, the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (pADPRp) during the course of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was examined. Treatment of HL-60 human leukemia cells with the topoisomerase II-directed anticancer agent etoposide resulted in morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis. Endonucleolytic degradation of DNA to generate nucleosomal fragments occurred simultaneously. Western blotting with epitope-specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies revealed that these characteristic apoptotic changes were accompanied by early, quantitative cleavage of the M(r) 116,000 pADPRp polypeptide to an M(r) approximately 25,000 fragment containing the amino-terminal DNA-binding domain of pADPRp and an M(r) approximately 85,000 fragment containing the automodification and catalytic domains. Activity blotting revealed that the M(r) approximately 85,000 fragment retained basal pADPRp activity but was not activated by exogenous nicked DNA. Similar cleavage of pADPRp was observed after exposure of HL-60 cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents including cis-diaminedichloroplatinum(II), colcemid, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine, and methotrexate; to gamma-irradiation; or to the protein synthesis inhibitors puromycin or cycloheximide. Similar changes were observed in MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells treated with trifluorothymidine or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine and in gamma-irradiated or glucocorticoid-treated rat thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. Treatment with several compounds (tosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, tosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetamide) prevented both the proteolytic cleavage of pADPRp and the internucleosomal fragmentation of DNA. The results suggest that proteolytic cleavage of pADPRp, in addition to being an early marker of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, might reflect more widespread proteolysis that is a critical biochemical event early during the process of physiological cell death.","['Kaufmann, S H', 'Desnoyers, S', 'Ottaviano, Y', 'Davidson, N E', 'Poirier, G G']","['Kaufmann SH', 'Desnoyers S', 'Ottaviano Y', 'Davidson NE', 'Poirier GG']","['Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21287.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/chemistry', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 1;53(17):3976-85.,"['CA50435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

To further investigate the safety and antitumor effect of this agent, we conducted a single arm, dose escalation study of a 90-min infusion of DAB486IL-2 daily for 5 days. Patients with cancers of a histology previously reported to express the p55 component of the IL-2 receptor and who could not receive potentially more effective therapy were eligible for enrollment. Fifteen men and 8 women with a median age of 49 years were given a total of 51 courses of DAB486IL-2. The maximum tolerated dose was 0.3 mg/kg/day defined by renal insufficiency associated with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia. The clearance of DAB486IL-2 from serum fit a one-compartment model with a half-life of 11.5 +/- 4.3 (SD) min at the 0.2-mg/kg dose. Two patients sustained a partial response and 4 patients had tumor reduction not qualifying for an objective response. No tumors that were negative for expression of the p55 subunit of the receptor responded to DAB486IL-2 treatment. Reduction in size occurred in 2 tumors in which p55 expression was unknown and 4 patients with tumors that were known to be p55 positive. Dosing determined by specific activity rather than mass also appeared to be an important determinant of response. This study suggests that the presence of p55 expression on tumor cells is necessary, but alone may not be sufficient to achieve a tumor response. The correlation of additional variables such as specific activity of DAB486IL-2 and tumor expression of the p75 subunit of the IL-2 receptor and receptor function will also require further study.","['LeMaistre, C F', 'Craig, F E', 'Meneghetti, C', 'McMullin, B', 'Parker, K', 'Reuben, J', 'Boldt, D H', 'Rosenblum, M', 'Woodworth, T']","['LeMaistre CF', 'Craig FE', 'Meneghetti C', 'McMullin B', 'Parker K', 'Reuben J', 'Boldt DH', 'Rosenblum M', 'Woodworth T']","['University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio 78284-7880.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (DAB(486)-interleukin 2)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*administration & dosage/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage/immunology/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*therapy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1993 Sep 1;53(17):3930-4.,,,,,,,,,,

When the cells were cultured with 100 microM Pb2+ for 48 h, the rate of cellular iron uptake from transferrin decreased to 46% of that in untreated cells. Scatchard analysis of the binding data revealed that this reduction was the result of a decrease in the number of transferrin receptors rather than an alteration in ligand-receptor affinity. The results of immunoprecipitation of transferrin receptors on the cell surface also confirmed the decreased expression of transferrin receptors by lead-treated cells. The down-regulation of transferrin receptors by treatment with lead did not result from a decrease in the total amount of the receptor, as determined by immunoblotting. Moreover, the biosynthesis of the receptor was unaffected by lead treatment. Thus, the down-regulation of surface transferrin receptors in lead-treated cells might be due to a redistribution of receptors rather than an actual loss of receptors from the cell. Using kinetic analysis, it was shown that redistribution of the receptor did not result from the alteration in the rates of transferrin receptor recycling. A comparison of the amounts of transferrin receptor on the cell surface and in the cycling pool revealed that the sequestration of the receptor from normal flow through the cycle might cause down-regulation of the surface receptor.","['Kohno, H', 'Taketani, S', 'Tokunaga, R']","['Kohno H', 'Taketani S', 'Tokunaga R']","['Department of Hygiene, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biometals,"Biometals : an international journal on the role of metal ions in biology, biochemistry, and medicine",9208478,"['0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '2P299V784P (Lead)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lead/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00140107 [doi]'],ppublish,Biometals. 1993 Summer;6(2):77-83. doi: 10.1007/BF00140107.,,,,,,,,,,

A new mechanism of invasion of malignant cells has been described, according to which neoplastic cells behave and function as parasites using host-cells to divide, survive and eventually produce nuclear vlimata (bullets). Nuclear vlimata are the end cell products of incomplete, unequal, assymetrical division of neoplastic cells. The nuclear vlima exhibits similar morphology to spermatozoa and virus (head with, or without, tail) and invades the cytoplasm and/or nucleus of surrounding host-cells by a similar mechanism to sperm-oocyte interaction (fertilization) or viral cell infection, in the events of nuclear vlima-->tumor-->nuclear vlima-->tumor. The nuclear vlima head contains and transfers DNA, and when incorporated into the host-nucleus is indistinguishable from nucleoli and when in the cytoplasm is similar to sperm pronucleus, observed after sperm penetration of the oocyte. Function of nuclear vlimata is directly dependent on the specific extracellular matrix produced by malignant cells, consisting of glycosaminoglycans-protease-membranes.

However, the mechanisms behind the described effects on myeloid progenitor cell growth are presently unknown. It is conceivable that both leukotrienes and lipoxins may act through modulation of endogenous cytokine production. However, it should be noted, that these lipoxygenase products totally failed to induce colony growth in the absence of GM-CSF. Moreover, the role of lipoxins in the bone marrow needs to be further clarified, since LXA4 induced both synergistic (with GM-CSF) and antagonistic (with LTC4) effects on progenitor cell growth. A possible pathophysiological role for leukotrienes and lipoxins may be suggested in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Thus, the capacity of hematological cells from CML patients to synthesize LTC4 was significantly increased. In addition, we have recently reported that CML platelets possessed a markedly decreased ability to participate in transcellular synthesis of the potential inhibitors of myelopoiesis, LXA4 and 5(S),12(S)-diHETE (Stenke et al., 1991b). Moreover, the production of these compounds was totally abolished in platelets obtained from CML patients in blastic crisis.

A new interpretation.,281-4,"About forty years ago, Henry Kaplan and collaborators reported that four weekly X-ray doses of 160 rads each were highly leukemogenic in C57BL mice. A single dose of 350 Rads had a week leukemogenic effect. These authors also demonstrated that lead shielding of the thigh during irradiation prevented the development of leukemia. They reported that intravenous injection of syngeneic bone marrow cells into irradiated mice facilitated the regeneration of the thymus and prevented the development of X-ray-induced tumors. We characterized the thymic Ia+ dendritic cells (DC) with the aid of a fluorescence-activated cell-sorter (FACS). It was found that exposure of mice to a leukemogenic regimen of fractionated X-irradiation treatment led to a gradual decrease in the number of thymic DC. The disappearance of thymic DC and the development of leukemia were prevented by intravenous injection of syngeneic bone marrow or by lead shielding of the femur during irradiation. These results indicated that the fractionated irradiation caused a decline in the number of DC and, as a result, diminution of the natural defense against the developing tumor. Homing of the injected bone marrow DC into the thymus can be connected to the prevention of tumor development. Since leukemogenic T cells produce interleukin-4(IL-4), we tested the effect of the conditioned medium in which YAB-3 cells (tumorigenic Th cells: CD4+, CD8-, Thy-1+) were cultivated. Following injection of the conditioned medium into the mouse footpads, the number of skin Langerhans cells (LC) decreased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Becker, Y', 'Sprecher, E', 'Bentov, I', 'Berkowitz, C']","['Becker Y', 'Sprecher E', 'Bentov I', 'Berkowitz C']","['Department of Molecular Virology, Faculty of Medicine, Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*immunology']",1993/05/01 00:00,1993/05/01 00:01,['1993/05/01 00:00'],"['1993/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 1993 May-Jun;7(3):281-4.,,,,,,16,,,,

Our data indicate that HTLV-I has a broad host range in vivo and that monocytes or cells of monocyte lineage such as tissue macrophages might comprise a virus reservoir in vivo.","['Koyanagi, Y', 'Itoyama, Y', 'Nakamura, N', 'Takamatsu, K', 'Kira, J', 'Iwamasa, T', 'Goto, I', 'Yamamoto, N']","['Koyanagi Y', 'Itoyama Y', 'Nakamura N', 'Takamatsu K', 'Kira J', 'Iwamasa T', 'Goto I', 'Yamamoto N']","['Department of Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*microbiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral', 'HTLV-I Antigens/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/microbiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology/*microbiology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/microbiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Virus Replication']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682283714510 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1993.1451 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 1993 Sep;196(1):25-33. doi: 10.1006/viro.1993.1451.,,,,,,,,,,

We have prepared a recombinant VV expressing the cDNA of the human cytokine HILDA/LIF (human interleukin for DA cells/leukaemia inhibitory factor), and used this virus to immunize mice against this protein, which is very homologous to its murine counterpart (approximately 80% homology). We also constructed and expressed by the same system a chimeric gene encoding the HILDA/LIF protein fused to the 37 COOH-terminal amino-acids of the human decay accelerating factor (DAF). This sequence proved to be sufficient for the targeting of the fusion protein to the cell membrane, where it is linked to the phosphatidylinositols. Both recombinant VVs induced cytokine-specific antibodies in mice as analysed with an ELISA where the recombinant HILDA/LIF was plastic-coated and a cytofluorometric assay where the LIF-DAF molecule was present at the cell surface of stably transfected P815. In the latter case HILDA/LIF remained biologically active suggesting that it was expressed in its native form. The LIF-DAF fusion protein was found to exhibit a better capacity to elicit an antibody response against the native form of the cytokine as detected in cytofluorometric assays. Whatever the recombinant virus used to immunize the mice, the MoAbs obtained were positive either in the ELISA or in the cytofluorometric assays but one, which suggested that the plastic coating induced a conformational change of HILDA/LIF.","['Taupin, J L', 'Acres, B', 'Dott, K', 'Schmitt, D', 'Kieny, M P', 'Gualde, N', 'Moreau, J F']","['Taupin JL', 'Acres B', 'Dott K', 'Schmitt D', 'Kieny MP', 'Gualde N', 'Moreau JF']","['CNRS URA 1456, Universite de Bordeaux II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/*immunology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Vaccinia virus']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb01728.x [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1993 Sep;38(3):293-301. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1993.tb01728.x.,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, growth factor-induced differentiation of M1 cells was accompanied by a late and persistent decrease in levels of mRNA and protein for a helix-loop-helix transcription factor, the SCL gene product. To evaluate whether reduced SCL expression was instrumental in monocyte differentiation, an SCL cDNA expression vector was introduced into M1 cells to obtain cell lines in which overexpression of SCL mRNA and protein was enforced. This resulted in a reduction in cells differentiating in response to LIF and OSM but not in response to IL-6. Scatchard analysis indicated that both parental and SCL-transfected cell lines exhibited similar receptor numbers and receptor affinities for LIF, OSM, and IL-6, suggesting that the differential responsiveness was not due to selective receptor down-modulation. Thus, these data implicate SCL in monocytic differentiation and provide evidence for differential receptor signaling pathways despite utilization of a common gp130 subunit by all three receptors.","['Tanigawa, T', 'Elwood, N', 'Metcalf, D', 'Cary, D', 'DeLuca, E', 'Nicola, N A', 'Begley, C G']","['Tanigawa T', 'Elwood N', 'Metcalf D', 'Cary D', 'DeLuca E', 'Nicola NA', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Lymphokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Retroviridae', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.16.7864 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Aug 15;90(16):7864-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.16.7864.,['CA22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['SCL'],,,,,,PMC47243,

Here we show that engagement of these receptors and of separate P2 purinergic receptors rapidly activates an outwardly rectifying K+ conductance [GK(OR)] in RBL cells. Activation of GK(OR) by the ligands 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA), ADP, and ATP was prevented by cytoplasmic guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate as well as by pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, implicating mediation by a G protein. Multiple cycles of induction and decay of GK(OR) were produced upon application and removal of ligand. Induction of GK(OR) by either ligand was much faster than the induction caused by guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (t1/2 < 10 sec vs. 210 sec.). In control cells the maximal whole-cell conductance elicited by ADP (2.25 +/- 0.30 nS) or ATP (2.50 +/- 0.33 nS) was about twice as large as that induced by NECA (1.03 +/- 0.11 nS), and similar to that previously reported for the guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate-elicited GK(OR) in RBL cells (2.58 +/- 1.59 nS). Treatment of RBL cells with dexamethasone upregulated Ca2+ responses to NECA, and it also nearly doubled the maximal conductance elicited by NECA without appreciable effect on responses to ADP or ATP. The failure of water-soluble second messengers to activate GK(OR) and the inability of 11 mM EGTA (< 10 nM Ca2+) to prevent activation by ADP suggest that the relevant pathway is membrane-delimited. Two ion-channel blockers inhibited antigen-stimulated secretion with IC50 values similar to those at which they blocked GK(OR), suggesting that activity of the outwardly rectifying K+ channel may be important for stimulus-response coupling in these cells. Potentiation of the secretory response by NECA may reflect, in part, the activation of GK(OR), which serves to repolarize the membrane more effectively than does the constitutive mechanism, thereby enhancing antigen-driven Ca2+ influx. This channel and its functionally associated receptors may allow neighboring cells of the host to modulate the response of mast cells to exogenous antigen.","['Qian, Y X', 'McCloskey, M A']","['Qian YX', 'McCloskey MA']","['Department of Zoology and Genetics, Iowa State University, Ames 50011-3223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Barium Compounds)', '0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '0VK51DA1T2 (barium chloride)', '24GP945V5T (Barium)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '7320-57-2 (APT)', '9B627AW319 (Nitrendipine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'ZZQ699148P (Dimaprit)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)"", 'Animals', 'Barium/pharmacology', '*Barium Compounds', 'Chlorides/pharmacology', 'Dimaprit/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Electrophysiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mast Cells/*physiology', 'Nitrendipine/pharmacology', 'Potassium Channels/drug effects/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.16.7844 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Aug 15;90(16):7844-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.16.7844.,,,,,,,,,PMC47239,

In previous in vitro studies in which uncommitted murine hematopoietic progenitors plated on a stromal cell layer differentiate into immature B cells, the inhibition of CD10/NEP increased early lymphoid colony numbers. To further characterize CD10/NEP function during lymphoid ontogeny in vivo, we utilized a Ly5 congenic mouse model in which the lymphoid differentiation of uncommitted hematopoietic progenitors from Ly5.1 donors was followed in sublethally irradiated Ly5.2 recipients treated with a specific long-acting CD10/NEP inhibitor (N-[L-(1-carboxy-2-phenyl)ethyl]-L-phenylalanyl-beta- alanine (SCH32615)). The expression of Ly5.1, B220, and surface IgM (sIgM) was utilized to characterize donor-derived hematopoietic cells (Ly5.1+), B lymphocytes (B220+), and mature B cells (B220+ sIgM+) from the lymphoid organs of recipient animals treated with SCH32615 or vehicle alone. SCH32615-treated animals had higher percentages of Ly5.1+ donor splenocytes than animals treated with vehicle alone (16.9% vs. 10.4%, 63% increase, P = 0.013). Animals treated with the CD10/NEP inhibitor also had relatively more Ly5.1+ splenic B (B220+) cells than vehicle-treated animals (14.4% vs. 8.2%, 75% increase, P = 0.018). To more specifically characterize the effects of CD10/NEP inhibition on B-cell differentiation, Ly5.1+ splenocytes from animals treated with SCH32615 or vehicle alone were analyzed for coexpression of B220 and sIgM. Animals treated with the CD10/NEP inhibitor had a significantly higher percentage of mature donor B cells (Ly5.1+ B220+ sIgM+, 10.2% vs. 5.2%, 90% increase, P = 0.006) and a more modest relative increase in immature donor B cells (Ly5.1+ B220+ sIgM-, 4.7% vs. 3.4%, 38% increase, P = not significant). Taken together, these results suggest that CD10/NEP inhibition promotes the reconstitution and maturation of splenic B cells. Therefore, CD10/NEP may function to regulate B-cell ontogeny in vivo by hydrolyzing a peptide substrate that stimulates B-cell proliferation and/or differentiation.","['Salles, G', 'Rodewald, H R', 'Chin, B S', 'Reinherz, E L', 'Shipp, M A']","['Salles G', 'Rodewald HR', 'Chin BS', 'Reinherz EL', 'Shipp MA']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Dipeptides)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '83861-02-3 (SCH 32615)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Dipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Lymph Nodes/enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neprilysin/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Spleen/enzymology/immunology']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.16.7618 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Aug 15;90(16):7618-22. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.16.7618.,['CA49232/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC47193,

A 250-bp PDGF-B gene promoter attached to a reporter gene was shown to reproduce this TPA-induced activation. In a series of mutants that we constructed, a 10-bp linker sequence was systematically moved across the 250-bp PDGF-B promoter sequence, and the effect upon luciferase reporter activity was measured to identify a site through which this TPA-induced transcriptional activation occurred. We identified a site, which we named the SIS proximal element (SPE), at positions -58 to -39 relative to the PDGF-B mRNA initiation site that was essential for the TPA-induced activation. The SPE site contains two repeated sequences (TCTC and CACC) arranged in an ABBA configuration. The SPE sequence was not found in the existing list of consensus sequences for transcription factor binding sites. Gel mobility-shift assays using an SPE oligonucleotide and K562 cell nuclear extracts showed three shifted complexes, one of which was formed only following TPA treatment of K562 cells. In a time-course study, TPA induction of the endogenous PDGF-B mRNA and formation of the TPA-inducible complex occurred over the same time frame, and both events were specifically blocked by the addition of cycloheximide. The 20-bp SPE sequence was highly conserved (19/20) in both the cat and the mouse PDGF-B promoter, and conserved portions of the SPE sequence were also found at two sites within the human PDGF-A promoter. The role of the SPE in regulating the concurrent expression of the PDGF-B and PDGF-A genes in megakaryocytes, as well as various human tumor cells, is considered.","['Jin, H M', 'Brady, M L', 'Fahl, W E']","['Jin HM', 'Brady ML', 'Fahl WE']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cats', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'TATA Box', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.90.16.7563 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1993 Aug 15;90(16):7563-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.90.16.7563.,"['P30-CA07175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-CA42024/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['PDGFB', 'SIS']",,,,,,PMC47182,

Previous work has led to the hypothesis that expression of the immunoglobulin mu heavy chain induces rearrangement activity at the kappa light-chain locus. To examine this issue in more detail, we isolated five matched pairs of mu- and endogenously rearranged mu+ cell lines from the Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pro-B-cell line K.40. In four of the five mu+ cell lines, substantial expression of mu protein on the cell surface was observed, and this correlated with an enhanced frequency of kappa immunoglobulin gene rearrangement compared with that in the matched mu- cell lines. This increased kappa gene rearrangement frequency was not due to a general increase in the amount of V(D)J recombinase activity in the mu+ cells. Consistently, introduction of a functionally rearranged mu gene into one of the mu- pre-B-cell lines resulted in a fivefold increase in kappa gene rearrangements. In three of the four clonally matched pairs with increased kappa gene rearrangements, the increase in rearrangement frequency was not accompanied by a significant increase in germ line transcripts from the C kappa locus. However, in the fourth pair, K.40D, we observed an increase in germ line transcription of the kappa locus after expression of mu protein encoded by either an endogenously rearranged or a transfected functional heavy-chain allele. In these cells, the amount of the germ line C kappa transcript correlated with the measured frequency of rearranged kappa genes. These results support a regulated model of B-cell development in which mu protein expression in some way targets the V(D)J recombinase to the kappa gene locus.","['Shapiro, A M', 'Schlissel, M S', 'Baltimore, D', 'DeFranco, A L']","['Shapiro AM', 'Schlissel MS', 'Baltimore D', 'DeFranco AL']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0448.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (integron integrase IntI1)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', '*Integrases', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinases', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.9.5679-5690.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Sep;13(9):5679-90. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.9.5679-5690.1993.,['NIGMS MSTP GM07618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC360301,

However, a number of stroma-independent (ELM-I) mutants that vary in their ability to differentiate in vitro in response to erythropoietin and interleukin-3 have been derived. We have attempted to define the genetic changes responsible for these different phenotypes. At the p53 locus in the primary leukemic cells, one copy of the gene has been lost whereas the other contains an 18-bp depletion, implicating its mutation as an early step in the development of the leukemia. Changes in ets gene expression have also been found. The Fli-1 gene region is rearranged in the primary tumor because of the insertion of a retrovirus inserted upstream of one Fli-1 allele, but this does not result in Fli-1 gene activation in any of the ELM-D or ELM-I cell lines except one. It seems significant that this line is the only one to have lost the ability to differentiate in response to erythropoietin. In addition, up-regulation of erg is associated with stromal cell-independent growth, since all ELM-I mutants have moderate levels of erg mRNA, whereas only low or undetectable levels are found in primary leukemic cells in vivo or in ELM-D cells in vitro. This up-regulation of erg mRNA seems to be important for stromal cell-independent growth, since ELM-D cells show elevated expression of the erg gene after separation from stromal cells. This seems to be made permanent in ELM-I mutants, since they do not down-regulate erg mRNA when grown in contact with stromal cells. We therefore propose that ets family members regulate both the survival and differentiation of erythroid cells.","['Nibbs, R J', 'Itoh, K', 'Ostertag, W', 'Harrison, P R']","['Nibbs RJ', 'Itoh K', 'Ostertag W', 'Harrison PR']","['Cancer Research Campaign Beatson Laboratories, Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Bearsden, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, p53', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.13.9.5582-5592.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1993 Sep;13(9):5582-92. doi: 10.1128/mcb.13.9.5582-5592.1993.,,,"['Fli-1', 'erg', 'ets-1', 'ets-2', 'p53']",,,,,,PMC360280,

DESIGN: After a brief description of the mode of action of 6MP and the formulation, pharmacokinetics, and history of its intravenous administration, the rationale for current use of intravenous 6MP infusion is explained. Subsequently, the review summarizes and discusses clinical experience with intravenous 6MP alone and in combination with intravenous methotrexate (Mtx) and cytarabine (Ara-C). RESULTS: Although still an investigative drug, intravenous 6MP has been used for 40 years and currently is being administered extensively to children with previously untreated acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) in frontline protocol studies. The reasons are the better and more consistent bioavailability of intravenous versus oral MP, higher blood and CSF levels, compliance, and preliminary evidence suggesting superior remission experience for intravenous Mtx and 6MP than for Mtx alone. The apparent lack of late adverse sequelae with 6MP as compared with other antileukemia drugs adds to this interest. CONCLUSION: The new life of intravenous 6MP at age 40 years illustrates the need for continued investigation of significant anticancer drugs as insights and technology progress.","['Pinkel, D']",['Pinkel D'],"['Division of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mercaptopurine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1826 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1826-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1826.,,,,,,39,,,,

DESIGN: The preclinical results that have led to the clinical use of IL-2 in acute leukemia will be reviewed. The clinical data obtained with the administration of IL-2 to acute leukemia patients in different phases of their disease will be discussed, together with the clinicohematologic and immunologic modifications induced following the infusion of IL-2. Finally, the possibility that limitations associated with the exogenous administration of high-dose IL-2 may be circumvented by engineering techniques aimed at inserting the IL-2 gene directly into the tumor cells, will be addressed. RESULTS: The data indicate that high-dose IL-2 may be administered to acute leukemia patients. Toxicity, recorded in all patients, appears to be controllable using a continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion protocol based on a daily dose-escalating administration. Complete remissions have been documented in acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) with a limited, but detectable proportion of residual marrow blasts. Numerous phenotypic and functional changes have been recorded within the immune system of the host. Using retroviral vectors, the IL-2 gene may be productively transduced into human acute leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSION: IL-2 appears to represent a therapeutic option for AML patients with limited/minimal residual disease. The results of the ongoing randomized trials in patients in first or second remission are awaited.","['Foa, R']",['Foa R'],"['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Sezione di Clinica Medica, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1817 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1817-25. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1817.,,,,,,78,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We measured ASNase activity (spectrophotometric assay) in serum samples obtained from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at various times during their therapy with intramuscular ASNase. ASNase protein was measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Studies following the initial dose of Escherichia coli-derived ASNase demonstrated no difference in apparent t1/2 following 25,000 IU/m2 versus 2,500 IU/m2 (1.24 v 1.35 days, P = .2). The apparent t1/2s following maintenance doses of E coli ASNase (middle dose t1/2, 1.28 days, or last dose t1/2, 1.14 days) showed no difference when compared with the initial dose of ASNase (P = .3 to .9). There was no significant difference between the apparent t1/2s of ASNase activity and ASNase protein (n = 8, P = .2 to .6). The serum t1/2 was 0.65 and 5.73 days for patients receiving Erwinia or polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified E coli ASNase, respectively, as the induction dose. ASNase activity was undetectable in sera of four patients studied in the week following an anaphylactic reaction to E coli ASNase and the t1/2 was significantly shorter in five patients with a history of allergic reaction to E coli ASNase who were studied following a dose of PEG ASNase, (t1/2, 1.80 days). CONCLUSION: We conclude that (1) the apparent t1/2 of ASNase is dependent on enzyme preparation used, but is not affected by dose or by repeated use; (2) the apparent t1/2 of E coli ASNase as a protein is the same as the apparent t1/2 of enzymatic activity; and (3) patients who have had a hypersensitivity reaction to E coli ASNase have a decreased apparent t1/2 with both E coli and PEG ASNase.","['Asselin, B L', 'Whitin, J C', 'Coppola, D J', 'Rupp, I P', 'Sallan, S E', 'Cohen, H J']","['Asselin BL', 'Whitin JC', 'Coppola DJ', 'Rupp IP', 'Sallan SE', 'Cohen HJ']","[""Strong Children's Research Center, University of Rochester, NY.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Asparaginase/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/etiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erwinia/enzymology', 'Escherichia coli/enzymology', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1780 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1993 Sep;11(9):1780-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1993.11.9.1780.,"['00199-03/PHS HHS/United States', '5P01CA34183-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA11199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The causes of these increases remain unknown. Efforts should proceed to identify those occupational groups with increases in the same sites, as these may indicate relevant exposures. Two analyses were undertaken: trends in cancer mortality in industrial countries were reviewed to identify recently increasing sites and summaries were compiled of studies on farmers which have shown increased risks for these same sites of cancer. Using data provided by the World Health Organization, age-specific rates were developed for a number of sites of cancer from 1968 to 1986. Trends in the ratio of male to female cancer mortality were also assessed for several of these countries. Based on a literature review by the National Cancer Institute, patterns of cancer in farmers reported in 20 studies from 8 countries are summarized, weighting each study by its size to create combined relative risks. In industrial countries, rates of cancer mortality increased for a number of sites, including melanoma, prostate, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, breast, brain, and kidney cancer. The ratio of male to female cancer mortality (for all sites of cancer excluding lung) has generally increased in several countries during this same time period. Many of the same sites that have increased in the general population have also been found to be increasing in farmers. Significant excesses occurred for Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, leukemia, skin melanomas, and cancers of the lip, stomach, and prostate.

The amplified DNA fragment to be studied is biotinylated at the 5' end of one of the two oligonucleotide primers used for amplification, allowing coupling to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. The immobilized double-stranded DNA is then separated into single strands by alkaline treatment. A 5'-biotinylated sequencing primer is used after saturating with a biotin solution any possible remaining affinity sites on the streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Sequencing is performed by using T7 DNA polymerase, and the sequencing products are electrophoresed in denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. After transfer of the products to a nylon membrane, the sequencing pattern is revealed by chemiluminescence.

We have previously mapped the translocation breakpoints of t(8;21) in a specific intron of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21. In this study, we cloned cDNAs synthesized from a cell line carrying t(8;21) by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using an AML1-specific primer. The analysis of the cDNAs structure has led to the identification of the fusion of AML1 with a gene named MTG8 on chromosome 8, which seems to be identical to ETO. Northern analysis using MTG8 (ETO) probes detected 7.8-kb and 6.2-kb RNAs and several minor RNAs in the cell line with t(8;21), but failed to detect any transcripts in a cell line without t(8;21). A set of primers were designed to detect the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion by PCR. The PCR amplified identical products in all 6 patients and one cell line with t(8;21), suggesting that the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion is a constant feature associated with t(8;21) and the junctions of the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion are restricted in a unique site. Because the PCR detection of the AML1/MTG8(ETO) fusion at the RNA level is highly sensitive, it can be used as a sensitive method for diagnosis and detection of minimal residual disease in t(8;21) leukemia.","['Kozu, T', 'Miyoshi, H', 'Shimizu, K', 'Maseki, N', 'Kaneko, Y', 'Asou, H', 'Kamada, N', 'Ohki, M']","['Kozu T', 'Miyoshi H', 'Shimizu K', 'Maseki N', 'Kaneko Y', 'Asou H', 'Kamada N', 'Ohki M']","['Department of Immunology and Virology, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84087-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1270-6.,,,"['AML1', 'MTG8']","['GENBANK/D14822', 'GENBANK/D14823']",,,,,,

As a protective mechanism, cells express antioxidant enzymes including manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), copper-zinc SOD (Cu/Zn-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSX-PX). Even though hematopoietic cells are a major source of oxidants, little is known of their expression of antioxidants. We found that seven myeloid leukemic cell lines blocked at different stages of differentiation constitutively expressed Mn-SOD, Cu/Zn-SOD, and GSX-PX RNAs. Level of Mn-SOD activities paralleled levels of Mn-SOD RNA. Terminal differentiation of native HL-60 cells to either granulocytes or macrophages did not alter levels of Mn-SOD RNA but markedly decreased cell division. Myeloid leukemic lines sensitive to cytotoxic effects of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) as well as normal peripheral blood lymphocytes and monocytes, dramatically increased their levels of Mn-SOD RNA in the presence of TNF. In contrast, Cu/Zn-SOD and GSX-PX RNA levels did not increase in these same cells. TNF-resistant leukemic lines had higher constitutive levels of Mn-SOD RNA and activity; and these levels did not change in the presence of TNF. Antisense but not random oligonucleotides to Mn-SOD markedly increased the sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of TNF for both the native HL-60 (TNF-sensitive) and K562 (TNF-resistant) cell lines. Further studies showed that the antisense oligonucleotides entered the cells and resulted in decreased levels of Mn-SOD RNA. The data suggest that Mn-SOD may provide protection against cytotoxicity of TNF in hematopoietic cells.","['Kizaki, M', 'Sakashita, A', 'Karmakar, A', 'Lin, C W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kizaki M', 'Sakashita A', 'Karmakar A', 'Lin CW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/analysis/*genetics', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Superoxide Dismutase/analysis/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84071-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1142-50.,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK41936/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Prothymosin alpha mRNA and/or peptide levels increase when cells are stimulated to proliferate. Because proliferation and differentiation events are often inversely correlated, we examined prothymosin alpha gene expression during proliferation and differentiation of HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. Steady-state levels of prothymosin alpha mRNA, which are high in exponentially growing HL-60, decrease within hours after induction of HL-60 to differentiate along the neutrophil pathway with dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or along the macrophage lineage with either tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) or bryostatin 1. The decline in prothymosin alpha mRNA in response to these differentiation signals parallels that of c-myc mRNA under the same conditions. We then determined whether the downregulation of prothymosin alpha and c-myc mRNA were due to differentiation or cessation or proliferation. Recombinant human gamma-interferon induces monocytic differentiation of HL-60, but permits continued proliferation, and, under these conditions, expression of prothymosin alpha, as well as of c-myc, mRNA remains elevated. We conclude that prothymosin alpha and c-myc expression are coregulated in differentiating HL-60 and that their expression correlates with the proliferative state of HL-60 cells, rather than with the differentiated state.","['Smith, M R', 'al-Katib, A', 'Mohammad, R', 'Silverman, A', 'Szabo, P', 'Khilnani, S', 'Kohler, W', 'Nath, R', 'Mutchnick, M G']","['Smith MR', 'al-Katib A', 'Mohammad R', 'Silverman A', 'Szabo P', 'Khilnani S', 'Kohler W', 'Nath R', 'Mutchnick MG']","['Department of Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201-1998.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (prothymosin alpha)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84069-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1127-32.,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,

In the presence of recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6), serum sgp130 were capable of associating with serum sIL-6R. By the sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, healthy human sera was shown to contain 390 +/- 72 ng/mL of sgp130. A mouse pro-B-cell line-derived transfectant, BAF-130, expressing human gp130 was used to examine the function of serum sgp130. When supplemented with rIL-6, human serum induced DNA synthesis in BAF-130 cells, whereas the serum deprived of sIL-6R did not. In contrast, the DNA synthesis induced in BAF-130 cells by rIL-6-supplemented serum was increased when the serum was deprived of sgp130. These results indicated that serum sgp130 could negatively regulate the IL-6 signal. Recently, gp130 has been shown to be involved in the signaling processes of oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, and ciliary neurotropic factor, in addition to those of IL-6. Recombinant sgp130 showed inhibitory effect on the biologic function of such cytokines.

Its presence has been associated with a poor prognosis, which may be overcome with more intensive therapy. Although leukemic cells from cases of t(1;19)-ALL frequently express cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, their complete antigenic profile remains undefined. Among 697 consecutive cases of B-precursor ALL with complete phenotypic studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, 22 cases were found to carry the t(1;19). Twenty of 22 cases had an identical, complex phenotype characterized by homogeneous expression of CD19, CD10, and CD9; complete absence of CD34; and at least partial absence of CD20. Overall, this phenotype was seen in only 8.0% (56 of 697) of childhood B-precursor ALL. One of the two remaining t(1;19)-carrying cases conformed to this phenotype, but was lacking data for CD9. The other case differed by virtue of expression of CD34 and was also hyperdiploid with 55 chromosomes. Molecular studies showed E2A-PBX1 abnormalities in all examined cases (12 of 12) with the t(1;19), including the case lacking CD9 data. In contrast, no E2A-PBX1 abnormalities were detected in the sole t(1;19)-ALL with CD34 expression. Seventeen cases with the characteristic phenotype and uninformative cytogenetics were also molecularly analyzed and 5 of 17 (including 4 of 8 with unsatisfactory cytogenetics and 1 of 9 with a normal karyotype) contained E2A gene rearrangements and E2A-PBX1 fusion mRNAs. Our results show that all cases of t(1;19)-ALL with concomitant E2A-PBX1 fusion invariably express a characteristic but uncommon profile of surface antigens. These observations suggest that selective molecular analysis of a small subset of patients (those with uninformative cytogenetics and the characteristic phenotype) can identify a significant number of additional cases of ALL with E2A-PBX1 fusion that might benefit from more intensive therapy.","['Borowitz, M J', 'Hunger, S P', 'Carroll, A J', 'Shuster, J J', 'Pullen, D J', 'Steuber, C P', 'Cleary, M L']","['Borowitz MJ', 'Hunger SP', 'Carroll AJ', 'Shuster JJ', 'Pullen DJ', 'Steuber CP', 'Cleary ML']","['Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84063-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1086-91.,"['1F32 CA 09184-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 429971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,"['E2A', 'PBX1']",,,,,,,

To further evaluate the 4q21 gene and its role in t(4;11) acute leukemia, we have cloned a 38-kb genomic region and mapped exons of the AF-4 gene. The 4q21 breakpoints in 19 cases of t(4;11) acute leukemia were analyzed by Southern analysis and pulsed-field gels. Seventeen of the 19 cases had breakpoints on chromosome 4q21 that were scattered in this 38 kb region. Expression of the AF-4 gene was studied in a total of 28 various nonhematopoietic, hematopoietic, and t(4;11) leukemic cell lines. The AF-4 gene was expressed in all cell lines as a major and a minor transcript. In addition to the normal transcripts, two fusion transcripts from the derivative 11 and derivative 4 chromosomes were identified in all t(4;11) cell lines except B1, which had only the der(11) transcript. These findings suggest that the breakpoints on 4q21 cluster over a broader area than do the breakpoints in the 11q23 gene, and that der(11) encodes the fusion RNA found consistently in leukemia cells.","['Chen, C S', 'Hilden, J M', 'Frestedt, J', 'Domer, P H', 'Moore, R', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Kersey, J H']","['Chen CS', 'Hilden JM', 'Frestedt J', 'Domer PH', 'Moore R', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Kersey JH']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine/Pathology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84062-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1080-5.,['R35 CA49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,"['AF-4', 'FEL']",,,,,,,

In this report, the expression of GATA-1, GATA-2, and GATA-3 has been examined in enriched peripheral blood progenitors before and after culture in a well-characterized liquid culture system. In addition primary leukemic cells as well as several erythroleukemic and nonerythroid cell lines were analyzed for GATA factor expression. The results show that the profile of GATA factor expression in erythroid cells is distinct from that of myeloid or lymphoid lineages. Erythroleukemic cell lines express little or no GATA-3, but high levels of GATA-1 and GATA-2. When they are induced to display the terminal erythroid phenotype, little change in the level of GATA-1 is detected but a significant decline in the levels of GATA-2 is observed commensurate with the degree of maturation achieved by the cells. Enrichment of erythroid progenitors from peripheral blood leads to selection of cells that express both GATA-1 and GATA-2. As the enriched populations are cultured in suspension in the presence of multiple cytokines, the levels of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 initially increase. However, in cultures containing only erythropoietin, which show exclusive erythroid differentiation, the levels of GATA-1 continue to increase, whereas GATA-2 expression declines as erythroid maturation progresses. In contrast, cultures lacking Epo (ie, with interleukin-3 and kit ligand) display limited progression towards both the myeloid and erythroid pathways, and high levels of expression of both GATA-1 and GATA-2 are maintained. Despite the initial upregulation of GATA-1 expression in the latter cultures, terminal erythroid differentiation does not occur in the absence of erythropoietin. These results indicate that GATA-1 upregulation is associated with both the initiation and the maintenance of the erythroid program, but that these two processes appear to be under separate regulatory control. Thus, the dynamic changes in the levels of different GATA factors that occur during primary erythroid differentiation suggest that the levels of these factors may influence the progression to specific hematopoietic pathways.","['Leonard, M', 'Brice, M', 'Engel, J D', 'Papayannopoulou, T']","['Leonard M', 'Brice M', 'Engel JD', 'Papayannopoulou T']","['Division of Hematology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', '*Erythropoiesis', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/genetics']",1993/08/15 00:00,1993/08/15 00:01,['1993/08/15 00:00'],"['1993/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84061-0 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1993 Aug 15;82(4):1071-9.,"['DK30852/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM28846/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL46557/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Comparison with the d and d,l-leucovorin.",1-5,"BACKGROUND: The active isomer of leucovorin (LV), LV-6S was compared with the racemic form, LV-6R,S and the inactive form, LV-6R. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pharmacokinetic studies of LV-6S and 6R,S were performed on normal volunteers and patients. Growth of Pediococcus Cerevisiae (PC), a LV-dependent strain, was measured with the 3 forms of LV. CCRF-CEM, a leukemic human cell line, was used to compare the effect of LV-6S, 6R,S and 6R on the rescue of methotrexate (MTX) and on the cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). RESULTS: LV-6S exhibits pharmacokinetic patterns similar to those obtained with LV-6R,S whatever the route used, oral or intravenous. The growth of PC was similar with the active isomer and the racemic form while the unnatural isomer, LV-6R did not promote any growth. Cells exposed to MTX (10(-7) to 10(-5) M) were rescued from MTX cytotoxicity with LV-6S and LV-6R,S at concentrations 100 and 200 fold higher, whereas LV-6R did not reverse toxic effects of MTX. An enhancement of the cytotoxicity induced by 5-FU (10(-4) M) was obtained after preexposure of cells to LV-6S or LV-6R,S while LV-6R did not exhibit any synergistic effect. CONCLUSION: LV-6S has similar effects to LV-6R,S in vitro and in vivo but at half doses; its clinical use prevents the possible interference of the inactive isomer, especially in patients receiving high doses of LV.","['Zittoun, J']",['Zittoun J'],"[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie-Immunologie, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/chemistry/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/toxicity', 'Pediococcus/drug effects/growth & development', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/annonc/4.suppl_2.s1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1993;4 Suppl 2:1-5. doi: 10.1093/annonc/4.suppl_2.s1.,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Here, the clinical experience with and side effects of fludarabine are reported in 19 patients with refractory CLL (17 B-CLL, 2 T-CLL). All patients were pretreated with one to four different regimens and had progressive disease. Fludarabine was administered at a dosage of 25 mg/m2 daily for 5 days as a 30-minute intravenous infusion. This course was repeated every fifth week. Dosage and time course were adapted to toxicity. RESULTS: 12/18 (67%) evaluable patients achieved partial remissions (PR), 1/18 (6%) had stable disease (SD) and 5/18 (28%) were progressive. The median duration of partial remission until relapse or death was 6 months. Most responses to fludarabine occurred within two treatment courses. Major toxic effects included infections in 11 patients and nausea in 8 (mainly grade 1). Meanwhile, three patients died of progressive disease and 8 of pneumonias or other infections. Two patients had pneumocystis carinii pneumonias and one an aspergillus pneumonia. The high infection rate may be due not only to hypogammaglobulinaemia or fludarabine-induced granulocytopenia but also to a remarkable decrease of CD4(+)-cells during fludarabine therapy. In one case a tumor lysis syndrome was observed. No CNS toxicity was noted. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that fludarabine is effective even in patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory to multiple chemotherapy regimens. However, fludarabine has a remarkable suppressive effect on T-lymphocytes, predominantly CD4(+)-lymphocytes. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended.","['Bergmann, L', 'Fenchel, K', 'Jahn, B', 'Mitrou, P S', 'Hoelzer, D']","['Bergmann L', 'Fenchel K', 'Jahn B', 'Mitrou PS', 'Hoelzer D']","['Department of Internal Medicine, J.

Since we have previously shown apoptosis to occur in HL-60 leukemic cells exposed to the prodrug Mafosfamide (ASTA Z 7557), the present study was undertaken to examine the levels of c-myc mRNA transcripts in such cells. Mafosfamide, which is a cyclophosphamide derivative that rapidly generates 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide after aqueous dissolution, was employed in doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 micrograms/ml. No changes in c-myc mRNA levels were evident after 1 hour of exposure to Mafosfamide. After 6 and 24 hours of Mafosfamide-exposure, however, there was a dose- and time-dependent decrease in c-myc transcripts. c-myc mRNA expression was reduced to a greater extent than was either beta-actin of GAPDH expression.

The stimulation activity of the polymers strongly depended on the amount of hydrogen peroxide used during sample preparation, and on the temperature during iodination assay. These polymers also stimulated the production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. On the other hand, neither iodination nor cytokine production was significantly affected by the phenylpropenoid monomers. Although the polymers stimulated the iodination of human leukemic cell lines (HL-60, ML-1), they did not induce cytokine production in these cells.

Because patients with -7 have a poor prognosis, their identification is important for treatment planning. Conventionally, -7 is detected by the G-banding technique. This study examines the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) methodology to detect -7 cells in interphase nuclei and metaphase chromosomes. Fifteen AML or MDS patients whose leukemic cells were found to have -7 by G-banding at disease presentation were studied. In 13 of these patients, -7 could be detected in interphase by FISH using a chromosome 7-specific centromeric DNA probe. The two patients whose leukemic cells were not detectable by interphase FISH had -7 and t(1q;7p), which were detectable by FISH in metaphase using a chromosome 7-specific painting probe. Metaphase FISH was particularly useful in further defining chromosome 7 defects in cells that contained aberrant or marker chromosomes. For example, in 6 patients, chromosome 7 sequences were detectable in aberrant or marker chromosomes by metaphase FISH, but not by G-banding. These results suggest that metaphase FISH is an important adjunct to conventional cytogenetic methods for defining chromosome 7 abnormalities in AML and MDS patients. Furthermore, interphase FISH is useful for follow-up studies in patients who are found informative for the FISH study at presentation.","['Zhao, L', 'van Oort, J', 'Cork, A', 'Liang, J C']","['Zhao L', 'van Oort J', 'Cork A', 'Liang JC']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas, M.

All-trans retinoic acid was used to induce these patients to differentiation. In the early period of induction there were risks of severe hemorrhage, which was the main cause of early death. Treatments combined with platelets and heparin or aminomethylbenzoic (PAMBA) were given to patients with abnormal coagulation. As a result only 4 out of 43 patients died of intracranial bleeding at 4-12 days when their white blood cell (WBC) counts peaked. The combination of retinoic acid (RA) and HA chemotherapy could reduce hyperleukocytosis during the RA induction course. None of 7 patients died at early stage with this treatment combination. Our studies showed that it could predict the onset of remission at early stage through observations on the successive changes of karyotypes and morphology of the bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. Our studies also showed that the growth of CFU-F could be inhibited by RA. We think that it may play a role in the RA-induced differentiation.

Using a panel of monoclonal antibodies to myelomonocytic surface antigens (MMSA) and flow cytometry, we studied bone marrow cells from 26 patients with MDS of all five FAB subtypes. The MMSA studied included Ia (HLA-DR), CD11b (Mo1), CD14 (Mo2, My4), CD13 (My7), and CD33 (My9). Marrows were considered ""positive"" for a given MMSA if the percentage of reactive cells exceeded the upper limit of the normal range. Twenty-four of twenty-six patients (92.3%) were CD13 (My7)+, suggesting that CD13 may serve as a diagnostic marker for MDS. Ten of twelve patients who developed ANLL during a median follow-up of 44 weeks were Ia(HLA-DR)+. The Kaplan-Meier estimated median time to leukemia (TTL) was 16 weeks for Ia+ patients and 88 weeks for Ia- patients (P = 0.004). All six patients who developed ANLL before 16 weeks from diagnosis were Ia+, while none of the Ia- patients converted to ANLL before 24 weeks. Nine of thirteen patients with low CD11b (Mo1) expression (< 53% reactive cells) developed ANLL, compared with only two of 11 patients with high CD11b expression (> 53% reactive cells). Kaplan-Meier estimated TTL was 29 weeks for patients with low CD11b, compared to 160 weeks for patients with high CD11b (P < 0.05). Patients who met both criteria, Ia+ and low CD11b, represented the poorest prognostic subgroup, with median TTL of 13 weeks compared with 88 weeks for the others (P = 0.017). Ia and CD11b patterns were not specific for MDS subtype, and their expression did not correlate with blast count. These data suggest that MDS patients whose bone marrow cells demonstrate high Ia (HLA-DR) and low CD11b (Mo1) expression represent a poor prognostic subgroup with short TTL. These patients may be candidates for early aggressive or investigational treatment.","['Mittelman, M', 'Karcher, D S', 'Kammerman, L A', 'Lessin, L S']","['Mittelman M', 'Karcher DS', 'Kammerman LA', 'Lessin LS']","['Department of Medicine, George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830430302 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1993 Jul;43(3):165-71. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830430302.,,,,,,34,,,,

The objective of the present work was to attempt an estimate, as regards time and amount, for transfusion of blood derivates. The authors analyzed 100 cycles of aggressive chemotherapy with regard to changes of the haemogram. The group was divided arbitrarily with regard to the initial value of different components of the haemogram and for these portions of the group a time schedule of check-up examinations of the haemogram and of the assumed time of indication of transfusion of blood derivates was elaborated. In patients with an initial values of red blood cells above 3.5 x 10(12)/l the first transfusion is usually needed on the 8th day after the beginning of chemotherapy, in patients with a values lower than 3.0 x 10(12)/l after the initial supplementation a further drop may be expected already on the 4th day.

In 4 patients differences in the SIg phenotypes were found when cells from blood, bone marrow and lymph nodes were examined. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were characterized as a monoclonal B cell population whereas in the marrow or lymph node lymphocytes a tendency toward poly-clonality was found. We suggest that these differences reflect the origin of the initial leukaemic transformation: intra versus extra-medullar. In case of intramedullary origin of leukaemia the transformed clone infiltrates subsequently lymph nodes or other lymphoid structures. In leukaemia of extra-medullar origin the bone marrow is infiltrated later and therefore the tendency toward polyclonal SIg picture of the bone marrow lymphocytes contrasts with the monoclonality of the peripheral blood cells.","['Rupniewska, Z', 'Wach, M']","['Rupniewska Z', 'Wach M']",['Kliniki Hematologii AM w Lublinie.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1993/04/01 00:00,1993/04/01 00:01,['1993/04/01 00:00'],"['1993/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 1993 Apr;89(4):304-14.,,,,,,,,"Badania powierzchniowych immunoglobulin limfocytow krwi obwodowej, szpiku i wezla chlonnego chorych z przewlekla bialaczka limfatyczna B komorkowa.",,

Maximal specificity is presumably achieved when the DNA sequences amplified are truly leukaemia-specific, such as BCR/ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia, RARA PML/RARA in t(15;17) acute myelogenous leukemia, DEK/CAN in t(6;9) AML, PBX1/E2A in t(1;19) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or TAL-1 deletions in other T-ALLs. Comparable sensitivity may be achieved by using immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) and T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements if a clonospecific probe can be generated. However, the presence of similar sequences in IgH genes from normal B lymphocytes may decrease the specificity. For clinical purposes the crucial issues are the following. Can PCR techniques be used for confirmation of diagnosis and evaluation of extent of disease? Can PCR data obtained in remission provide information about the probability of cure or of relapse? Can techniques be developed to quantitate the PCR product and thereby increase its predictive value?

Whereas two of the three IgH sequences isolated from the leukemic cells at CNS relapse were identical to sequences originally isolated from the marrow lymphoblasts at diagnosis, the third CNS sequence was similar but not identical to the third marrow sequence. The third IgH sequence identified in the CNS differed from the marrow sequence only at the variable gene segment adjoining the CDRIII. Using a detection method based on the polymerase chain reaction, the altered IgH sequence identified in the leukemic cells from the cerebrospinal fluid was noted to be present in the CNS at a higher frequency than the related diagnostic sequence and was not detected in the marrow either at diagnosis or at CNS relapse.

So far, the mode of action is unknown. A resistant subline (BNML/ACD-R) was developed in vivo in the BNML model. Leukemic rats received repeated oral administrations of ACD. When the leukemia relapsed after initial remission-induction with ACD, the cells were transferred to new recipients which were again treated. In total, the animals received 247 oral administrations of ACD (33 x 2 mg/kg per day and 214 x 5 mg/kg per day) before full resistance was reached. The cell line was transferred 17 times in total. Treatment of the final resistant cell line with therapeutically highly active doses of 23.7 mg/kg per day and 11.85 mg/kg per day ACD for 5 days, that resulted in an increase of life span (ILS) of 57 and 18 days, respectively, when applied to the sensitive parent BNML line (BNML/S), resulted in only 10 and 3 days ILS, respectively. These results indicate that a significant degree of resistance has been achieved, which can be overcome partially by increasing the dose of ACD. Whether the development of a resistant subpopulation of the BNML is a result of acquired resistance or whether a naturally resistant subpopulation has been selected out after prolonged treatment with ACD remains to be established.

We now describe studies in a murine model of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in which we tested whether bone marrow, contaminated with malignant T cells and purged ex vivo with araG, could reconstitute both the lymphoid and myeloerythroid lineages in the absence of leukemic relapse. The model utilized 6C3HED tumor cells, derived from a Thy 1.2+ malignant murine T-cell line, which were shown to cause lethal leukemia in C3H/HeN mice. Intravenous injection of 10(6) 6C3HED cells resulted in 100% mortality within 18 days, with autopsy revealing tumor infiltration of multiple organs. 100% of non-leukemia bearing lethally irradiated C3H/HeN mice transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow, treated ex vivo with 100 microM of araG for 18 hours, survived > 365 days post-transplant with full lymphohematopoietic reconstitution. Evidence of araG's ability to purge bone marrow of malignant tumor cells without causing significant toxicity to normal marrow derived hematopoietic progenitor cells was documented in experiments in which 75% of lethally irradiated mice transplanted with syngeneic bone marrow, contaminated with 6C3HED tumor cells and treated ex vivo with 100 microM araG for 18 hours, survived for > 250 to > 400 days. Death in 25% of mice was secondary to infection which developed before marrow reconstitution occurred. Reconstitution of the lymphoid, myeloid, and erythroid lineages with donor cells in surviving mice was documented. The data presented indicate that araG may effectively purge bone marrow of malignant T cells without irreversible toxicity to hematopoietic stem cells. This purging regimen is recommended for consideration for clinical trials in patients with T-cell malignancies undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation and may also be a viable option for T-cell depletion as a strategy to prevent graft-versus-host disease.","['Gravatt, L C', 'Chaffee, S', 'Hebert, M E', 'Halperin, E C', 'Friedman, H S', 'Kurtzberg, J']","['Gravatt LC', 'Chaffee S', 'Hebert ME', 'Halperin EC', 'Friedman HS', 'Kurtzberg J']","['Department of Pediatrics, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '38819-10-2 (9-arabinofuranosylguanine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Arabinonucleosides/*pharmacology/toxicity', '*Bone Marrow Purging', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*pathology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1261-7.,"['3R25CA17987-1251/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P01AI19368-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44640/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Differentiation is not induced in the absence of serum or when antibodies to tumor necrosis factor-alpha and transforming growth factor-beta are added to the cultures, indicating that these serum-contained cytokines participate in initiating the differentiation process. The drug- and cytokine-dependent cell maturation, which results in the inhibition of leukemic cell growth, is achieved at much lower concentrations of drug than is required for growth-inhibition through drug-mediated cell kill. RNA- and protein-targeted agents cannot replace DNA-specific agents in the process of differentiation-induction. The DNA-specific agents render the leukemic cells responsive to the low concentrations of differentiation-inducing cytokines that are present in serum, causing them to mature, and subsequently, to cease growth.

Seven out 12 patients exhibited the specific 1.0 kb GM-CSF mRNA. Six from these patients presented an increased level of spontaneous megakaryocytic colony formation. Using an immunocytochemical procedure, the presence of GM-CSF was detected in a large proportion (52% to 72%) of the blast cells of the three patients studied, who were selected for the high expression of GM-CSF mRNA transcripts. Because the role of GM-CSF in the regulation of human megakaryocytopoiesis is well documented, we investigated the inhibiting effect of anti-GM-CSF antibodies on the spontaneous megakaryocytic colony growth of three of the patients expressing the GM-CSF transcript. Addition of anti-GM-CSF had a high neutralizing effect ranging from 60% to 70% inhibition of endogenous megakaryocytic colony growth. As the GM-CSF synthesis by leukemic cells is often induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1), we also investigated the effect of anti-IL-1 antibody on the spontaneous megakaryocytic colony growth of the same three patients. No significant inhibiting effect was observed, showing that the role of GM-CSF in the spontaneous colony formation is not mediated by IL-1. In addition, patients who constitutively expressed the GM-CSF transcript and showed endogenous megakaryocytic colony growth were those having a significantly higher platelet count than the group of patients without GM-CSF transcript and with no endogenous megakaryocytic colonies. In conclusion, these results suggest that GM-CSF, but not IL-1, participates in the production of spontaneous megakaryocytic colony formation observed in some CML patients.

This suggests that p210bcr-abl in mature granulocytes has no tyrosine kinase activity, or it is extremely weak, and dephosphorylation of p210bcr-abl is associated with differential maturation of immature cells in the chronic phase of CML.","['Kuwao, F', 'Takahashi, I']","['Kuwao F', 'Takahashi I']","['Cancer Institute, Kochi Prefectural Central Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1168-73.,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies on the B-lymphoid cell lineage in two patients with Ph-positive CML suggest that there may also be a clonal Ph-negative stage in CML and that the Ph-positive stage arises by subclonal expansion. To determine whether this is a frequent or a rare occurrence, 14 additional glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-heterozygous patients with CML were studied. In five of these patients there was a statistically significant excess of Ph-negative B-lymphoid cell lines expressing the same G6PD type expressed in the corresponding CML clone. In no case was an excess of B-lymphoid lines expressing the opposite G6PD type recovered.

The effects of continuous exposure of all-trans-RA, its naturally occurring isomer, 13-cis-RA, and its metabolite 4-oxo-all-trans-RA were studied on the growth of normal human bone marrow cells in soft agar, directly and after liquid culture. Retinoids enhanced the total number of granulocytic colony and macrocluster formation in the presence of exogenous colony-stimulating factor (n = 9). Dose-response curve were bell-shaped, with a maximal increment between concentration of 0.5 and 0.05 nM. In all cases, a concomitant decrease of macrophagic colonies was noted. The positive effect on granulocytic colony formation was observed with each of the retinoids tested (all-trans, 13-cis and 4-oxo-all-trans) (n = 5). On erythroid colony formation, all-trans-RA had the opposite effect. Constant suppression of CFU-E and BFU-E colony formation and coloring was observed in a dose-related fashion from 0.1 to 10 microM (n = 5). Thus, in granulocytic, as in erythroid colony formation, retinoids affected both proliferation and differentiation parameters. However, after short-term suspension culture in the presence of all-trans-RA, an increase of both CFU-GM and BFU-E colonies, was observed. These results suggest a specific effect of retinoids on late myeloid precursors and places retinoids as possible candidates for enhancement of normal granulocytic differentiation.","['Gratas, C', 'Menot, M L', 'Dresch, C', 'Chomienne, C']","['Gratas C', 'Menot ML', 'Dresch C', 'Chomienne C']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Universite Paris VII, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['38030-57-8 (4-oxoretinoic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EH28UP18IF (Isotretinoin)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Granulocytes/cytology/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isotretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",1993/08/01 00:00,1993/08/01 00:01,['1993/08/01 00:00'],"['1993/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1993 Aug;7(8):1156-62.,,['Leukemia. 1994 Jan;8(1):214-5.

The basis for the sequence specificity in these integrase-viral DNA recognition processes is unknown. Structural analogs of the disintegration substrate were made to analyze the disintegration reaction mechanism for the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) integrase (IN). Modifications in the target DNA portion of the disintegration substrate decreased enzymatic activity, while substitution of the highly conserved CA in the viral long terminal repeat portion had no effect on activity. The role of the His-Cys finger region in catalysis was addressed by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) modification of the cysteine residues of M-MuLV IN as well as by mutations. Both integration activities, 3' processing, and strand transfer, were completely inhibited by NEM modification of M-MuLV IN, while disintegration activity was only partially sensitive. However, structural analogs of the disintegration substrates that were modified in the target DNA and had the conserved CA removed were not active with NEM-treated M-MuLV IN. In addition, mutants made in the His-Cys region of M-MuLV IN were examined and found to also be completely blocked in integration but not disintegration activity.

This disease occurs in only a small minority of people infected with HTLV-I and manifests itself many years after infection. Therefore, it appears that a fine balance exists between HTLV-I and the host T-cell factors with which it interacts. HTLV-I encodes a transactivating protein, Tax, which activates viral transcription via cellular mechanisms which are incompletely understood. As viral gene expression is negligible during latency, it is doubtful that Tax controls the initial transition to the replicative state. Tax-independent cellular factors which control HTLV-I transcription, and presumably latency, have received little study. Recently, the product of the chicken proto-oncogene ets-1 has been shown to bind to the HTLV-I enhancer and modestly activate transcription in certain cell types (S. C. Gitlin, R. Bosselut, A. Gegonne, J. Ghysdael, and J. N. Brady, J. Virol. 65:5513-5523, 1991). However, the functional significance of the ets-binding site in the intact enhancer has not previously been shown. We now demonstrate that site-specific mutation of the purine-rich ets-binding site significantly diminishes inducible enhancer function, but not Tax response, in the human Jurkat T-cell line. Similarly, mutation of the peri-ets (pets) site, not previously noted in the HTLV-I enhancer, markedly inhibits inducible enhancer function but not Tax response. Further, we show that the predominant protein binding the purine-rich HTLV-I enhancer element in human T cells is not ets-1 but Elf-1, a member of the ets family which is very similar to the Drosophila morphogen E74. Regulation of HTLV-I through Elf-1/pets enhancer motifs resembles that seen with human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (D. M. Markovitz, M. Smith, J. Hilfinger, M. C. Hannibal, B. Petryniak, and G. J.

F-MuLV induces erythroleukemia preceded by severe early hemolytic anemia; M-MuLV induces thymomas and only very mild hemolysis. The major viral determinant of severe early hemolytic anemia residues in the env gene, but sequences located outside this gene can modulate this effect. By means of genetic chimeras of F- and M-MuLV, we have found that although they are confined to the 5' portion of the env gene intron, sequences that determine the distinctive hemolytic potentials of F- and M-MuLV are widely distributed over a region spanning the RNA encapsidation domain, the gag gene, and the portion of the pol gene encoding the viral protease. Within this large region, two fragments of M-MuLV, a 1.3-kb region encoding the matrix, pp12, and capsid proteins and a 0.8-kb region encoding the nucleocapsid and the viral protease, were capable, individually, of partially attenuating the capacity of F-MuLV for induction of severe early hemolytic anemia. In association, these two fragments conferred complete attenuation. Moreover, a second pair of adjacent fragments within this large region appeared to behave cooperatively to confer complete attenuation; a 0.36-kb region roughly corresponding to the encapsidation domain, although not detectably altering hemolytic potential on its own, deepened the attenuation conferred by the adjacent 1.3-kb region.

We found that the RNA in newly released virions is in a conformation different from that in mature virions, since it has a different electrophoretic mobility in nondenaturing agarose gels and dissociates into monomers at a lower temperature. On the basis of these results, we suggest that the RNA initially packaged into nascent virions is already dimeric but that the dimer undergoes a maturation process after the virus is released from the cell. In further experiments, we tested the possibility that this maturation event is linked to the maturation cleavage of the virion proteins, which is catalyzed by the viral protease (PR). We found that the dimeric RNA isolated from PR- mutant virions resembles that from immature virions: it has a lower electrophoretic mobility and a lower sedimentation rate, and it also dissociates at a lower temperature than does RNA from mature wild-type virions. When Kirsten sarcoma virus is rescued by a PR- mutant or by a somewhat leaky cysteine array mutant of MoMuLV, its RNA also exhibits a electrophoretic mobility lower than that in the wild-type pseudotype. These results suggest that the maturation of dimeric RNA in released virus particles requires the cleavage of the Gag precursor and the presence of an intact cysteine array in the released nucleocapsid protein.","['Fu, W', 'Rein, A']","['Fu W', 'Rein A']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology and Carcinogenesis, NCI-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, Maryland 21702.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Denaturation', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Uridine/metabolism', 'Virion/genetics/metabolism']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5443-5449.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5443-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5443-5449.1993.,['N01-CO-74104/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC237946,

A sequence of more than two copies of the 21-bp enhancer is efficiently activated by Tax, but one copy is not activated extensively. Another sequence (TRE-2, positions -163 to -117) adjacent to the 21-bp enhancer in the long terminal repeat of HTLV-1 can enhance a single copy of the 21-bp enhancer activity in trans activation by Tax. This sequence contains motifs related to the Ets- and NF-kappa B-binding sequences, but mutations at these sites indicated that neither is responsive to cooperation with the 21-bp enhancer. A deletion mutation of TRE-2 identified 25 bases at positions -158 to -134 (TRE-2S) as an essential sequence, and TRE-2S was sufficient to give maximum cooperation with one copy of the 21-bp enhancer in trans activation by Tax protein. Using TRE-2S as a probe, we screened a cDNA library of HUT102 cells by the Southwestern (DNA-protein) procedure and isolated two cDNA clones, THP-1 and -2. These two clones encode TRE-2S-binding proteins, and they differ by only an extra 17 amino acids in THP-2. Both THP proteins contain five zinc finger motifs which are strikingly similar to those of the GLI family, an amplified gene product in glyoma cells. The binding site of THP-1 and -2 was GAACCACCCA in TRE-2S, which is highly homologous to the GLI-binding site. These results suggest that binding of THP to TRE-2S may be involved in cooperation with one copy of the 21-bp enhancer in responding to Tax trans activation.","['Tanimura, A', 'Teshima, H', 'Fujisawa, J', 'Yoshida, M']","['Tanimura A', 'Teshima H', 'Fujisawa J', 'Yoshida M']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (GLI2 protein, human)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli2)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Viral Proteins', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli2', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5375-5382.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5375-82. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5375-5382.1993.,,,,"['GENBANK/D14827', 'GENBANK/D14828']",,,,,PMC237938,

Previously we have shown that Pr65gag is membrane associated and that at least a portion of intracellular Pr65gag protein appears to be routed to the plasma membrane by a vesicular transport pathway. Here we show that intracellular particle formation can occur in M-MuLV-infected cells. M-MuLV immature particles were observed by electron microscopy budding into and within rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and vacuolar compartments. Biochemical fractionation studies indicated that intracellular Pr65gag was present in nonionic detergent-resistant complexes of greater than 150S. Additionally, viral RNA and polymerase functions appeared to be associated with intracellular particles, as were Gag-beta-galactosidase fusion proteins which have the capacity to be incorporated into virions. Immature intracellular particles in postnuclear lysates could be proteolytically processed in vitro to mature forms, while extracellular immature M-MuLV particles remained immature as long as 10 h during incubations. The occurrence of M-MuLV-derived intracellular particles demonstrates that Pr65gag can associate with intracellular membranes and indicates that if a plasma membrane Pr65gag receptor exists, it also can be found in other membrane compartments. These results support the hypothesis that intracellular particles may serve as a virus reservoir during in vivo infections.","['Hansen, M', 'Jelinek, L', 'Jones, R S', 'Stegeman-Olsen, J', 'Barklis, E']","['Hansen M', 'Jelinek L', 'Jones RS', 'Stegeman-Olsen J', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute for Advanced Biomedical Research, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/microbiology/ultrastructure', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Products, gag/analysis', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'RNA, Antisense', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Ribonucleases', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism/ultrastructure']",1993/09/01 00:00,1993/09/01 00:01,['1993/09/01 00:00'],"['1993/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.67.9.5163-5174.1993 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1993 Sep;67(9):5163-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.67.9.5163-5174.1993.,['2 R01CA47088-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,PMC237914,

After biochemical improvement, the patients recovered immune function in a pattern similar to that observed in normal thymic ontogeny and in patients with immunological reconstitution after bone marrow transplantation. Immune reconstitution was marked by the sequential appearance in the peripheral blood of phenotypic T lymphocytes corresponding to successive stages of thymic differentiation. Functional reconstitution was marked by the successive appearance of mitogen responses dependent on exogenous in vitro IL-2, mitogen responses not requiring exogenous IL-2, antigen-specific responses dependent on exogenous IL-2, and finally, antigen-specific responses not requiring exogenous IL-2.

First, the sensitivity of the PCR targeting a 286-bp alpha-tubulin sequence was studied in tissue sections fixed in several fixatives for various periods at 25 or 4 degrees C. For histological examination, fixation with 10% buffered formalin at a lower temperature for a shorter period was found to be preferable to retain the sensitivity. And the HTLV-I sequence was detected in only 7 of 18 specimens (38.9%) when the 374-bp sequence of the gag region was targeted, but the rate increased to 77.8% (14 of 18 specimens) when the length of the target sequence was reduced to 120 bp within the same region.

Most TfR is transported to endosomes and returns rapidly to the cell surface. In addition, approximately 10% of the internalized receptor recycles through the Golgi complex. To examine the role of microtubules in TfR traffic, K562 cultured human leukemia cells treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules were studied. Nocodazole caused a 50% increase in the level of surface TfR, which was due to a change in receptor dynamics. The endocytosis rate in treated cells was 20% of control, indicating that TfR endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles was slowed, whereas the recycling of internalized receptors to the cell surface was unaffected. In contrast, nocodazole had little effect on the transport of TfR from the cell surface to the Golgi complex. Thus, the fragmentation and dispersal of the Golgi complex caused by microtubule depolymerization, which does not interrupt secretory traffic through this organelle, also does not block recycling through the Golgi. The decreased TfR endocytosis via coated vesicles and the increased TfR transport to the Golgi caused by nocodazole suggest that either (i) endocytosis via coated vesicles is not the rate-limiting step in transport to the Golgi or (ii) coated vesicles are not a part of this pathway. Finally, because nocodazole inhibits traffic from endosomes to lysosomes, surface-to-Golgi transport probably does not involve a lysosomal intermediate.","['Jin, M', 'Snider, M D']","['Jin M', 'Snider MD']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-4935.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Sialic Acids)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'SH1WY3R615 (Nocodazole)']",IM,"['Exocytosis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Golgi Apparatus/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lysosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Nocodazole/pharmacology', 'Organelles/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/biosynthesis/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Sialic Acids/metabolism', 'Transferrin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/25 00:00,1993/08/25 00:01,['1993/08/25 00:00'],"['1993/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46856-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 25;268(24):18390-7.,['GM38183/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Construction and analysis of chimeric N-formyl peptide receptors.,18167-75,"Binding of the chemotactic tripeptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMLP) to its receptor on phagocytes activates these cells through a G protein-coupled pathway. To delineate the structural requirement of the N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) for ligand binding and signaling, we constructed chimeric receptors between FPR and a recently identified granulocyte receptor, FPR2 (Ye, R. D., Cavanagh, S. L., Quehenberger, O., Prossnitz, E. R., and Cochrane, C. G. (1992) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 184, 582-589). FPR2 shares 69% sequence homology with the FPR; yet it binds fMLP with a low affinity (Kd = 430 nM), as compared with the high affinity (Kd = 1 nM) displayed by the FPR. This property of the FPR2 was utilized for mapping the FPR ligand binding domains. Seven chimeric FPR/FPR2 receptors were generated by sequential replacement of the FPR segments with the corresponding regions from FPR2. Three reciprocal FPR2/FPR chimeric receptors were also constructed by selective substitution of the FPR segments into FPR2. These chimeric receptors were stably expressed in transfected fibroblasts and analyzed for their ligand binding and transmembrane signaling properties. Replacement of the FPR domains, including the first and the third extracellular loops, resulted in 275- and 85-fold decrease in ligand binding affinity, respectively. Introduction of both domains into the FPR2 significantly increased ligand binding affinity (Kd = 18 nM), whereas substitution of the domains containing the first or third extracellular loop alone improved ligand binding to a lesser degree (Kd = 90 and 372 nM, respectively). In contrast, substitution of either the amino or the carboxyl-terminal regions with those of the FPR2 had little effect on ligand binding affinity. An analysis of the sequences of the two receptors revealed several key residues in the first and the third extracellular loops of the FPR and their adjacent transmembrane domains that may be essential for binding of fMLP. We propose that multiple domains of the FPR are required for high-affinity ligand binding, with a major determinant located in the first extracellular loop and its adjacent transmembrane domains.","['Quehenberger, O', 'Prossnitz, E R', 'Cavanagh, S L', 'Cochrane, C G', 'Ye, R D']","['Quehenberger O', 'Prossnitz ER', 'Cavanagh SL', 'Cochrane CG', 'Ye RD']","['Department of Immunology, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Models, Structural', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Radioligand Assay', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/25 00:00,1993/08/25 00:01,['1993/08/25 00:00'],"['1993/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46825-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 25;268(24):18167-75.,"['AI33503/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM46572/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The beta-subunit phosphorylation was transient and was found to be specific for GTP and its analog, guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate. When phosphorylated membranes were incubated with various nucleotides, the bound phosphate was specifically removed by GDP, suggesting that the phosphate can be retransferred onto GDP. Divalent cations, preferentially Mg2+ and Mn2+, were required for both phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The phosphorylation was stable against treatment with NaOH but sensitive to treatment with heat, HCl, and hydroxylamine. Moreover, treatment of the membranes with the histidine-modifying agent, diethyl pyrocarbonate, resulted in a loss in phosphate incorporation. The data suggest that G protein beta-subunits are involved in a guanine nucleotide-specific enzymatic activity transferring the gamma-phosphate from GTP to GDP, presumably at G protein alpha-subunits, via a phosphohistidine intermediate.","['Wieland, T', 'Nurnberg, B', 'Ulibarri, I', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch, S', 'Schultz, G', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Nurnberg B', 'Ulibarri I', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch S', 'Schultz G', 'Jakobs KH']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitat GH Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', '2FP81O2L9Z (Hydroxylamine)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'LMR3LZG146 (Diethyl Pyrocarbonate)', 'UKY8AGM174 (phosphohistidine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Membrane', 'Diethyl Pyrocarbonate/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Guanine Nucleotides/*metabolism/pharmacology', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*metabolism"", 'Guanosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Histidine/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxylamine', 'Hydroxylamines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/08/25 00:00,1993/08/25 00:01,['1993/08/25 00:00'],"['1993/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46818-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 25;268(24):18111-8.,,,,,,,,,,

Activation was observed after 2 h of treatment, was maximal by 8 h, and could be blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Coexpression of v-Ha-Ras-, v-Raf-, and v-Src-activated beta E2 x 4, and constitutively active mutants of protein kinase C also increased transcription from this construct. Calcium ionophore generated signals which synergized with both Ras and protein kinase C. Expression of a truncated Raf protein which has been shown to act in a dominant negative manner, was able to inhibit activation of beta E2 x 4, demonstrating that Raf plays an important role in T cell signaling. A dominant negative mutant of v-Ha-Ras inhibited all methods of activation tested, including transfection with v-Raf.

Dissociation of growth inhibitory effects of TNF-alpha from activation of nuclear factor-kappa B.,17762-6,"Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) exerts pleiotropic biologic effects. Although TNF-alpha appears to activate a number of signal transduction pathways, the role of second messengers in mediating the different effects of TNF-alpha are not well defined. In this study, we investigated the role of ceramide as an intracellular mediator of TNF-alpha action. In Jurkat T cells, TNF-alpha caused early activation of the sphingomyelin cycle with peak hydrolysis of sphingomyelin observed at 30 min following addition of TNF-alpha. In this cell line, TNF-alpha caused potent activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and exerted potent cytostatic/cytocidal activity. C2-ceramide mimicked the effects of TNF-alpha on cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, but C2-ceramide was unable to induce activation of NF-kappa B under multiple conditions investigated. C2-ceramide, however, enhanced activation of NF-kappa B in response to TNF-alpha with peak effects observed at a concentration of C2-ceramide of 5 microM. Thus, ceramide functions as a selective mediator of the cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of TNF-alpha and plays a positive feedback role in activation of NF-kappa B. TNF-alpha signaling, therefore, involves multiple second-messenger pathways that function independently or coordinately to transduce distinct functions of TNF-alpha.","['Dbaibo, G S', 'Obeid, L M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Dbaibo GS', 'Obeid LM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Ceramides/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/genetics', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1993/08/25 00:00,1993/08/25 00:01,['1993/08/25 00:00'],"['1993/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1993/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(17)46770-6 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1993 Aug 25;268(24):17762-6.,['GM-43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Crotoxin cytocidal effect on cell growth had an EC50 of approximately 0.1-0.2 microM (3.0-5.0 micrograms/ml) in serum-free medium. Cytotoxicity was independent of cell growth since both quiescent and proliferating cells had similar sensitivities to the toxin. Dissociation of the crotoxin complex and phospholipase A2 activity of its subunit B are required for cytotoxicity, since the covalently linked crotoxin complex or the specific alkylation of the active site on the subunit B abolish the cytotoxic activity on murine erythroleukemia cells. Specific interaction between crotoxin and murine erythroleukemia cells appears to be required since the homologous phospholipase A2 from Crotalus atrox venom, with a higher phospholipase A2 specific activity than crotoxin, was 86-fold less potent than crotoxin. The data in this report show that the cytotoxic effect of crotoxin on murine erythroleukemia cells is consistent with the specific binding of the toxin resulting in cytocidal action mediated by the phospholipase A2 activity of crotoxin subunit B.","['Corin, R E', 'Viskatis, L J', 'Vidal, J C', 'Etcheverry, M A']","['Corin RE', 'Viskatis LJ', 'Vidal JC', 'Etcheverry MA']","['Department of Biology, City University of New York, College of Staten Island, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-40-3 (Crotoxin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Crotoxin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/02/01 00:00,1993/02/01 00:01,['1993/02/01 00:00'],"['1993/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00873905 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1993 Feb;11(1):11-5. doi: 10.1007/BF00873905.,,,,,,,,,,

The most effective cytokines were interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha) and IL-1 beta; less effective were interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IFN-beta and TNF-beta. The combinations of two cytokines had synergistic or additive effects and increased IL-2 production to a greater extent than either cytokine alone. Other cytokines tested, such as IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8 and IFN-gamma, had no effect on IL-2 production. However, a remarkable heterogeneity in sensitivity to the enhancing effects of the active cytokines was found among the IL-2-producing T cell lines studied. While IL-2 production in the most sensitive cell line, MOLT-16, was increased by all 6 active cytokines, other cell lines responded by increasing IL-2 production to stimulation with only some of the cytokines tested. The production of IL-2 in T cell line H9 was not enhanced by any of the cytokines used. These results show that several cytokines can increase IL-2 production by having a direct effect on the activated IL-2-producing T cells, but also that the outcome of the regulatory effects of individual cytokines depends considerably upon the individual IL-2-producing T cell clone.","['Holan, V', 'Minowada, J']","['Holan V', 'Minowada J']","['Fujisaki Cell Center, Hayashibara Biochemical Laboratories, Inc., Okayama.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1993/01/01 00:00,1993/01/01 00:01,['1993/01/01 00:00'],"['1993/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1993;39(1):1-13.,,,,,,,,,,

In a previous study, we confirmed that a profound deficiency of neutrophil chemotaxis is induced by interleukin-2 therapy. Migration in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP), being normal before therapy, was markedly impaired after the first cycle and further decreased after the third cycle of treatment. A direct effect of interleukin-2 on neutrophil chemotaxis is controversial. However, peripheral blood cells exposed to interleukin-2 secrete secondary cytokines. In particular, the release of tumor necrosis factor after interleukin-2 injection has been proposed as an important regulatory mechanisms. When testing random migration and chemotaxis of neutrophils from normal subjects after incubation with the serum from treated patients, we found that this serum induced a defective chemotaxis similar to that of neutrophils from interleukin-2-treated patients. In order to assess the influence of tumor necrosis factor, we tested the effect of anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibody on the chemotactic response of cells after incubation with the serum, and we observed a dose-dependent reduction of neutrophil chemotaxis deficiency. These data suggest that TNF is counteracting the neutrophil chemotactic deficiency observed during IL-2 treatment.","['Fossat, C', 'Sainty, D', 'Stoppa, A M', 'Blaise, D', 'David, M', 'Maraninchi, D', 'Juhan-Vague, I']","['Fossat C', 'Sainty D', 'Stoppa AM', 'Blaise D', 'David M', 'Maraninchi D', 'Juhan-Vague I']","['Laboratory of Haematology, CHU Timone, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/therapy', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/blood/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/blood/*therapy', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma/blood/therapy', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*physiology']",1993/07/01 00:00,1993/07/01 00:01,['1993/07/01 00:00'],"['1993/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1993/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1993/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00598.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1993 Jul;51(1):13-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1993.tb00598.x.,,,,,,,,,,

The authors performed a dose-escalation trial of ifosfamide with a fixed dosage of etoposide, with mesna uroprotection, in children with multiply recurrent acute leukemia. METHODS: Chemotherapy was administered daily for 5 days. Etoposide 100 mg/m2 was followed by ifosfamide at an initial dosage of 1.6 g/m2. The ifosfamide was escalated in 20% increments to the maximum tolerated dosage in cohorts of three patients. Mesna 400 mg/m2 was given immediately before the ifosfamide and then at 3 and 6 hours after ifosfamide in the initial patients. Subsequent patients were treated with mesna 400 mg/m2 just before ifosfamide, and then every 2 hours to a total dosage equal to the ifosfamide dosage. RESULTS: Forty-four heavily pretreated patients were entered on study. Forty were evaluable for toxicity and 36 for response as well. The maximum tolerated dosage of ifosfamide was 4.0 g/m2/d for 5 days (20 g/m2/course). Overall, 10 patients achieved complete remission, and 3 achieved partial remission. Remissions were brief, although four patients went on to bone marrow transplant while in remission. One patient is still alive.

Since 1950, survival of children has increased remarkably but has changed little for the elderly. The nature and magnitude of this age difference in survival are not understood. METHODS: Median survival was determined in 2364 Kansas residents diagnosed with acute leukemia from 1947 until 1990. Of this number, 1032 had acute lymphocytic leukemia and 1227 had acute myelocytic leukemia diagnosed between 1950 and 1989. These patients were stratified by age and decade of diagnosis. Survival was computed by life-table analysis with significance determined by log-rank, Wilcoxon, and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS: During the 40 years of the study, highly significant increases occurred in median survivals for all groups with either acute lymphocytic leukemia or acute myelocytic leukemia occurring in patients younger than 60 years of age (P < 0.0001 for some age groups), but no significant increases for those 61 to 80 years of age and those 81 years of age and older. Viewed in another dimension, for each decade from the 1960s to the present in acute lymphocytic leukemia and from the 1970s to the present in acute myelocytic leukemia, age at diagnosis was inversely correlated with median survival in a highly significant manner (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age is inversely related to survival in patients with acute leukemia. The lack of significant improvement in median survival in the last 40 years for those older than 60 years of age stands in stark contrast to the remarkable improvement for younger patients.

Liver function tests were impaired and abdominal computerized tomography (CT) showed multiple lesions in the liver and abnormal structure of the spleen. A laparotomy revealed multiple granulomas containing Fusarium sp. in the liver, and the spleen was heavily infiltrated by the same fungus. The patient failed to respond to the conventional AmB dosage form (Fungizone) even after a total dose of 3.0 g was given, and developed significant renal impairment. AmB was complexed (in a mole ratio of 1:16) with a mixture of the phospholipids dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (mixed in 7:3 mole ratio). The resulting drug complex, AmB-PLC, was then administered (1-4 mg/kg/day, total dose 4.2 g) and subsequently the patient was cured of all symptoms of fusariosis. There were only mild side effects and no nephrotoxicity was evident. On the contrary, marked improvement of the renal function tests occurred during AmB-PLC treatment. Eight months later, she developed a spinal lesion with dense consistency in L5 and S1, and after receiving another course of AmB-PLC (3.1 g) she recovered completely.
