The enhancement was dependent on the administration timing of the vaccine, dependent on vaccine-bound Con A, and specific for L1210 leukemia, as evidenced by the fact that no enhancement was induced in P388 leukemic animals. However, the enhancement was dependent on delayed MMC administration, and MMC administered on Day 3 failed to induce the enhancement, indicating that the chemotherapeutic potency of MMC played no major role in the enhancement. These results suggest that the enhancement may be dependent on antileukemia immunity induced by Con A-bound vaccine and may be further potentiated by MMC. A series of experiments comparing immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic responses inducible by different chemotherapeutic agents combined with the vaccine suggested that chemotherapeutic agents enhanced the potency of the vaccine by abrogating suppressors associated with vaccine-bound Con A. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that tumor vaccine induced peritoneal cells of tumor-bearing animals were abrogated in their suppressor activity in polyclonal in vitro spleen cell blastogenesis when these animals were further treated with MMC.","['Kataoka, T', 'Ogihara, K', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Kataoka T', 'Ogihara K', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '0 (Vaccines)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Concanavalin A/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Immunization', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitomycins/*administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory', 'Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology']",1980/10/01 00:00,1980/10/01 00:01,['1980/10/01 00:00'],"['1980/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1980 Oct;40(10):3839-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of a nonsuppressive dose of tumor cells, generation of cytotoxic T cells in the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) is completely suppressed by adding exogenous (peritoneal) macrophages (PM phi) after the initiation of the MLC. This indicates that tumor cells can switch on a suppressor mechanism through host macrophages. It has further been determined that suppression can be induced only if resident (splenic) macrophages (SM phi) are exposed to tumor cells prior to addition of PM phi. If SM phi and PM phi are simultaneously present with the tumor cells, induction of suppression is completely precluded. These findings indicate that switching on of the suppressor mechanism by tumor cells has a critical requirement for the collaboration of two populations of macrophages, SM phi and PM phi, and their presence in a specific sequence (SM phi preceding PM phi).

Four classes of cloned M-MuLV inserts were found: Class I, full length 8.8-kilobase (kb) inserts with two tandem long terminal repeats (LTRs) of 600 base pairs; class 2, 8.2-kb inserts with a single copy of a LTR; class 3, M-MuLV DNA inserts with various portions deleted; and class 4, an 8.8-kb insert with an internal sequence inversion. Determination of nucleotide sequence at the junction between the two LTRs from a class 1 insert suggested that circularization occurred by blunt-end ligation of an 8.8-kb linear DNA. The class 4 molecule had an inversion that was flanked by inverted LTRs, each of which had lost two terminal base pairs at the inversion end points. Also, four base pairs that were present only once in standard M-MuLV DNA were duplicated at either end of the inversion. This molecule was interpreted as resulting from an integrative inversion in which M-MuLV DNA has integrated into itself. Its analysis thus provided explicit information concerning the mechanism by which retrovirus DNA integrates into host cell DNA. Models of retrovirus integration based on bacterial DNA transposition mechanisms are proposed.","['Shoemaker, C', 'Goff, S', 'Gilboa, E', 'Paskind, M', 'Mitra, S W', 'Baltimore, D']","['Shoemaker C', 'Goff S', 'Gilboa E', 'Paskind M', 'Mitra SW', 'Baltimore D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Circular)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Bacteriophage lambda/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Circular/genetics', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Escherichia coli/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic']",1980/07/01 00:00,1980/07/01 00:01,['1980/07/01 00:00'],"['1980/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1980 Jul;77(7):3932-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.77.7.3932.,['10.1073/pnas.77.7.3932 [doi]'],"['CA-14051/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-26717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-53562/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC349741,,,,,,,,,,

On this basis, we hybridized thymus cells from mice bearing sarcoma MCA-1490 with cells from the T lymphoma BW5147. The hybrids (hybridomas) formed were tested for production of factors that could suppress T lymphocyte-mediated lysis of MCA-1490 cells. One hybridoma, and a clone derived from it, produced factors that suppressed the lysis of MCA-1490 cells in vitro. In addition, these factors enhanced the growth of MCA-1490 in immune mice and prevented the destruction of MCA-1490 cells by immune lymphocytes in tumor neutralization (Winn) assays. In vitro lysis of cells from another MCA-induced sarcoma by immune lymphocytes was not suppressed. The suppressor factors did not affect the proliferative response of BALB/c lymphocytes to mitogens or the generation of a cytotoxic response to C57BL/6 alloantigens. Neither did they inhibit the generation of primary or secondary cytotoxic responses to murine leukemia virus-related antigens present on a BALB/c lymphoma line, LSTRA.

While the normal sibling did not respond in MLC to her HLA-identical sister's remission lymphocytes, there was an anti-blast response. This proliferative response, however, did not lead to the development of detectable cytotoxic cells capable of destroying blast cells.

The kinetics and magnitude of the MLC response to blast cells was different from that to remission lymphocytes.

However, like 5-fluorouracil and 2'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (FUdR), 5'-DFUR was ineffective on L1210 leukemia resistant to 5-fluorouracil, suggesting that it would exert its antitumor activity through converted 5-fluorouracil. In tissue culture, 5'-DFUR inhibited the growth of various tumor cells similarly to ther fluorinated pyrimidines. However, 5'-DFUR was unique in that uridine completely reversed its inhibitory effect. Enzymological study clarified that uridine inhibited the conversion of 5'-DFUR to 5-fluorouracil by a uridine phosphorylase, in parallel to its reverse effect on cell growth inhibition by 5'-DFUR. Furthermore, a subline of L1210 leukemia resistant to 5'-DFUR but not to 5-fluorouracil was found to lack the uridine phosphorylase. These results indicate that 5'-DFUR is a depot form of 5-fluorouracil which can be promptly activated by uridine phosphorylase. In addition, the uridine phosphorylase was found to be abundant in sarcoma-180 solid tumor, leading to a significantly higher concentration of converted 5-fluorouracil in this tumor than in other normal tissues. This provides a good explanation for the high chemotherapeutic index of 5'-DFUR against this tumor, which may be applicable also for other tumors.","['Ishitsuka, H', 'Miwa, M', 'Takemoto, K', 'Fukuoka, K', 'Itoga, A', 'Maruyama, H B']","['Ishitsuka H', 'Miwa M', 'Takemoto K', 'Fukuoka K', 'Itoga A', 'Maruyama HB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Gan,Gan,0151745,"['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '1548R74NSZ (Tegafur)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.3 (Uridine Phosphorylase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'V1JK16Y2JP (doxifluridine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Floxuridine/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Sarcoma 180/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Tegafur/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine/pharmacology', 'Uridine/pharmacology', 'Uridine Phosphorylase/*metabolism']",1980/02/01 00:00,1980/02/01 00:01,['1980/02/01 00:00'],"['1980/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gan. 1980 Feb;71(1):112-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B and T cells were separated by sheep red blood cell rosette techniques and, by culture of these cells from CLL patients in various combinations with B or T cells from normal subjects, it was possible to measure independently the function of B lymphocytes and the helper or suppressor function of T lymphocytes. By these methods it was found that the B lymphocytes of six of eight patients failed to produce immunoglobulins in vitro. B lymphocytes from two patients appeared to produce immunoglobulins in vitro. T lymphocytes from five of the eight patients had low or undetectable helper T cell function and in six patients their T lymphocytes had excessive suppressor activity in comparison to T lymphocyte populations from normal subjects. Whether the primary abnormality in the CLL T cell populations was a deficiency of helper T cells or excess of suppressor T cells was uncertain from these studies. These results suggest that immunoglobulin production by B lymphocytes from most patients with CLL was abnormal but also that T cells from CLL patients may be abnormal in respect to their role in immunoglobulin production at an early stage of the disease. These findings may assist in understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and lead to new approaches in treatment.","['Hersey, P', 'Wotherspoon, J', 'Reid, G', 'Gunz, F W']","['Hersey P', 'Wotherspoon J', 'Reid G', 'Gunz FW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Agammaglobulinemia/etiology/*immunology', 'Aged', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology']",1980/03/01 00:00,1980/03/01 00:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1980 Mar;39(3):698-707.,,,PMC1538113,,,,,,,,,,

T cell enriched subpopulations were obtained by double passage of mononuclear cells through mylon wool columns. Non-T cell subpopulations were collected by eluting adherent cells from nylon wool columns and by incubating them with sheep erythrocytes followed by density gradient centrifugation. Unfractionated mononuclear cells, T enriched and non-T subpopulations were compared. Enriched T cell subpopulations from HCL and reference patients responded similarly to allogeneic antigens and phytohaemagglutinin. Splenic non-T cells from reference patients produced a stronger stimulus in the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction than did the unfractionated or the T enriched cells. In contrast, the non-T subpopulations from patients with HCL produced a reduced response compared to that of reference splenic cells when mixed with allogeneic lymphocytes. In addition, non-T cells from HCL patients failed to respond to pokeweed mitogen. Neither reference nor HCL splenic cells produced a significant response in the autologous mixed lymphocyte reactions. The data suggest that splenic non-T cells from patients with HCL either suppress the stimulatory capacity of normal B lymphocytes or fail to stimulate allogeneic lymphocytes in the mixed lymphocyte reactions.","['Davey, F R', 'Dock, N L', 'Wolos, J A']","['Davey FR', 'Dock NL', 'Wolos JA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1980/05/01 00:00,1980/05/01 00:01,['1980/05/01 00:00'],"['1980/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1980 May;45(1):29-39. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1980.tb03808.x.,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1980.tb03808.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A two-component receptor system consisting of binding and activation sites has been proposed. This hypothesis is supported by the finding that interferon inhibits binding of cholera toxin and thyrotropin to their receptors suggesting possible common receptor sites. Moreover, an antiserum against cell surface components of interferon-sensitive cells has been shown to inhibit the action of interferon. However, to understand the interaction of interferon with the cell surface requires direct ligand-binding studies. I present here direct evidence that high-affinity binding of interferon to a specific cell surface receptor is an initial step in interferon action using biologically active purified 125I-labelled mouse interferon. Labelled interferon binds specifically to interferon-sensitive mouse leukaemia L1210 cells, whereas binding to interferon-resistant L1210 cells is nonspecific. Furthermore, specific binding to monolayer cultures of mouse L929 cells is compared with nonspecific binding to chick embryo fibroblasts insensitive to the action of mouse interferon.","['Aguet, M']",['Aguet M'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Chick Embryo', 'Interferons/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'L Cells', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Drug/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interferon', 'Species Specificity']",1980/04/03 00:00,1980/04/03 00:01,['1980/04/03 00:00'],"['1980/04/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/03 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1980 Apr 3;284(5755):459-61. doi: 10.1038/284459a0.,['10.1038/284459a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a phenotypically normal 3-day-old boy with hepatosplenomegaly, leukocytosis, and circulating myeloblasts. On chromosome analysis, trisomy 21 was found in all blood and bone marrow cells. However, only 4% of cultured skin fibroblasts were trisomic and the other 96% were normal, thus indicating mosaicism. Without treatment, the leukocyte count gradually returned to normal and the organomegaly diminished. Subsequently, chromosome analysis of blood and bone marrow disclosed a predominance of cells with a normal karyotype. These findings suggest that mosaicism could be responsible for the transient leukemoid reactions in some newborns--i.e., the trisomic cells may temporarily gain a proliferative advantage over the normal cells, perhaps by inhibiting their growth. Serial cytogenetic studies, as well as chromosome analysis of more than one tissue, may help to distinguish transient leukemoid reactions from acute leukemia in infants.","['Brodeur, G M', 'Dahl, G V', 'Williams, D L', 'Tipton, R E', 'Kalwinsky, D K']","['Brodeur GM', 'Dahl GV', 'Williams DL', 'Tipton RE', 'Kalwinsky DK']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Hepatomegaly/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', '*Infant, Newborn, Diseases', 'Leukemia/diagnosis', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*complications/diagnosis', 'Leukocytosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Mosaicism', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Phenotype', 'Skin/cytology', 'Splenomegaly/etiology']",1980/04/01 00:00,1980/04/01 00:01,['1980/04/01 00:00'],"['1980/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1980/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1980/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1980 Apr;55(4):691-3.,['S0006-4971(20)66467-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients received surgery with curative intent; 470 also received TSPA, 176 received FdUrd, and 867 received surgery only. The unique VA system permitted complete follow-up through 1977, with 10,902 person-years of observation accrued among 1,613 male patients (mean survival = 6.8 yr). Expected mortality and cancer incidence were computed by applying U.S. Mortality Statistics and Connecticut Tumor Registry age-, race-, sex-, and calendar time-specific rates to the person-years of observation. The mortality experience of the 3 groups was similar. Overall, there was a significant excess in total mortality (observed/expected = 1,359/553) attributable mainly to colorectal cancer (584/14), arteriosclerotic heart disease (258/215.9), pneumonia (41/17), gastric and duodenal ulcers (15/4), and cirrhosis (14/6). No excess mortality from noncolorectal cancers was apparent, nor were there significant differences by treatment: TSPA (22/22), FdUrd (9/12), and surgery only (50/42). Among 1,402 white patients, no significant excess of incident noncolorectal cancers were observed among patients treated with TSPA (30/31, FdUrd (14/15), or surgery only (63/58). Seven incident cases of leukemia developed (4.1 expected) among all patients of various groups: TSPA (3/1.3), FdUrd (1/0.6), and surgery only (3/2.2). No excess of new primary cancers was observed among 211 nonwhite patients. An inverse relationship between the occurrence of second primary cancer and age at diagnosis, irrespective of therapy, was suggested. The results demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for assessment of late complications of anticancer therapy and suggested no measurable carcinogenic effect following very low doses of TSPA and FdUrd in a population of this size.","['Boice, J D', 'Greene, M H', 'Keehn, R J', 'Higgins, G A', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Boice JD', 'Greene MH', 'Keehn RJ', 'Higgins GA', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colonic Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Floxuridine/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Rectal Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Thiotepa/*adverse effects']",1980/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1980/03/01 00:00'],"['1980/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1980/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1980 Mar;64(3):501-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of inhibitors of DNA repair (Caff and 3AMB) or DNA synthesis (HU) on the frequencies of such aberrations has been estimated. No randomly located DNA breaks could be detected under neutral conditions, but BrdUrd-substituted DNA was found to contain numerous alkali labile sites. At high concentrations, CldUrd causes G2 delay, similar to the action of known DNA-damaging agents. The extent of delay depends on the pattern of incorporation of the analog, i.e., incorporation for 2 cell cycles causes the longest delay, growth for 12 hr in CldUrd followed by 12 hr in dThd- containing medium gives less delay, and delay is not significant when the cells are incubated in the analog for only 12 hr prior to fixation. Numerous chromatid-type aberrations are present in cells incubated at the highest CldUrd concentration and their induction follows the pattern of induction of G2 delay, indicating the involvement of a common lesion. 3AMB, and HU increase the number of CAs when added 2 hr before fixation. The significance of these results is discussed.","['Zwanenburg, T S', 'Mullenders, L H', 'Natarajan, A T', 'van Zeeland, A A']","['Zwanenburg TS', 'Mullenders LH', 'Natarajan AT', 'van Zeeland AA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Basic Life Sci,Basic life sciences,0360077,"[""50-90-8 (5-chloro-2'-deoxyuridine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Interphase/*drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Ovary', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Skin']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Basic Life Sci. 1984;29 Pt A:69-82. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-4889-4_5.,['10.1007/978-1-4684-4889-4_5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Glucose and insulin values were assessed before and after L-asparaginase (L-asp). 30 children (group A) received L-asp as a single-agent consolidation course, after achieving remission with vincristine (VCR) and prednisone (PDN). Normal insulin and glucose levels were found in all patients before L-asp; 4 children (13%) had a transient impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) after completing L-asp therapy. 17 children (group B) were given L-asp during induction therapy with VCR and PDN, and all achieved complete remission. 5 patients (23%) had IGT, without hypoinsulinemia, before L-asp administration. IGT normalized in 4 patients after L-asp, the other children developed a diabetes mellitus. Only 1 patient, with a normal IGT test before L-asp therapy, showed a transient IGT after L-asp. In patients with ALL, the presence of IGT before treatment may be related to leukemia. The concomitant use of steroids does not influence the incidence of IGT in our series. Our data reveal normal insulinemia in patients with IGT.

Although the data do not provide conclusive evidence for a role of IL 3 in T cell differentiation, a number of observations provide some indications that a relationship exists. The most intriguing aspects are concerned with the distribution and regulation of expression of 20 alpha SDH. This particular marker is interesting since it may allow studies of aspects of T cell differentiation that have not been possible with more conventional approaches. The available data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the bone marrow there exists a stem cell that in response to IL 3 is induced to differentiate including the induction of expression of 20 alpha SDH and Thy 1+. Phenotypically this induced cell is similar to a medullary thymocyte, although the cells derived in vitro clearly do not have the functional characteristics of medullary thymocytes. It can be rationalized that a bone marrow-induced prothymocyte may require the thymic microenvironment for continued maturation. Irrespective of this, it now becomes necessary to further explore the possibilities by extending the approaches used to define and study early bone marrow-localized pre-T cell populations as well as continuing to define the necessary components of the thymus in the differentiation pathway for T cells. In these areas of research the experience and systems derived from studies of long-term bone marrow cultures will be of considerable value. In addition to the proposed role that IL 3 plays in early T cell differentiation, it is apparent that the stem cell that is induced to differentiate may have considerably more potentials than the T cell lineage. The ability of IL 3 to induce the differentiation of 20 alpha SDH-positive mastlike cells in vitro is the most demonstrable functional phenotype. The absolute requirement of Il 3 throughout the differentiation of such cells indicates that in vivo, where IL 3 is generally not detectable, the frequency with which such progeny are obtained may be quite low and restricted to unique immunological situations in which high levels of IL 3 are produced. In addition, it appears likely that IL 3 induces the differentiation of a cell that in the presence of erythropoietin can be induced to differentiate along an erythroid pathway. Last, IL 3 may induce the differentiation of promyeloblasts that can differentiate in the presence of CSF-2 [unpublished data].(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ihle, J N', 'Keller, J']","['Ihle JN', 'Keller J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Kroc Found Ser,Kroc Foundation series,7611160,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 1.1.1.149 (20-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['20-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/analysis', '20-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Communication', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*cytology/drug effects']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Kroc Found Ser. 1984;18:399-421.,,,,89,,,,,,,,,

However, information is lacking on the levels of selenium-dependent glutathione peroxidase (Se-GSH-Px), non-Se-GSH-Px and glutathione S-transferases (GSH-S-Trs), key enzymes involved in fatty acid hydroperoxide metabolism and leukotriene biosynthesis in these cells. Both GSH-S-Trs and non-Se-GSH-Px reactions are catalyzed by the same enzyme. In the present studies, we have measured the enzyme activities of GSH-Px(s) and GSH-S-Trs in the 105,000 X g supernatant fraction of sonified RBL-1 cells. The specific activities for GSH-Px(s) toward H2O2, cumene hydroperoxide, and 15S-hydroperoxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15S-HPETE) are 12.6, 17.9 and 26.9 nmoles X min-1 X mg-1 protein, respectively. A specific activity of 18.9 nmoles X min-1 X mg-1 protein with 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene was estimated for the GSH-S-Trs.

The use of anti-receptor monoclonal antibodies to isolate and characterize the receptor from human and murine T-cell clones has shown that the protein consists of two disulphide-linked glycopeptides, alpha and beta, distinct from known immunoglobulin light and heavy chains. Like immunoglobulin light and heavy chains, however, both the alpha- and beta-chains are composed of variable and constant regions. Molecular cloning has revealed that the beta-chain is evolutionarily related to immunoglobulins, and is encoded in separate V (variable), D (diversity), J (joining) and C (constant) segments that are rearranged in T cells to produce a functional gene. We report here cDNA clones encoding the alpha-chain of the receptor of the human T-cell leukaemia line HPB-MLT. Using these cDNA probes, we find that expression of alpha-chain mRNA and rearrangement of an alpha-chain V-gene segment occur only in T cells.

In addition we studied four patients with T chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (T-CLL); four patients with acute leukaemia (3 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL), and 1 mixed acute leukaemia (M.AL)); and six patients with chronic granulocytic leukaemias in blastic crisis (CGL.BC).

The light chain genes were analysed by using probes for the constant region of the kappa (C kappa) and lambda (C lambda) chains. We have found rearranged Ig genes in all cases of B-CLL, B-PLL and HCL, but in none of the patients with T-CLL. In one case of HCL, both mu genes were deleted, indicating that in this case the class switch has taken place. In four out of six cases with either ALL or lymphoid CGL.BC and in one case of M.AL, an Ig gene rearrangement was also found. No rearrangement was detected in two cases of myeloid CGL.BC. When the combination of rearrangement versus germ-line configuration was considered, a variety of patterns emerge, but in no case did we find a L chain gene rearranged without at least one H chain gene being rearranged as well. Whereas in the majority of cases of B-CLL only one H chain gene is rearranged, in nearly all cases of B-PLL both H chain genes are rearranged. By systematic analysis of restriction fragment sizes of rearranged genes, we have established that a large number of different variable regions for the H chain (VH) are involved in Ig gene rearrangement in B-cell malignancies.

This methodology, called Grade of Membership analysis, has several properties that are particularly important in such assessments. First, simultaneously with the determination of the multivariate profile of characteristics that describe a group, the methodology determines the degree to which each case is described by that profile, which means that the model can explicitly represent the heterogeneity of individual cases in any derived classification scheme. Second, the estimates of the model's parameters are produced by maximum likelihood procedures; hence, the classification and group descriptions generated by the model can be statistically evaluated. Third, because of the way the group profiles are constructed, the results of the analysis will be reasonably robust to the selection of new samples.

The T-PLL cells, identified as typical PLL cells by nuclear morphology, were typed as E+slg-OKT1+3-4+6-8-11+ cells lacking reactivity with OKI-1 or OKM-1. In addition, between 3% and 10% of the cells reacted with monoclonal antibodies against T10. In contrast to normal T cells, the T-PLL cells could not be induced to proliferate by mitogenic lectins or alloantigens in the presence or absence of human interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2(IL-2) or allogeneic monocytes and did not produce IL-2. They also failed to proliferate in response to TPA or TPA in the presence of phytohemagglutinin (PHA), but under these conditions T-PLL cells secreted high levels of IL-2 activity. Incubation in the presence of PHA + TPA or TPA for 48 h induced T-PLL cells to become blasts exhibiting enhanced protein synthesis, and induced a 10-fold increase in the percentage of cells reactive with monoclonal antibodies against T10. At the same time, about 15% of the cells developed receptors for IL-2 as monitored by their reactivity with anti-Tac monoclonal antibody. Washing of these T-PLL cells to remove TPA resulted in the induction of proliferation upon subsequent culture in the presence of IL-2 or in medium only. Since proliferating T-PLL cells still failed to express T3 antigens, it was concluded that these leukemic cells represent a T-cell differentiation stage or a T-cell subset which can be activated via a T3-independent pathway.","['Vyth-Dreese, F A', 'De Vries, J E']","['Vyth-Dreese FA', 'De Vries JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbols/*toxicity', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*toxicity']",1984/12/15 00:00,1984/12/15 00:01,['1984/12/15 00:00'],"['1984/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1984 Dec 15;34(6):831-8. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910340614.,['10.1002/ijc.2910340614 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The K+ ionophore valinomycin (1 microM) produced homogeneous changes in the fluorescence of the entire population, the magnitude of which was dependent upon the concentration of extracellular K+. These changes allowed the estimation of the potassium equilibrium potential of the cells, by the null-point method, to be -11.9 mV. The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (500 nM) produced heterogeneous changes in fluorescence, with populations of both hyperpolarised and depolarised cells. In addition, the depolarised population underwent an apparent size change, with a reduction in cell volume. This heterogeneity of response resulted in a minimal change in the median fluorescence value for the whole population, which suggests that it would not have been detectable by methods dependent upon net population-averaged changes in fluorescence. Removal of extracellular Na+ or preincubation of cells with amiloride (500 microM) effectively eliminated the depolarised population. Removal of extracellular K+ increased the hyperpolarised population. These findings provide evidence for the presence of Ca2+-induced Na+ exchange and Ca2+-induced K+ efflux mechanisms in these cells which may be expressed simultaneously in the cell population.","['Hickman, J A', 'Blair, O C', 'Stepanowski, A L', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Hickman JA', 'Blair OC', 'Stepanowski AL', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['2001-95-8 (Valinomycin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Valinomycin/pharmacology']",1984/12/19 00:00,1984/12/19 00:01,['1984/12/19 00:00'],"['1984/12/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/19 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1984 Dec 19;778(3):457-62. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(84)90394-8.,"['0005-2736(84)90394-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(84)90394-8 [doi]']",['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

We have tried to evaluate the cost-benefit ratio of radiological detection at the age of 3-4 months, taking into account the socio-economic cost and radiation risk. Assuming a frequency of this disorder of 1% the average cost of treatment of one case detected by X-ray screening at the age of 3-4 months, including the price of X-ray examinations of 99 normal babies, is 23,374 FF. The average cost of treatment of a case detected when walking (i.e. after 9 months) is 84,230 FF. The cost-benefit ratio is 3.6. In countries where the frequency reaches 2% the cost benefit ratio is 4.57. It also appears from our study that the irradiation of the patient is much smaller when the diagnosis is made earlier. Comparing the slight irradiation delivered to normal infants by this mass screening to the heavy irradiation received by a few individuals whose treatment is started after 9 months, the calculated risk of leukemia or of genetic disorder for the whole population still favours a systematic X-ray film of the pelvis at age 3-4 months. However, if it were decided to make obligatory this mass radiological detection programme during the fourth month of life, this would necessitate a serious effort to train all radiologists to obtain adequate films with the best radiation protection.","['Faure, C', 'Schmit, P', 'Salvat, D']","['Faure C', 'Schmit P', 'Salvat D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,,IM,"['Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Hip Dislocation, Congenital/*diagnostic imaging/economics/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mass Screening/economics', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiography', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 1984;14(6):407-12. doi: 10.1007/BF02343430.,['10.1007/BF02343430 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As shown by an antibody-binding radioimmunoassay and analysis by flow microfluorometry of cells labelled by indirect immunofluorescence, the LAU-A1 antibody reacted with all six T-cell lines but not with any of the B-cell lines or myeloid cell lines tested from a panel of 17 human hematopoietic cell lines. The LAU-A1 antibody was also shown to react with the majority of thymocytes and E-rosette-enriched peripheral blood lymphocytes. Among the malignant cell populations tested, the blasts from all 20 patients with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were found to react with the LAU-A1 antibody, whereas blasts from 85 patients with common ALL and 63 patients with acute myeloid leukemias were entirely negative. Examination of frozen tissue sections from fetal and adult thymuses stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method revealed that cells expressing the LAU-A1 antigen were localized in both the cortex and the medulla. From the very broad reactivity spectrum of LAU-A1 antibody, we conclude that this antibody is directed against a T-cell antigen expressed throughout the T-cell differentiation lineage. SDS-PAGE analysis of immunoprecipitates formed by LAU-A1 antibody with detergent lysates of radiolabeled T-cells showed that the LAU-A1 antigen had an apparent mol. wt of 76,000 under non-reducing conditions. Under reducing conditions a single band with an apparent mol. wt of 40,000 was observed. Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the 76,000 mol. wt component consisted of an S-S-linked dimeric complex. The surface membrane expression of LAU-A1 antigen on HSB-2 T-cells was modulated when these cells were cultured in the presence of LAU-A1 antibody. Re-expression of LAU-A1 antigen occurred within 24 hr after transfer of the modulated cells into antibody-free medium.","['Carrel, S', 'Gross, N', 'Heumann, D', 'Sekaly, R P', 'Girardet, C', 'Schmidt-Kessen, A', 'Mach, J P']","['Carrel S', 'Gross N', 'Heumann D', 'Sekaly RP', 'Girardet C', 'Schmidt-Kessen A', 'Mach JP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1984 Oct;21(10):831-40. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(84)90136-6.,['10.1016/0161-5890(84)90136-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

A third monoclonal antibody, C56 (developed in our laboratory), was found to have similar properties to those of OKT6. On SDS-PAGE, all three antibodies precipitated a 48,000-12,000-dalton heterodimer. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and chymotryptic peptide map analysis revealed that these antibodies precipitated in identical 48,000-dalton heavy chain which was distinguishable from the HLA-A,B,C heavy chains. The single 12,000-dalton light chain precipitated with OKT6 antibody was shown to be distinct from beta 2-microglobulin by its pI. The two light chains precipitated with Leu-6 antibody were resolved by charge into beta 2-microglobulin and the more basic 12,000-dalton peptide identical to that precipitated with OKT6. In addition to beta 2-microglobulin, the latter component (presumably beta t) was also found in the light-chain fraction precipitated from the thymocytes with a monoclonal antibody recognizing the framework of HLA-A,B,C heavy chains. Using chymotryptic peptide mapping, no polymorphism was detected among the heavy chains of the T6 antigen isolated from thymocytes of four individuals. All three monoclonal antibodies failed to precipitate murine TL from ASL1 leukemia cell lysates. Similarly, none of the six monoclonal and two conventional anti-TL antibodies reacted with T6. Although a high degree of homology was found by peptide map analysis among the TL molecules encoded by the Tlaa, Tlad and Tlae alleles, a comparison between their peptide maps and that of T6 revealed no similarity.

KME-4 showed anti-inflammatory activity. It was less active than indomethacin, but more active than naproxen and ibuprofen in carrageenin-induced paw edema in rats; and it was less active than indomethacin, equipotent as naproxen, but more active than ibuprofen in granuloma formation in rats. The ulcerogenic activity of KME-4 was weaker than indomethacin and naproxen, but stronger than ibuprofen in starved rats. The ratio of UD50 stomach to ED30 carrageenin edema or to ED25 granuloma for KME-4 showed higher values than those of the reference drugs. KME-4 showed antipyretic activity in yeast-induced fever in rats. It also inhibited platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid and protected rabbits from arachidonic acid-induced death. Furthermore, KME-4 was found to be equipotent in inhibiting both prostaglandin synthetase and 5-lipoxygenase activities of rat basophilic leukemia cells, unlike indomethacin, naproxen and ibuprofen. It also inhibited the prostaglandin synthetase activity of bovine seminal vesicle. The present findings indicate that KME-4 may be a new type of anti-inflammatory drug with dual prostaglandin synthetase and 5-lipoxygenase inhibition.","['Hidaka, T', 'Hosoe, K', 'Ariki, Y', 'Takeo, K', 'Yamashita, T', 'Katsumi, I', 'Kondo, H', 'Yamashita, K', 'Watanabe, K']","['Hidaka T', 'Hosoe K', 'Ariki Y', 'Takeo K', 'Yamashita T', 'Katsumi I', 'Kondo H', 'Yamashita K', 'Watanabe K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Jpn J Pharmacol,Japanese journal of pharmacology,2983305R,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '83677-24-1 (KME 4)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'OL659KIY4X (4-Butyrolactone)']",IM,"['4-Butyrolactone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Arachidonate Lipoxygenases', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/toxicity', '*Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Edema/drug therapy', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Granuloma/prevention & control', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Stomach Ulcer/chemically induced']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Pharmacol. 1984 Sep;36(1):77-85. doi: 10.1254/jjp.36.77.,['10.1254/jjp.36.77 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

One case of common ALL (cALL), one case of T-ALL, and one undifferentiated acute leukemia that responded to anti-myeloid drugs after unsuccessful anti-lymphoid induction therapy, had germ line heavy chain genes. Rearranged immunoglobulin genes were instead found in 15 of the 16 cALL cases studied and in a case of non-T, non-B, non-common (""null"") ALL, which suggested the B cell origin of the neoplastic cells. All cases bearing a heavy chain gene rearrangement were HLA-DR positive. However, the unique cALL case with a germ line configuration was also HLA-DR positive, which confirmed that both the cALL antigen and HLA-DR antigen were not per se expression of B cell commitment. On the other hand, a complete search for B cell-related markers (BA-1 and B1 monoclonal antibodies, as well as cytoplasmic immunoglobulins [CyIg]) in the cALL cases showed that at least one B cell marker could be detected either on primary or on TPA-induced cells in all cases in which a gene rearrangement had occurred. Incubation with TPA allowed the detection of one B cell marker in a case in which the primary cells were negative, and increased the expression of B cell markers in all but one of the cALLs tested. The only cALL case that was not rearranged expressed no B cell markers either on primary or on TPA-induced cells. The non-T, non-B, non-common (""null"") case that was rearranged also showed no phenotypic evidence of B cell markers on primary and induced cells. These findings indicate that: (a) practically all cases of cALL appear to be of B cell origin as shown by gene rearrangement analysis; (b) DNA studies are relevant for a more precise characterization of individual cases of undifferentiated acute leukemia; (c) a complete survey for B cell markers may establish the B cell origin of the cALL blasts, as long as the analysis on primary cells is complemented by differentiation induction assessment; and (d) most cases of non-T ALL appear to be characterized by the expansion of neoplastic cells ""frozen"" at different levels along the B cell differentiation pathway, the first detectable marker being heavy chain gene rearrangement, followed by BA-1, B1, and CyIg expression.","['Foa, R', 'Migone, N', 'Saitta, M', 'Fierro, M T', 'Giubellino, M C', 'Lusso, P', 'Cordero di Montezemolo, L', 'Miniero, R', 'Lauria, F']","['Foa R', 'Migone N', 'Saitta M', 'Fierro MT', 'Giubellino MC', 'Lusso P', 'Cordero di Montezemolo L', 'Miniero R', 'Lauria F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Nov;74(5):1756-63. doi: 10.1172/JCI111594.,['10.1172/JCI111594 [doi]'],,PMC425355,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Spm depletion was accomplished by treating cultured L1210 cells for 96 hr with alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and an analog of Spd such as aminopropylcadaverine, N4-methylSpd, N4-ethylSpd, or homoSpd. DFMO, a specific inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, halts continued polyamine biosynthesis and the Spd analog serves as a functional substitute for Spd. Thus, while the Spd analog fulfills the role(s) of Spd in cell proliferation, Spm becomes steadily depleted. In cells treated with DFMO plus the analog, aminopropylcadaverine, Spm pools decline steadily and growth inhibition occus after 48 hr (when Spm pools decline to 60% of control). By 96 hr, Spm is approximately 15% of control and growth is less than 30%. Prevention studies with exogenous polyamines confirm a causal relationship between Spm depletion and growth inhibition. The critical levels of polyamines for cell proliferation to take place were found to be 30% of control for Spd and 60% for Spm. The use of DFMO plus a Spd analog is proposed as a system for studying the cellular consequences of Spm depletion. Spd depletion can be achieved for comparison purposes by treating cells with DFMO alone.","['Casero, R A Jr', 'Bergeron, R J', 'Porter, C W']","['Casero RA Jr', 'Bergeron RJ', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eflornithine', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Spermine/*metabolism']",1984/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1984 Dec;121(3):476-82. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041210305.,['10.1002/jcp.1041210305 [doi]'],"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

(1983) Science (Wash. D.C.) 220, 509-511). Consequently, we have studied the enzymatic basis and organization of Gb3 expression in Burkitt as compared with non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines. Burkitt lymphoma cell lines (Ramos, Daudi, Put) were characterized by a high chemical quantity of Gb3, high enzyme activity for synthesis of Gb3 (UDP-Gal:LacCer alpha-galactosyltransferase), and a high degree of surface exposure of Gb3, as determined by galactose oxidase/NaB[3H]4 and by cytofluorometry with the monoclonal antibody to Gb3 (38.13). Non-Burkitt lymphoblastoid cell lines (Priess, Remb1, and ARH77) were characterized by the absence of Gb3 at the cell surface detected by cytofluorometry or cell-surface labeling. The cell lines Priess and Remb1 did not contain Gb3 and showed a low alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, the cell line ARH77, though it did not express Gb3 at the cell surface, was found to contain a large chemical quantity of Gb3 and a high level of alpha-galactosyltransferase activity for Gb3 synthesis. However, Gb3 of ARH77 cells was exposed by sialidase treatment, but not by protease treatment, although Gb3 itself was not sialylated. The crypticity of Gb3 in ARH77 cells could be associated with an adjacent sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate at the cell surface, in the same way as Gg3 in mouse lymphoma L5178 (Urdal, D. L., and Hakomori, S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 6869-6874). Thus, the expression in Burkitt and non-Burkitt lymphoma is dependent on (i) Gb3 synthesis due to alpha-galactosyltransferase activity and (ii) membrane organization of Gb3, which may be controlled through interaction with the sialosyl residue of a second glycoconjugate.","['Wiels, J', 'Holmes, E H', 'Cochran, N', 'Tursz, T', 'Hakomori, S']","['Wiels J', 'Holmes EH', 'Cochran N', 'Tursz T', 'Hakomori S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Globosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Trihexosylceramides)', '71965-57-6 (globotriaosylceramide)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (UDP-galactose-lactosylceramide alpha 1-4-galactosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Galactosyltransferases/analysis', 'Globosides/*analysis', 'Glycolipids/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Trihexosylceramides']",1984/12/10 00:00,1984/12/10 00:01,['1984/12/10 00:00'],"['1984/12/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Dec 10;259(23):14783-7.,['S0021-9258(17)42671-8 [pii]'],"['CA19224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23100/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Now is the time for large studies which control for the multitudinous variables of patient population such as disease status, protective environment, degree of diet sterility, and types of GI and mucocutaneous decontamination. Meanwhile, it is impossible to make hard and fast rules for prophylaxis for all circumstances. Clearly, most of the measures which we have discussed are applicable only where there is profound immunosuppression. Practice should be based on a careful evaluation of the local flora and fauna. Table 6 details an outline of the Royal Free prophylaxis schedule concurrently used during the treatment of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia and following marrow transplantation.

Historically, there have been many attempts to stimulate the immune response with nonspecific immunomodulators in the form of bacterial extracts, viruses, and chemicals. Although these approaches have occasionally proven useful under defined conditions in experimental models, their extension to the clinic has been largely unsuccessful. Recent advances in molecular biology and hybridoma technology have made available genetically engineered lymphokines and cytokines, as well as monoclonal antibodies, as highly purified biologicals for cancer treatment. These agents may act directly on tumor cells and/or may act on the patient's own biological responses to induce an antitumor response. Selective defects in T-cell function have recently been identified in cancer patients and in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Simultaneously, the availability of gamma interferon (gamma-IF) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) may allow for the selective correction of these T-cell deficits, leading to restoration of the patient's immune responses and perhaps correction of the clinical syndromes. Preliminary data suggest that gamma-IF and IL-2 have in vitro activity on these T-cell defects, and the preliminary evidence that these agents have activity in vivo will be reviewed. Extensive trials are being conducted at the National Cancer Institute with monoclonal antibodies as anticancer agents. Animal model experiments have demonstrated considerable antitumor activity of immunoconjugates using monoclonal antibodies tied to toxins. Preliminary clinical results suggest that T-101 in leukemia and lymphoma and 9.2.27 in malignant melanoma may prove useful as specific reagents in the treatment of these disorders. While the antitumor effects with these antibodies have not been dramatic, our preliminary data in approximately 30 patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and melanoma clearly demonstrate the ability of intravenous monoclonal antibody to locate and specifically label tumor cells bearing the target antigens. It has been possible to localize antibody on the tumor cells in melanoma deposits that are barely visible in the skin. These data and radioimaging data suggest a future role for immunoconjugates as anticancer agents.","['Oldham, R K', 'Thurman, G B', 'Talmadge, J E', 'Stevenson, H C', 'Foon, K A']","['Oldham RK', 'Thurman GB', 'Talmadge JE', 'Stevenson HC', 'Foon KA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biological Products)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Biological Products/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-gamma/therapeutic use', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/*therapeutic use', 'Melanoma/immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Dec 1;54(11 Suppl):2795-806. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2795::aid-cncr2820541427>3.0.co;2-e.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2795::aid-cncr2820541427>3.0.co;2-e [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the serum and urine of 36 consecutive CLL patients for monoclonal proteins using sensitive immunochemical methods (high resolution agarose gel electrophoresis combined with immunofixation). The results obtained were correlated with the Rai stage, quantitative immunoglobulin levels, and lymphocyte membrane immunoglobulin phenotype of the leukemic cells. Twenty-three monoclonal proteins were identified in the serum or urine of 22 patients, an incidence of 61%.

Cells treated with A23187 alone progressed through the cell cycle more slowly than the untreated cells and their cloning efficiency was reduced. In both cell strains the ionophore prolonged duration of the postirradiation mitotic delay. Radiation-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was reversed by A23187 in LY-S but not in LY-R cells. Cells subjected to the ionophore treatment survived X-irradiation in almost the same way as untreated cells, as if the effect of A23187 treatment were reversed by irradiation. There was also a reversion in the ion content: A23187 caused a marked increase in Na+ content and a decrease in K+ content, irradiation itself did not change the ion content, whereas in the A23187-treated cells it restored almost the same pattern as that found in the control cells. We found less Mg2+ ions in LY-S cells after treatment with A23187 and A23187 + X than in LY-R cells, in relation to untreated (control) cells.

The antibiotics, including cefotiam, cefsulodin, cefmenoxime, cefazolin and sulbenicillin, were proved to be almost completely removed by the ARD. Bacteria were detected only by use of the ARD in the blood cultures from 2 of 21 blood specimens (11 patients) entered in the study, while all of the blood cultures were negative by the conventional method. These isolated bacteria were S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, of which septicemias were cured by intensive antibiotic therapy for these bacteria.

After purification, apparently homogeneous Paju ornithine decarboxylase was inactivated with [3H]difluoromethylornithine and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Under denaturing conditions it was found to have an altered molecular structure, i.e. two nonidentical subunits of Mr = 55,000 and 60,000.

We report here that retinoic acid (RA) enhanced the level of this enzyme in two human transformed cell lines, WISH and Namalva. Like IFN, RA induced 2-5A synthetase activity in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Addition of anti IFN-alpha, -IFN-beta, or -IFN-gamma antibodies to the medium concomitantly with RA did not prevent such induction; therefore, the effect of RA is clearly not mediated through the induction and externalization of IFN. Pretreatment of cells with actinomycin D inhibited 2-5A synthetase induction by RA, suggesting that RA increased the transcription of the 2-5A synthetase gene. In WISH cells, the growth of encephalomyocarditis virus was inhibited by RA treatment, which is consistent with the hypothesis that 2-5A synthetase plays an important role in the antiviral action of IFN, at least in encephalomyocarditis virus replication. When the anticellular effects of IFN and RA were compared to their ability to induce 2-5A synthetase activity in four human cell lines, there was no strict correlation between the amplitude of the enzyme activity induced and the extent of the antiproliferative effect. It is concluded that the 2-5A system is probably not the only pathway responsible for the antiproliferative effect of both substances. We further suggest that the induction of 2-5A synthetase by IFN and RA might be connected with at least some of the similarities observed between other biological effects of both compounds.","['Bourgeade, M F', 'Besancon, F']","['Bourgeade MF', 'Besancon F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*biosynthesis"", 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Placenta', 'Pregnancy', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Nov;44(11):5355-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane permeability of the molecule has been compared to that of methylthioadenosine in intact human erythrocytes and Friend erythroleukemia cells. The formycinyl compound is taken up with a rate significantly lower than that of 5'-methylthioadenosine and is not metabolized by the cells. 5'-Methylthioformycin inhibits Friend erythroleukemia cells' growth: the effect is dose-dependent, fully reversible and not caused by cytotoxicity. Several enzymes related to methylthioadenosine metabolism are inhibited by methylthioformycin. Rat liver methylthioadenosine phosphorylase is competitively inhibited with a Ki value of 2 microM. Among the propylamine transferases tested only rat brain spermine synthase is significantly inhibited, while rat brain spermidine synthase is less sensitive. Rat liver S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase is irreversibly inactivated with 50% inhibition at 400 microM methylthioformycin. 5'-Methylthioformycin does not exert any significant effect on protein carboxyl-O-methyltransferase.

Fetal liver cells from midgestation BALB/c embryos were plated onto BAB-14 bone marrow stromal cell-adherent layers. After a 3-5 wk period, cell growth began to increase and these cells were expanded in number on fresh feeder layers. The cultured fetal liver cells were lymphoid in morphology, 5-20% cytoplasmic Ig-positive, but less than 1% surface Ig-positive. Southern blot analysis of the cultured fetal liver cells, as well as cultured bone marrow-derived B cells, demonstrated a population with germline Ig heavy chain loci, possibly representing very early B cell precursors. Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) clonal transformants of such cultured fetal liver cells had a phenotypic distribution similar to that seen with fresh fetal liver transformants but distinct from those obtained with the transformation of either cultured or fresh bone marrow. All A-MuLV transformants isolated had rearrangements at the mu heavy chain locus of both chromosomes, irrespective of Ig production. In addition, most mu heavy chain producers had at least one rearranged kappa gene locus. These long-term fetal liver cultures provide large numbers of cells for studying events early in the B lymphocyte lineage. The cultured fetal liver cells retained phenotypic traits similar to fresh fetal liver B cells and distinctive from bone marrow cells cultured under similar conditions.","['Denis, K A', 'Treiman, L J', 'St Claire, J I', 'Witte, O N']","['Denis KA', 'Treiman LJ', 'St Claire JI', 'Witte ON']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antibody Diversity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Female', 'Fetus/*cytology/physiology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/genetics', 'Liver/*cytology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1984 Oct 1;160(4):1087-101. doi: 10.1084/jem.160.4.1087.,['10.1084/jem.160.4.1087 [doi]'],['CA 09120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2187467,,,,,,,,,,

These data suggest that BALB/c and BCL1 share an antigen, which if present in the host prevents the immune cells from eradicating the tumor. The antigen is controlled by H-40, a gene that maps to the C end of the Igh complex, telomeric to Tsu and in the region of Pre-1. The ability of H-40 to act as a tumor antigen for other BALB/c tumors inoculated into C.B-20 hosts was investigated. H-40 did not elicit rejection of P1798 (T lymphoma), Meth A (fibrosarcoma), or MOPC-315 (alpha, lambda myeloma) tumor cells. C.B-20 mice that previously rejected BCL1, however, showed partial resistance to a low challenge dose of the MOPC-104E (mu, lambda myeloma) tumor. These data suggest that H-40 has a differential degree of expression on BALB/c tumor cells. The ability of the adoptively transferred cells to confer protection against BCL1 is abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with anti-Lyt-1 or anti-Lyt-2 antibodies. However, an admixture of anti-Lyt-1- and anti-Lyt-2-treated cells provided protection. These data, together with the results detected by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activity in vitro, indicate that H-40 can serve as a target antigen for tumor rejection by CTL in allogeneic hosts.

Percoll-purified NK cells, containing 40% HNK-1+ cells and less than 1 to 4% esterase-positive contaminating monocytes, can generate a strong CL response after stimulation with the NK-susceptible K562 tumor but not with the NK-resistant P815 tumor cells. Although the response was NK dependent, as shown by depletion with NK-directed monoclonal antibodies (HNK-1, OKT-11, and OKM-1), the cell generating the CL response was not the NK cell. On the basis of several independent experimental approaches the CL response always required the presence of monocytes in the NK preparation. a) Treatment with a monocyte-specific monoclonal antibody (MO2) and complement completely abolished CL. b) The cells producing the CL response were strongly adherent to nylon wool columns (NWC), and large granular lymphocyte preparations containing less than 0.1% esterase-positive cells were inactive. c) NK cells cultured in IL 2-containing medium and tested over several days did not generate CL. d) Optimal numbers of monocytes (less than 1 to 2%) added to a non-CL NWC-purified NK population restored CL, whereas larger or smaller amounts were ineffective. Neither these procedures nor the addition of superoxide dismutase (which completely blocked CL) had any effect on NK lytic activity. We subsequently demonstrated that a factor present in supernatants obtained from NK/K562 incubations, but not from NK or tumor cells alone, could stimulate monocyte CL. We therefore propose that the CL response measured in NK-enriched Percoll fractions originated from contaminating monocytes that were triggered by factor(s) released from tumor-activated NK cells, and that superoxide anion was not required for NK lysis.","['Pohajdak, B', 'Gomez, J L', 'Wilkins, J A', 'Greenberg, A H']","['Pohajdak B', 'Gomez JL', 'Wilkins JA', 'Greenberg AH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Separation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', '*Luminescent Measurements', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Monocytes/immunology/*metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Proteins/physiology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Nov;133(5):2430-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High-molecular-weight oligosaccharides which are predominant in HL-60 cells, decreased slightly during myeloid differentiation and markedly during monocytoid differentiation with concomitant increase of biantennary oligosaccharides. Structural analyses revealed that the induced monocytoid cells contain a series of complex-type oligosaccharides with bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary structures and high-molecular-weight oligosaccharides with N-acetyllactosamine repeating units, which show diversity in the presence or absence of the fucose residue linked to the reducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine, of the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue, and of the X-antigenic determinant in their outer chain moieties. Methylation analysis of each class of oligosaccharides of HL-60 cells and of their differentiated counterparts revealed the presence of similar heterogeneity in their structures, indicating that the difference is only quantitative. The results show that the shifts in size of the oligosaccharides found in the differentiated cells are derived from changes in outer chain formation and elongation of N-acetyllactosamine repeating units, and thus suggests that the decreased expression of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases may be involved especially in the monocytoid differentiation program.","['Mizoguchi, A', 'Takasaki, S', 'Maeda, S', 'Kobata, A']","['Mizoguchi A', 'Takasaki S', 'Maeda S', 'Kobata A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Oligosaccharides)', '0 (asialooligosaccharides)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.103 (keratan-sulfate endo-1,4-beta-galactosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['*Asparagine', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Paper', '*Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",1984/10/10 00:00,1984/10/10 00:01,['1984/10/10 00:00'],"['1984/10/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Oct 10;259(19):11949-57.,['S0021-9258(20)71303-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found to be a powerful competitive inhibitor of adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50), yet the lack of the methyl group at the glyoxal portion increased the apparent Ki value for the enzyme by about 30-fold in comparison with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). Glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) inhibited diamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6) activity as effectively as did methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). The cellular accumulation curves of glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) in L1210 cells were practically superimposable with those of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), and the uptake of both compounds was distinctly stimulated by a prior treatment with 2-difluoromethylornithine. The drug decreased the concentration of spermidine in a dose-dependent manner and, in contrast with methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), without a concomitant accumulation of putrescine. The fact that putrescine concentrations were decreased in cells exposed to glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was, at least in part, attributable to an inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17) activity in cells treated with the compound. Under these experimental conditions equivalent concentrations of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) [1,1'-[(methylethanediylidine)dinitrilo]diguanidine] elicited large increases in the enzyme activity. When combined with difluoromethylornithine, glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) potentiated the growth-inhibitory effect of that drug. Taking into consideration the proven anti-leukaemic activity of glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), its effectiveness to inhibit spermidine biosynthesis (without raising the concentration of putrescine) as well as its suitability for combined use with inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase, this drug is apparently worthy of further testing in tumour-bearing animals, especially in combination with difluoromethylornithine or related inhibitors of ornithine decarboxylase.","['Seppanen, P', 'Fagerstrom, R', 'Alhonen-Hongisto, L', 'Elo, H', 'Lumme, P', 'Janne, J']","['Seppanen P', 'Fagerstrom R', 'Alhonen-Hongisto L', 'Elo H', 'Lumme P', 'Janne J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Polyamines)', '14358-42-0 (glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone))', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 1.4.3.21 (Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing))', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Amine Oxidase (Copper-Containing)/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/enzymology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Eflornithine', 'Female', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitoguazone/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Polyamines/*metabolism']",1984/07/15 00:00,1984/07/15 00:01,['1984/07/15 00:00'],"['1984/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1984 Jul 15;221(2):483-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2210483.,['10.1042/bj2210483 [doi]'],,PMC1144063,,,,,,,,,,

These five patients all had malignant disease and could be subdivided into two groups. In the first group were three patients, each with an associated serum IgM paraprotein; two had Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and one lymphocytic lymphoma. The two patients of the second group did not have IgM paraproteins; one had lymphocytic lymphoma and one chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both these patients also had acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, a previously recognised association with circulating LMW IgM. None of the 16 patients with benign IgM macroglobulinemia had circulating LMW IgM. In those positive sera with LMW IgM this moiety contributed between 10.5% and 37.5% of the total IgM. There was no apparent association between LMW IgM and total IgM levels, kappa/lambda typing or the presence of Bence Jones proteinuria, but rheumatoid factor, immune complexes and cryoglobulins occurred in many of the sera which contained LMW IgM. Pokeweed mitogen stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from two patients with circulating LMW IgM secreted considerable quantities of this moiety in vitro but this did not occur in two patients with benign IgM macroglobulinemia. We conclude that LMW IgM is found in the malignant but not the benign forms of B cell lymphoproliferative disorders and is frequently associated with other serological abnormalities.

With more effective systemic chemotherapy programs (especially in acute leukemia in children), the incidence of meningeal tumor involvement has increased. Even though a number of systemically administered agents might be used in treating the CNS, only three have been used intrathecally with good clinical results: the antimetabolites methotrexate (MTX) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and the alkylating derivative thiophosphoramide (thio-TEPA). Drug distribution in the CSF which is injected by lumbar puncture does not generally allow for delivery of effective quantities of drug to the cisternae nor the ventricles. Thus direct intraventricular injection via a subcutaneously implanted (Ommaya) reservoir is necessary to achieve adequate drug levels in the higher CNS cavities. The peak ventricular concentration of MTX, which was administered by Ommaya reservoir, at a dose of 15mg/m2, was 2.5 +/- 0.9 X 10(-4)M, and remained as a level of 10(-6)M for 72 hours with a half-life of 10.5 hours. During an intravenous 6 hour-infusion at a dose of 750-3,000mg/m2, MTX concentration in CSF reached 8.2 X 10(-7)M to 2.7 X 10(-6)M. The drug content in CSF had a linear concentration related to the drug level in plasma. Intrathecal MTX and Ara-C frequently cause symptoms of meningeal irritation. Occasionally cases of weakness and paralysis and rare instances of severe encephalopathy may occur. The best established causes of these symptoms is high concentration of these drugs in the CSF, or prolonged exposure of the brain to low CSF concentration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Fujimoto, T']",['Fujimoto T'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Chromium-51-labeling of hematologic cells and lymphocytes has been used for years to study the migration and sequestration of these cells in the spleen and other sites. The substantial recirculation of lymphocytes from blood into lymphoid tissue and back into blood is well described. Recently, new approaches for radiosotopic cell labeling have gained prominence in the investigation of various aspects of malignant diseases and in the clinical care of such patients. Isotopes such as indium-111 can be visualized with standard scanning techniques providing further information about the migration of normal and malignant cells has been discovered. In vivo studies have been performed with indium-111 in animals and humans, including comparisons of the migration of abnormal cells (malignant) and of lymphocytes to abnormal nodes. Evaluation and comparison of the migration of carcinoma cells, normal lymphoid cells, and malignant lymphoid cells in animals show markedly different patterns of distribution, which could have bearing on investigations of mechanisms of metastasis. In vivo human studies also have evaluated the migration patterns of lymphoid cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and well-differentiated lymphoma, showing very different migrating behavior between these two polarities of a similar disease. These types of studies, while initially phenomenonologic, may provide a basis for a better understanding of these diseases. There are concerns about the use of an isotope such as indium-111 for the labeling of long-lived cells such as lymphocytes. Laboratory studies have demonstrated impaired cell function at high concentrations of radioactivity. Some workers have expressed concern about long-term changes in cells that recirculate. Others cite precedents of other long-term uses of isotopes, therapeutically, without detrimental effects. These concerns continue to be investigated. Finally, an area of much interest in the use of indium-111 is the labeling of granulocytes. This technique has been useful diagnostically, to localize infections. The major value in patients with malignancy, primarily with hematologic malignancies, is to evaluate the potential benefit of granulocyte transfusions. Many of these patients develop prolonged granulocytopenia and become infected, and granulocyte transfusions may become a therapeutic consideration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Dutcher, J P']",['Dutcher JP'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,1264464,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '045A6V3VFX (Indium)', '14514-42-2 (indium oxine)', '5UTX5635HP (Oxyquinoline)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/diagnostic imaging', 'Animals', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cell Movement', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', '*Granulocytes/transplantation', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Indium', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnostic imaging', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnostic imaging', '*Lymphocytes', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnostic imaging', 'Neoplasms/*diagnostic imaging', '*Organometallic Compounds', 'Oxyquinoline/analogs & derivatives', '*Radioisotopes', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Rats', 'Sezary Syndrome/diagnostic imaging']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Nucl Med. 1984 Jul;14(3):251-61. doi: 10.1016/s0001-2998(84)80018-5.,"['S0001-2998(84)80018-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0001-2998(84)80018-5 [doi]']",,,57,,,,,,,,,

In six consecutive experiments the relative increase in Ia expression induced by P388 SN was 4.9 +/- 0.9, with FS6 Con A SN 10.7 +/- 1.5, and with a combination of both preparations 13.0 +/- 1.7. This increase in Ia expression was observed to occur in virtually all the B cells, reaching maximum levels within 24 h of culture. The interleukin-induced increase in B cell Ia expression occurred in the absence of ancillary signals provided by ligand-receptor Ig cross-linking and despite the fact that virtually all the control B cells, cultured in the absence of factors, remained in G0. These results suggest that functional receptors for at least some interleukins are expressed on normal resting B cells and their effects can be manifest in the absence of additional activating signals. The increased Ia expression induced by the nonspecific factor preparations was shown to be correlated with enhanced antigen-presenting capacity by the B cells to T cell hybridomas. The nature of the interleukins responsible for these effects remains to be definitively determined, however, the activity of FS6 Con A SN was shown to correlate with B cell growth factor activity and increased B cell Ia expression was not observed using interleukin 2 (IL-2) or interferon-gamma, prepared by recombinant DNA technology.","['Roehm, N W', 'Leibson, H J', 'Zlotnik, A', 'Kappler, J', 'Marrack, P', 'Cambier, J C']","['Roehm NW', 'Leibson HJ', 'Zlotnik A', 'Kappler J', 'Marrack P', 'Cambier JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (concanavalin A-induced helper factors)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Concanavalin A/analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', '*Lymphokines', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Ovalbumin/immunology']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1984 Sep 1;160(3):679-94. doi: 10.1084/jem.160.3.679.,['10.1084/jem.160.3.679 [doi]'],"['AI-17134/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20519/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187406,,,,,,,,,,

In each case these antibodies immunoprecipitated disulfide-linked heterodimer molecules from their respective leukemic cells. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of the two idiotype-bearing molecules a major difference in molecular weight was observed, which could be attributed to a similar difference in size of the heavily iodinated chain of either heterodimer. The lightly iodinated chains of both molecules co-migrated at 43 Kd, but appeared to have different isoelectric points on two-dimensional gel analysis. The possibility that these two different heterodimers correspond to different classes of the putative T cell receptor for antigen is discussed. Assays of proliferation of the leukemic cells using Sepharose-bound antiidiotype-like monoclonal antibody showed that one of the leukemic cell types proliferated readily in response to its antiidiotypic antibody. This proliferation was not associated with measurable production of IL-2 and appeared to be a direct effect of the antiidiotypic antibody, which may mimic antigen in its interaction with the T cell receptor for antigen. The other leukemic cell type did not respond to Sepharose-bound antiidiotypic antibody and was generally unresponsive to lymphokines and mitogens. It is possible that the two leukemic cell types represent different stages of T cell differentiation.","['Posnett, D N', 'Bigler, R D', 'Bushkin, Y', 'Fisher, D E', 'Wang, C Y', 'Mayer, L F', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Kunkel, H G']","['Posnett DN', 'Bigler RD', 'Bushkin Y', 'Fisher DE', 'Wang CY', 'Mayer LF', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Kunkel HG']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Precipitin Tests', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1984 Aug 1;160(2):494-505. doi: 10.1084/jem.160.2.494.,['10.1084/jem.160.2.494 [doi]'],"['1 R23 CA 35463-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 10811-19/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187451,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present further evidence for their identity with the T-dependent or atypical subset of mast cells and show that they retain characteristics of T-dependent mast cells when transferred in vivo. One week after the injection of P cells into the dermis of mutant Wf/Wf mice, which have a genetically determined deficiency in mast cells, large numbers of mast cells were present at the injection site, although by 2 wk or later these had disappeared. These mast cells resembled T-dependent mast cells rather than connective tissue mast cells in terms of their size and staining characteristics. Further evidence that these mast cells belonged to the T-dependent subset was that they retained their sensitivity to PSF. Thus, if P cells were injected into the dermis of Wf/Wf mice that bore in one groin a subcutaneous tumor (WEHI-3B) that produced PSF, increased numbers of mast cells were still evident at the injection site 4 wk later; this was not the case in mice bearing a non-PSF-producing variant of the same tumor. Experiments with cloned P cells generated from mice bearing the beige (bgJ/bgJ) mutation and with the giant granules of cells of this genotype used as a marker showed conclusively that the mast cells at the injection sites were derived from the injected P cells. P cells sensitized in vitro with monoclonal antigen-specific IgE or IgG1 antibodies and then injected intracutaneously into W/Wv mice transferred local cutaneous anaphylactic responses. P cells sensitized with IgG1 transferred local cutaneous anaphylactic responses to rats. These results support the view that P cell lines are cognate with the atypical or T-dependent subset of mast cells and that these cells retain their functional capabilities when injected in vivo.","['Crapper, R M', 'Thomas, W R', 'Schrader, J W']","['Crapper RM', 'Thomas WR', 'Schrader JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",IM,"['Anaphylaxis/immunology/pathology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Growth Substances/metabolism', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/immunology/physiology/*transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Oct;133(4):2174-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glutaraldehyde (2 X 10(-4%)) enhanced both the level and rate of lysis mediated by NKCF when the factor was prebound to the L929 target cell. However, glutaraldehyde enhanced lysis only when added at specific time points (2 to 4 hr after addition of NKCF, which was 6 to 8 hr before any lysis occurred), indicating that NKCF-mediated lysis is a dynamic process. When 10(-3%) glutaraldehyde was added at the same time as NKCF, inhibition of lysis was observed. Pretreatment of L929 target cells, but not of NKCF, with glutaraldehyde resulted in inhibition of NKCF-mediated cytolysis. In addition, it was shown that glutaraldehyde-pretreated L929 and K562 cold target cells were not as effective in competing for binding of NKCF in a cold target competition assay, or as effective in absorbing NKCF at 4 degrees C, indicating that glutaraldehyde modified the NKCF receptor to block binding of NKCF to the target cell. Thus, NKCF-mediated cytolysis can be divided into at least four substages based upon sequential modulation by glutaraldehyde: 1) NKCF binding stage (inhibited by glutaraldehyde), 2) glutaraldehyde-enhanceable nonlytic stage, 3) glutaraldehyde-nonenhanceable nonlytic stage, and 4) glutaraldehyde-nonenhanceable lytic stage.","['Deem, R L', 'Targan, S R']","['Deem RL', 'Targan SR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Proteins)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Glutaral/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Mice', 'Proteins/*pharmacology']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Oct;133(4):1836-40.,,['AI-15332/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Mice injected in one footpad with keyhole limpet haemocyanin or intravenously with sheep erythrocytes had substantial increases in numbers of splenic P cell precursors; the increase following the sheep erythrocytes did not occur in athymic mice implying a dependence on T lymphocytes. The increase in P cell precursors correlated with the local release of PSF; thus cells from the ipsilateral draining lymph node of mice injected in one footpad with KLH, but not cells from the contralateral node, showed both increased numbers of P cell precursors and the production of PSF. PSF could, in other situations, enter the circulation and exert effects distal to its release. Mice bearing a localized tumour that produced PSF (WEHI-3B), but not those bearing a non-producing subline, showed both a significant increase in P cell precursors in the spleen and bone marrow, and a marked increase in the numbers of mast cells, megakaryocytes, metamyelocytes and polymorphs in the spleen. PSF was detected in the serum of the mice bearing the PSF-producing tumour. Following intravenous injection of PSF into normal mice there was a rapid initial clearance (t 1/2 4 min), followed after 10 mins by a phase of slower clearance (t 1/2 40 min). This was due to removal of PSF rather than inhibition or destruction by serum factors, as when PSF was mixed in vitro with mouse serum for 24 hr at 37 degrees, no activity was lost.","['Crapper, R M', 'Clark-Lewis, I', 'Schrader, J W']","['Crapper RM', 'Clark-Lewis I', 'Schrader JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood', 'Immunization', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA']",1984/09/01 00:00,1984/09/01 00:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1984 Sep;53(1):33-42.,,,PMC1454724,,,,,,,,,,

Two preparations of IFN-gamma were utilized, one which was not glycosylated and which was highly purified from Escherichia coli another which was glycosylated and which was from transfected COS-7 monkey cells. Both preparations of recombinant IFN-gamma activated murine macrophages to kill lymphoma and melanoma tumor targets, suggesting that glycosylation of the protein or the presence of other mammalian proteins is not essential for activation. Significant levels of cytolytic activity were induced from IFN-gamma (1 to 10 units/ml). This activity was undiminished by treatment of the IFN-gamma preparations with polymixin B at doses which neutralized endotoxin (50 micrograms/ml). Similarly, IFN-gamma, at low concentrations, induced an inhibition of migration by macrophages. Based on antiviral activity, IFN-gamma was shown to be 100 to 1000 times more potent than was IFN-beta as a macrophage-activating agent. Taken together, these results demonstrate that murine IFN-gamma is a macrophage-activating factor which is effective at physiological concentrations.

Spermidine is required for DNA replication, and the intracellular depletion of this polyamine can be used to distinguish cellular events related to proliferation. We have demonstrated previously that depletion of intracellular spermidine results in cytostasis of human HL-60 promyelocytes. The inhibition of HL-60 proliferation is associated with inhibition of differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, butyric acid, and retinoic acid. The present studies extend these findings by monitoring the effects of spermidine depletion and inhibition of DNA replication on induction of HL-60 differentiation by leukocyte-conditioned medium and phorbol ester. The results demonstrate that both inducers enhance intracellular polyamine levels. However, depletion of intracellular spermidine inhibits induction of HL-60 differentiation by leukocyte-conditioned medium, but not by phorbol ester. Further, the addition of exogenous spermidine abrogates the inhibition of proliferation, and leukocyte-conditioned medium induced HL-60 differentiation, confirming the requirement of this polyamine for the expression of a differentiated phenotype.

In an attempt to investigate the roles of polyamines in gene-associated functions, we examined the effects of polyamine depletion on the spontaneous mutation rate in a rat basophilic leukemia cell line. The frequency of 6-thioguanine-resistant mutant cells increased by approximately 9-fold as a result of the treatment with alpha-difluoromethylornithine, a potent inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.17). This increase was prevented by supplementing the cultures with putrescine, suggesting that polyamine depletion, but not the direct mutagenic action of the enzyme inhibitor, is responsible for the mutant-increasing effect. These results suggest that polyamines may participate in the conservation of genetic information at either the chromosome or gene level.","['Kamatani, N', 'Nishioka, K', 'Morita, T', 'Morita, Y', 'Takeuchi, F', 'Matsuta, K', 'Nishida, Y', 'Miyamoto, T']","['Kamatani N', 'Nishioka K', 'Morita T', 'Morita Y', 'Takeuchi F', 'Matsuta K', 'Nishida Y', 'Miyamoto T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '12H3O2UGSF (Methylnitronitrosoguanidine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Eflornithine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Methylnitronitrosoguanidine/toxicity', '*Mutation', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Thioguanine/*toxicity']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Oct;44(10):4272-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) and glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) were much more effectively concentrated in the animal cells than was ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) was obviously attributable to the finding that the efflux rate of ethylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) greatly exceeded that of the other bis(guanylhydrazones).

This antibody stained the membranes of 2.24% of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. These cells were more common in T cell-depleted cell populations, and bore membrane immunoglobulin. Some B lymphoblastoid cell lines were also anti-HC2-positive. Examination of normal B cell subpopulations revealed that HC2-positive cells frequently co-express an activation antigen and membrane IgG. Cell populations enriched for HC2-positive cells contained the bulk of PWM-responsive B cells. These data suggest that HC2-bearing B cells are activated B cells. B cell differentiation induced in vitro by PWM with T cell helper factors resulted in an increase in the number of HC2-positive cells at day 4 or 5 of culture. The HC2-positive cells were no longer present at the time of maximal plasma cell differentiation on day 7 of culture. By using B cells from a patient with the hyper-IgM syndrome that are incapable of immunoglobulin heavy chain class switching, it was demonstrated that HC2 expression did not require prior heavy chain switch. The m.w. of the HC2 antigen was 52 to 63 KD. Four bands with different isoelectric points were discerned on two-dimensional analysis. We suggest that hairy cell leukemia represents a malignancy of activated B cells.

For example, with reference to hairy cell leukemia (HCL), cell marker data has been used in support of a monocytic, a T cell, or a B cell origin. If hairy cell leukemia is a B cell-derived neoplasm, the controversy may be resolved by genotyping the cells, using the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes as a marker of the B cell nature of the process. Rearrangement of these genes is detected using the Southern blot technique and cloned probes specific for the JH segment of the immunoglobulin genes. In this study, the arrangement of the immunoglobulin genes was analysed in normal tissue, in two accepted B cell lymphomas and in nine cases of hairy cell leukemia. DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes (two patients) and from the spleen (seven patients) revealed a discrete new JH restriction fragment length in the leukocytes of hairy cell leukemia cases. The presence of rearranged restriction fragments is interpreted as evidence of the existence of clonal B cell populations. Three of six samples had rearranged kappa light chain fragments. We conclude that most cases of hairy cell leukemia have a B cell genotype.

The following results were obtained: (a) Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) showed NK activity and a response in CL, which could be induced by viable or paraformaldehyde-fixed K562 target cells as well as by latex particles. (b) Both T cells and non-T cells exhibited NK activity, but T cells gave no K562- or latex-induced CL responses. (c) Depletion of phagocytic cells from MNC abolished CL, but only marginally affected NK activity. (d) Reconstitution of phagocyte-depleted MNC with adherent cells revealed a superadditive enhanced CL response, but had no augmenting effect on NK activity. (e) Phagocyte-depleted cell populations, enriched for NK activity by density gradient centrifugation, did not respond in K562- and latex-induced CL. (f) MNC, highly enriched for NK activity by cell sorting with a cytofluorograf using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled monoclonal antibody anti-Leu-11a, responded only with reduced CL, whereas the NK activity was enriched up to 45-fold.

The dose enhancement ratio was 1.97 at a control colony formation level of 5%. The basis for this enhancement was investigated at the level of DNA damage using a modified fluorometric assay to quantitate the production of alkaline-labile strand breaks per relative DNA molecular mass. Pretreatment of cultured L1210 cells for 48 hr with 5 mM DFMO depleted intracellular putrescine and spermidine (but not spermine) pools and resulted in a 2.3-fold increase in BCNU-induced (10 micrograms/ml, 2 hr) DNA strand breaks per relative DNA molecular mass. The inclusion of 10 microM spermidine during the DFMO pretreatment fully prevented growth inhibition and enhancement of BCNU-induced DNA damage while maintaining cellular spermidine pools at control levels. The inclusion of 2 microM putrescine or spermidine also prevented growth inhibition and enhancement of DNA damage while maintaining spermidine pools at only 25 to 35% of control. Thus, the portion of spermidine essential for cell growth appears to be associated with DNA. BCNU itself was found to reduce cellular polyamine levels by causing their leakage from cells. In addition, BCNU was found to react directly with spermidine in a cell-free system, resulting in a major reaction product detectable by high-performance liquid chromatography. While decreased interaction of BCNU with polyamines could account, in part, for enhancement effects of DFMO, it is more probable that alterations in DNA structure secondary to polyamine depletion are responsible for these effects.","['Cavanaugh, P F Jr', 'Pavelic, Z P', 'Porter, C W']","['Cavanaugh PF Jr', 'Pavelic ZP', 'Porter CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carmustine/*toxicity', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eflornithine', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Putrescine/pharmacology', 'Spermidine/pharmacology', 'Spermine/pharmacology']",1984/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/09/01 00:00'],"['1984/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Sep;44(9):3856-61.,,"['CA-22153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33321/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment of the fraction of DNA-synthesizing CFU-s with the [3H]thymidine suicide technique at the time of DMBA challenge and comparison with the 20-hr CFU-s reduction values by DMBA in vivo showed an inverse correlation (p less than 0.001). It was deduced, therefore, that S-phase CFU-s are relatively resistant to DMBA cytocide. Since initiation by chemical carcinogens has been shown to be relatively S-phase specific, S-phase-resistant cytocide would lead to a selection of initiated cells and, in the case of repeated applications, to a selection of cells with multiple successive initiation hits.

Five children had ""cafe au lait"" spots, 4 of them had familial history of neurofibromatosis. This frequent association confirms a genetic predisposition. Eight patients had one or several examinations of bone marrow and blood cytogenetics. Only one had an evident clonal abnormality: monosomy 7 (45 XY, -7) in all bone marrow cells. This monosomy 7 was discovered 21 months after the onset and 3 months before the blastic crisis. No chemotherapy had been used before this karyotype. Chemotherapeutic agents were essentially corticosteroids, 6 mercaptopurine and cytarabine.

The results indicate that the expressed mu chain gene is located on the normal chromosome 14, whereas the 14q+ translocation chromosome carries the excluded immunoglobulin constant (C) region mu chain allele (C mu) but does not contain variable (V) region heavy chain genes (VH).

With these results, it is logical to postulate that a gene, for which we suggest the name bcl-1, is located on band q13 of chromosome 11 and is activated by its translocation into close proximity with the rearranged heavy chain locus on chromosome 14q+, contributing to the neoplastic transformation of the B cells with the t(11;14) chromosomal translocation.","['Erikson, J', 'Finan, J', 'Tsujimoto, Y', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Erikson J', 'Finan J', 'Tsujimoto Y', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', '*Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1984 Jul;81(13):4144-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.81.13.4144.,['10.1073/pnas.81.13.4144 [doi]'],"['CA15822/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HD17561/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",PMC345385,,,,,,,,,,

Alpha BL2 recognizes a nonreducible single polypeptide with a m.w. of 68,000 that occasionally co-precipitates with a p29,34 complex of HLA-DR antigens. Alpha BL3 recognizes a nonreducible single polypeptide with a m.w. of 105,000 with an acidic pI point. We demonstrated that BL1 is expressed on fetal liver hematopoietic cells, a small subset (5 to 15%) of Ficoll-Hypaque-separated normal bone marrow cells, and on a subpopulation of nonadherent, non-E rosette-forming cells and granulocytes. BL2 is expressed on fetal liver hematopoietic cells, on 3 to 7% of normal bone marrow cells, and on a majority (40 to 70%) of nonadherent, non-E rosette-forming cells with a distinctive pattern similar to that of HLA-DR. BL3 is expressed on a subpopulation of nonadherent, non-E rosette-forming cells, and on occasional cells in the monocyte-enriched adherent cell population. The peak fluorescence for BL2 is substantially higher than that of BL1 and BL3, indicating higher BL2 antigen density. All three antigens are absent from thymocytes and E rosette-positive T cell fractions obtained from various lymphoid tissues. Cellular distribution of the BL antigens on various well-characterized established hematopoietic cell lines, leukemias, and malignant lymphomas, in conjunction with the results of the in vitro activation and TPA-induction experiments, suggest that BL1 is expressed during early developmental stages of B cell differentiation, whereas BL3 is expressed at the later stages. BL2 expression spans immature and mature stages of B cell differentiation, with the exception of mature plasma cells. The alpha BL antibodies described here should prove to be useful in the investigation of B cell differentiation and in the clinical diagnosis of lymphoid neoplasms.","['Wang, C Y', 'Azzo, W', 'Al-Katib, A', 'Chiorazzi, N', 'Knowles, D M 2nd']","['Wang CY', 'Azzo W', 'Al-Katib A', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Knowles DM 2nd']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (rosette-inhibiting factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Blood Proteins/physiology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', '*Lipoproteins, LDL', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Complement/physiology', 'Receptors, Fc/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/08/01 00:00,1984/08/01 00:01,['1984/08/01 00:00'],"['1984/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Aug;133(2):684-91.,,['A1-18321/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The factor, termed P cell-stimulating factor (PSF), was assayed by its ability to support the growth of murine factor-dependent hemopoietic cell lines operationally termed persisting cells (P cells). PSF was purified 50,000-fold from serum-free medium conditioned by the myelomonocytic cell line WEHI-3B by sequential ammonium sulfate precipitation, phenyl boronate chromatography, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, neuraminidase treatment, Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C18 silica column, and two steps of high performance gel permeation chromatography on a TSK 3000 SW column operated under first neutral and then acidic solvent conditions. Although purified PSF could not be detected on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels stained with silver, following electrophoresis of purified PSF labeled with iodine-125, autoradiography showed only a single broad band of Mr = 30,000. This labeled band corresponded to the profile of PSF activity eluted from polyacrylamide gel slices. After reduction, labeled PSF had a slightly higher Mr of 32,000, although reduction resulted in loss of 98% of PSF activity, thus suggesting that the integrity of internal disulfide bond(s) was required for activity. When purified PSF was chromatographed on a TSK 3000 SW column under denaturing conditions in 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, the single peak of absorbance at 280 nm coincided with a sharp peak of biological activity. The following unique NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified PSF was obtained: NH2ALA -SER-Ile-Ser-X-X-Asp-Thr-His-Arg-Leu-Thr-Arg-. The concentration of PSF required for half-maximal stimulation of P cell growth was estimated as 1.3 X 10(-13) M or 4 pg/ml. The availability of purified PSF will allow rigorous examination of the hypothesis that a single molecule acts on multiple hemopoietic cell lineages.","['Clark-Lewis, I', 'Kent, S B', 'Schrader, J W']","['Clark-Lewis I', 'Kent SB', 'Schrader JW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight']",1984/06/25 00:00,1984/06/25 00:01,['1984/06/25 00:00'],"['1984/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1984/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 Jun 25;259(12):7488-94.,['S0021-9258(17)42817-1 [pii]'],['AI-03958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

The immunoglobulin isotype produced by the mature plasma cell is determined by a site specific process of gene switching which proceeds from mu to alpha production.

EHDP had no antitumor activity against the L1210 leukemia implanted i.p. and against sarcoma 180, Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) and Walker 256/B carcinoma injected i.p., s.c. or i.m. respectively. EHDP did not interfere with the antitumor activity of commonly used conventional chemotherapeutic agents (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, bis-chloroethylnitrosourea) in the L1210 and 3LL models. EHDP reduced proportionally to the dose the hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria due to the Walker 256/B carcinoma growth. In an effort to evaluate whether EHDP-treated osseous tissues were more refractory to tumor growth, cells from sarcoma 180 and 3LL carcinoma were implanted intratibially (i.t.). Growth of 3LL cells was not consistently affected by EHDP, whereas a modest, but significant, growth inhibition was consistently observed with sarcoma 180 injected i.t. Growth of sarcoma 180 implanted i.p. or s.c. was not reduced by this drug, thus suggesting that inhibition of i.t. sarcoma 180 was in fact related to alterations of osseous tissues by EHDP. Inoculation of Walker 256/B carcinoma intra-aortically resulted in osteolytic bone lesions in the hind limbs. EHDP inhibited the formation of bone metastasis under these conditions.","['Guaitani, A', 'Polentarutti, N', 'Filippeschi, S', 'Marmonti, L', 'Corti, F', 'Italia, C', 'Coccioli, G', 'Donelli, M G', 'Mantovani, A', 'Garattini, S']","['Guaitani A', 'Polentarutti N', 'Filippeschi S', 'Marmonti L', 'Corti F', 'Italia C', 'Coccioli G', 'Donelli MG', 'Mantovani A', 'Garattini S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M2F465ROXU (Etidronic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/secondary', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/drug therapy', 'Etidronic Acid/*therapeutic use', 'Hypercalcemia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/complications/*drug therapy', 'Osteolysis/drug therapy', 'Rats', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1984 May;20(5):685-93. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(84)90017-8.,['10.1016/0277-5379(84)90017-8 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

NK cell numbers were quantitated in burn patients using the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated monoclonal antibody Leu-7 and an Ortho cell sorter. NK activity of burn patients was only 30% of control levels. Thus, at a 50:1 effector:target cell ratio, burn patients' PBL gave a mean of 18% killing as compared to 60% killing mediated by control PBL (14 individuals). Pretreatment of PBL with interferon-gamma or interferon-alpha enhanced NK activity of normal PBL but had no effect on the NK activity of PBL from burn patients. The number of cells bearing antigen recognized by Leu-7 was variable in burn patients, with some patients having decreased (less than 5%), normal (8-10%), or elevated (20-40%) numbers of Leu-7 bearing PBL. No differences were observed in the total numbers of PBL in burn patients when compared to control individuals. These results indicate that NK activity does not correlate with the percentage of Leu-7 bearing cells present in PBL and that the inability of thermal injury patients to mediate normal NK function may contribute to their susceptibilities to viral infections.","['Stein, M D', 'Gamble, D N', 'Klimpel, K D', 'Herndon, D N', 'Klimpel, G R']","['Stein MD', 'Gamble DN', 'Klimpel KD', 'Herndon DN', 'Klimpel GR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Burns/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Reference Values']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1984 Jul;86(2):551-6. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(84)90412-x.,"['0008-8749(84)90412-X [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(84)90412-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Intestinal function abnormalities were greater in children whose methotrexate treatments were separated by 7 day than by 16 day intervals. Only five (19%) children had no abnormal tests. Abnormalities of small bowel function may be treatment induced and this has implications for morbidity from gastrointestinal symptoms, impairment of the mucosal barrier, and malabsorption of both nutrients and drugs leading to malnutrition and suboptimal drug concentrations.","['Pearson, A D', 'Craft, A W', 'Pledger, J V', 'Eastham, E J', 'Laker, M F', 'Pearson, G L']","['Pearson AD', 'Craft AW', 'Pledger JV', 'Eastham EJ', 'Laker MF', 'Pearson GL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['3OWL53L36A (Mannitol)', '4618-18-2 (Lactulose)', 'A1TA934AKO (Xylose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Absorption/*drug effects', 'Intestine, Small/*metabolism', 'Lactose Intolerance/chemically induced', 'Lactulose/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mannitol/metabolism', 'Xylose/blood']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1984 May;59(5):460-5. doi: 10.1136/adc.59.5.460.,['10.1136/adc.59.5.460 [doi]'],,PMC1628499,,,,,,,,,,

MCCA , or similar branched-chain fatty acids, may be useful in the treatment of human leukemia, particularly in combination with other differentiation-inducing drugs.","['Fischkoff, S A', 'Walter, E Jr']","['Fischkoff SA', 'Walter E Jr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,"['0 (Anticonvulsants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids)', '1123-25-7 (1-methylcyclohexanecarboxylic acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)']",IM,"['Anticonvulsants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Neutrophils/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",1984/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1984;3(2):132-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the fact that leukemic cells with lower spontaneous SCE rates need a further increase of SCE to reach values equal to those of normal cells might indicate a somewhat higher susceptibility of leukemic cells to DNA damage by MMC.

The substituent electronegativity factor sigma was statistically insignificant in determining potency, despite the good correlation of sigma p with the polarographic quinone-reduction potential.

Negative control by the Fv-1 locus in AKR mice of responder H-2b haplotype.,2665-71,"To assess whether the presence of a responder H-2b haplotype would be sufficient to allow mice of nonresponder ""high leukemic"" phenotype to generate syngeneic anti-AKR/Gross virus cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL), the AKR.H-2b strain was examined. Although capable of mounting vigorous apparent anti-minor histocompatibility-specific CTL responses, AKR.H-2b mice failed to produce anti-viral CTL after a variety of stimulation protocols. In contrast, the ""doubly congenic"" AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b strain was able to respond with substantial levels of H-2-restricted anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL activity. These results indicated that Fv-1n alleles could exert negative epistatic control over responder H-2b-encoded gene(s). Because the B6.Fv-1n congenic was also able to generate anti-viral CTL indistinguishable from the prototype B6 strain, however, it was apparent that other genes of AKR background were required for the Fv-1n-mediated inhibition in AKR.H-2b mice. The mechanism by which Fv-1 intereacted with other genes to override positive H-2b control appeared to be related to the expression of the CTL-defined, virus-associated antigens by normal AKR.H-2b cells. Thus, AKR.H-2b spleen cells but not thymus cells were able to stimulate the production of B6 anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL and were recognized as target cells by such anti-viral CTL. In contrast, both spleen cells and thymocytes from AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b mice were negative when tested as stimulator or target cells in these assays. In addition, AKR.H-2b but not AKR.H-2b:Fv-1b spleen cells were shown to display serologically defined gp70 determinants and the Gross cell surface antigen. Taking these data together, it appeared that the inhibition of anti-viral CTL responsiveness might be due to tolerance induced by the cell surface expression of virus-associated antigens by normal AKR.H-2b cells.

H-2-encoded dominant gene control.,2658-64,"Previously, a system was devised whereby H-2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be raised that were specific for tumors induced by endogenous AKR/Gross murine leukemia virus and that displayed the Gross cell surface antigen (GCSA). The generation of such anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL required in vivo priming with allogeneic (H-2 and/or non-H-2 incompatible) GCSA+ tumor cells, followed by in vitro restimulation with H-2-compatible GCSA+ tumor cells. The prototype responder strain of mice was C57BL/6, which is of the H-2b type and which has a low incidence of spontaneous virus-induced leukemia (""low leukemic""). Present experimentation indicates that there is H-2-encoded control of the ability to mount an anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL response. In addition to C57BL/6, all other H-2b strains tested, including C57BL/10, C57L, and 129, were responders. In contrast, H-2k strains of both ""high leukemic"" (AKR) and ""low leukemic"" (AKR.Fv-1b and CBA) phenotype appeared to be low- or nonresponders with respect to their ability to generate H-2k-restricted anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL after appropriate stimulation. Furthermore, B6.H-2k congenic mice were also poorly responsive, suggesting that H-2b and H-2k were responder and nonresponder haplotypes, respectively. The finding that (responder X nonresponder)F1, i.e., (B6 X CBA)F1 mice mounted CTL responses to H-2b, but not H-2k, GCSA+ tumors, was consistent with this interpretation and suggested the presence of H-2-encoded dominant immune response genes. The tumors of AKR background that were efficient in the in vivo priming of C57BL/6 mice were relatively inefficient in priming (B6 X CBA)F1 mice for a subsequent in vitro H-2b-restricted anti-AKR/Gross virus CTL response. Because of the similarities in background minor H genes of the AKR and CBA strains, this latter observation was in keeping with the requirement for in vivo stimulation with tumor cell alloantigens in addition to the virus-associated target antigens.","['Green, W R']",['Green WR'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Genes, Dominant', '*Genes, MHC Class II', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics/immunology', 'Haploidy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1984/05/01 00:00,1984/05/01 00:01,['1984/05/01 00:00'],"['1984/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 May;132(5):2658-64.,,"['CA-27552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The ability of recombinant DNA-derived interferons (IFN) and a number of myeloid differentiating agents to induce re-expression of class I HLA antigens and beta-2-m was therefore studied. All three classes (alpha, beta, and gamma) of IFN were capable of re-inducing HLA and beta-2-m, although gamma-IFN was more potent. Of a variety of chemical differentiating agents, only 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) was found to induce HLA class I antigens.

Methylthioribose was shown to dramatically affect these cells, increasing their growth rate, saturation density, and viability. It was also found that methylthioribose could satisfy the methylthio dependence of the enzyme-deficient cell line, L1210D. A model is proposed to explain the selective growth of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase-deficient cells in medium lacking a methylthio donor but containing fetal calf serum. It is hypothesized that cellularly exported methylthioadenosine is degraded to methylthioribose in the presence of medium containing serum of high methylthioadenosine phosphorylase activity (i.e. fetal calf serum). The resultant methylthioribose can then be used to satisfy the methylthio requirement of these cells. To test this theory, various purified preparations of bovine liver methylthioadenosine phosphorylase were used to artificially increase the specific activity of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase in horse serum. In each case, it was demonstrated that only medium containing serum of enzyme activity nearly equal to that of the glutathione-stimulated fetal calf serum activity, supported the growth of methylthio-dependent cells in the absence of methylthio compounds. The data suggest that the degradation of methylthioadenosine and subsequent formation of methylthioribose represents an essential process in the growth of mammalian cells.","['Riscoe, M K', 'Ferro, A J']","['Riscoe MK', 'Ferro AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Thioglycosides)', '23656-67-9 (5-methylthioribose)', 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Glutathione/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*physiopathology', 'Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Thioglycosides/*toxicity']",1984/05/10 00:00,1984/05/10 00:01,['1984/05/10 00:00'],"['1984/05/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/05/10 00:01 [medline]', '1984/05/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1984 May 10;259(9):5465-71.,['S0021-9258(18)91034-3 [pii]'],"['CA 00617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies, however, have demonstrated that the polyamines are essential for proliferation, but not differentiation, of HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells.

However, in contrast to previous studies, we have also demonstrated that induction of HL-60 differentiation with dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, butyric acid, or retinoic acid is inhibited by alpha-difluoromethyl ornithine (DFMO) depletion of intracellular putrescine and spermidine. Further, the addition of exogenous spermidine abrogates DFMO inhibition of HL-60 differentiation, thus confirming the involvement of this polyamine in the expression of a differentiated phenotype. The discrepancy between our results and those of previous studies probably stems from the nearly complete, rather than partial, depletion of intracellular spermidine achieved in the present work.

Erythroid differentiation was induced indirectly by fusing Friend cells that had been exposed briefly to dimethyl sulfoxide prior to fusion with nonerythroid cells that had been treated with ultraviolet light(or other DNA-damaging agents). The results suggest that two distinct reactions are involved in erythroid differentiation in Friend cells in vitro. One reaction, originating from the damaged DNA (or inhibition of DNA replication as a consequence), exhibits an inducible nature, is nonspecific to Friend cells, and is trans-acting. The other reaction is specific to Friend cells. Evidence that a typical tumor promoter, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate, inhibits erythroid differentiation by affecting the latter reaction is also presented. Brief exposure of Friend cells to DMSO was found to induce an early cellular activity required fusion for erythroid differentiation which is detected only by with UV irradiated cells. The induction process of this activity consists of at least two distinct stages. In the first stage, the reaction proceeds without supply of metabolites from the medium and exhibits sensitivity to tumor promoters. The second stage is closed involved with cellular metabolic activity, notably protein synthesis. Under normal conditions, the induced activity is short-lived, suggesting that turnover of the molecules responsible for this activity. There appears to be a signal produced following DMSO pulse which acts as an inducer for this activity. The signal remains active as long as 40 hr when protein synthesis is blocked. When permeabilized Friend cells, which had been briefly treated by DMSO, were exposed to cell-free extracts from UV irradiated cells, a small but significant number of the cells became reactive to benzidine, a characteristic of erythroid differentiation. The activity in the extracts was apparently induced following UV irradiation, reaching a maximum 25 to 30 hr after irradiation. After partial purification, the active factor seems to be a protein with a molecular weight of 35,000 to 40,000.","['Oishi, M']",['Oishi M'],['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Most of plasmacytomas showed the specific translocations of chromosomes between either No. 12 and No. 15 or No. 6 and No. 15. These chromosome translocations were common to all plasmacytomas induced by different agents.

Such a germ-free environment, inside and out, can be achieved in laboratory animals after considerable manipulation, including delivery by cesarean section. This is rarely indicated or achieved in humans, but investigators have tried to decrease the numbers of organisms on the outside of patients (both environmental and on the skin) and to do the same with the inside--or at least to selectively decrease the organisms most likely to invade from mucous membranes and the gastrointestinal tract. Most studies of protected environments have included patients who receive prophylactic oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, prophylactic systemic antibiotics, or oral absorbable antibiotics (selective decontamination). Another variable that needs to be considered is the use of sterile food--included in some studies, not used in others, and not mentioned in still others. No studies have used the only appropriate control, which is the same laminar airflow room, but with the airflow turned off and without gowns, masks, or gloves, only assiduous hand-washing. The same staff should care for the control patients as well as those in protected environments. In addition, control patients in some studies have been clearly different in the severity of the underlying disease from patients placed in protected environments. Even without these proper controls, differences in infection rates have varied considerably among the studies both inside and outside the protected environment and efficacy has also varied considerably; however, the one constant in almost every controlled study is that life has not been prolonged, remission induction increased, nor remission duration prolonged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Armstrong, D']",['Armstrong D'],['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Environment, Controlled', 'Europe', 'Humans', '*Infection Control', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Patient Isolation/economics/psychology', 'United States']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1984 Apr;76(4):685-9. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90295-x.,"['0002-9343(84)90295-X [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(84)90295-x [doi]']",,,10,,,,,,,,,

The hematocrit level stabilized with a decrease in red blood cell destruction by intravenous immunoglobulin G in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with AIHA without altering red blood cell autoantibody titers, but severe hemolysis recurred after 21 days. A long-term remission was observed when intravenous immunoglobulin G was combined with steroids, chemotherapy, plasmapheresis, and splenectomy. The platelet count increased and platelet transfusion requirement was eliminated in a chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient with immune thrombocytopenic purpura by the intravenous immunoglobulin G, and chemotherapy was administered and a complete remission resulted. An interesting observation was the lymphocytopenic effects observed in the five patients during a daily infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin for five days. Furthermore, the maintenance intravenous immunoglobulin G given every three weeks controlled both infections and lymphocyte counts with the chemotherapy. Changing the schedule to every four weeks resulted in poor control of the lymphocyte counts with chemotherapy. These observations indicate a direct macrophage blocking effect in autoimmune hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenic purpura, but the lymphocytopenic effect suggests immunomodulating effects of intravenous immunoglobulin G, which may alter the response of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to chemotherapy.","['Besa, E C']",['Besa EC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/blood/etiology/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Infusions, Parenteral/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic/blood/etiology/therapy']",1984/03/30 00:00,1984/03/30 00:01,['1984/03/30 00:00'],"['1984/03/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/30 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1984 Mar 30;76(3A):209-18. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90344-9.,"['0002-9343(84)90344-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(84)90344-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

A particular feature of HTA 1 is the presence in significant amounts of an additional beta 2m-like subunit, called beta t (refs 3, 4). Top facilitate biochemical studies we have prepared a high HTA 1 expressor variant (NH17) of the human thymoma line MOLT-4.

Further, beta t was present when the cells were grown in medium containing fetal calf serum (FCS), but absent from cells grown with human serum (HuS). We show here that addition of human and bovine beta 2m to MOLT-4 and NH17 cells grown in serum-free medium produces a significant elevation of HTA 1 antigen expression, providing evidence for a regulatory or stabilizing function for the exchange of extracellular beta 2m with a cell-surface antigen.","['Kefford, R F', 'Calabi, F', 'Fearnley, I M', 'Burrone, O R', 'Milstein, C']","['Kefford RF', 'Calabi F', 'Fearnley IM', 'Burrone OR', 'Milstein C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (beta 2 microglobulin receptor)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'HLA Antigens/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*immunology']",1984/04/12 00:00,1984/04/12 00:01,['1984/04/12 00:00'],"['1984/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/12 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1984 Apr 12-18;308(5960):641-2. doi: 10.1038/308641a0.,['10.1038/308641a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These findings have major implications when we consider both the ontogenesis of these leukemic cells and the normal differentiation of human lymphocytes.","['Ha, K', 'Minden, M', 'Hozumi, N', 'Gelfand, E W']","['Ha K', 'Minden M', 'Hozumi N', 'Gelfand EW']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/pathology']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1984 Apr;73(4):1232-6. doi: 10.1172/JCI111310.,['10.1172/JCI111310 [doi]'],,PMC425138,,,,,,,,,,

In calf serum supplemented Dulbecco's medium (CS-DMEM), 1.2 mM UDPgalactose (UDPgal) inhibited cell growth by 50% (IC50), and 5 mM UDPgalactose inhibited cell growth by 92%. Other nucleotide sugars as well as galactose, glucose, and galactose-1-phosphate had little or no effect on cell growth. Uridine nucleotides, which inhibit galactosyltransferase activity, protected L1210 cells from the growth inhibitory effect of UDPgalactose when both were added simultaneously to culture media. Unlike mouse 3T12 cells, in which no inhibition of cell growth was observed with heat-inactivated calf serum (HICS)-DMEM, 5 mM UDPgalactose inhibited L1210 cell growth in HICS-DMEM to the same degree as that observed in CS-DMEM. In contrast to 3T12 cells, L1210 cells secrete significant galactosyltransferase activity into the media. Complete inhibition of 3T12 cell growth by UDPgal was observed if HICS-DMEM medium was first conditioned by L1210 cells for 48 hours. No difference in cell growth or [3H]thymidine uptake was detected after 6 hours of exposure to UDPgalactose, but both were significantly decreased at 24 and 48 hours. Flow cytometric analysis of UDPgalactose effects on L1210 cells revealed no differences in the distribution of cells in G1, S, or G2-M of the cell cycle after 6 hours of incubation, but after 16 hours of UDPgalactose treatment, L1210 cells were arrested in early S phase. These cells were completely viable and morphologically similar to control L1210 cells. Normal growth was resumed when UDPgal was removed. The data suggest that UDPgalactose inhibition of cell growth requires extracellular galactosyltransferase activity and that the effect is mediated via the cell membrane.","['Klohs, W D', 'Wilson, J R', 'Weiser, M M', 'Frankfurt, O', 'Bernacki, R J']","['Klohs WD', 'Wilson JR', 'Weiser MM', 'Frankfurt O', 'Bernacki RJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Uridine Diphosphate Sugars)', '2956-16-3 (Uridine Diphosphate Galactose)', '58-98-0 (Uridine Diphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'V50K1D7P4Y (Uridine Diphosphate Glucose)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Galactosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Uridine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Uridine Diphosphate Galactose/*pharmacology', 'Uridine Diphosphate Glucose/pharmacology', 'Uridine Diphosphate Sugars/*pharmacology']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1984 Apr;119(1):23-8. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041190105.,['10.1002/jcp.1041190105 [doi]'],"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We have monitored the relationship of intracellular polyamine levels with proliferation and differentiation of murine Friend erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. The ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, alpha-difluoromethylornithine, has been used to inhibit MEL proliferation by depleting intracellular putrescine and spermidine. This inhibition of MEL proliferation is abrogated by exogenous putrescine, spermidine, or spermine. The measurement of intracellular polyamine levels following the addition of these exogenous polyamines demonstrates that spermidine is required for MEL proliferation. Further, we have found a highly significant relationship (p less than 0.0001) between intracellular spermidine levels and MEL proliferation. The results also demonstrate that spermidine is required for induction of MEL differentiation by dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylene bisacetamide, and butyric acid. Moreover, there is a highly significant relationship (p less than 0.0001) between MEL proliferation and differentiation. The present study thus suggests that spermidine is involved in cell proliferation and, thereby, differentiation of MEL cells.","['Sugiura, M', 'Shafman, T', 'Kufe, D']","['Sugiura M', 'Shafman T', 'Kufe D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'Q3JTX2Q7TU (Diazepam)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Diazepam/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Eflornithine', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Ornithine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism', 'Spermine/metabolism']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1984 Apr;44(4):1440-4.,,"['CA 19589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Benign and malignant lymphoid cells were investigated for their reactivity with these antibodies in cell suspension by indirect immunofluorescence and in cryostat tissue sections by the avidin-biotin complex immunoperoxidase technique. Fetal liver pre-B cells and pre-B and common type acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells isolated from 15 patients were OKB1-OKB2+OKB4-OKB7-. All mature lymphoid tissue B cells and the neoplastic cell surface immunoglobulin-positive (SIg+) B cells isolated from each of 47 B cell neoplasms were OKB2+. OKB1 and OKB7 were expressed by interfollicular, follicular center, and many, but not all, mantle zone B cells. OKB4 was expressed by follicular center cells, but not by mantle zone or interfollicular B cells. The neoplastic SIg+ B cells isolated from 45 of 47 B cell malignancies were OKB1+OKB4+, and those isolated from 45 of 46 B cell malignancies were OKB7+. The neoplastic B cells of one mantle zone lymphoma were OKB1-, of one small lymphocytic cell lymphoma were OKB7-, of one large cell lymphoma were OKB4-, and of one small lymphocytic cell lymphoma with a monoclonal gammopathy were OKB1-OKB4-. Normal and myeloma plasma cells were OKB-. The malignant T cells isolated from 12 T cell neoplasms were OKB2-OKB4-, but were OKB1+ and/or OKB7+ in 3 cases. Thus, the OKB antibodies appear to detect distinctive antigens that may be expressed at different stages of B cell differentiation. In addition, OKB4 reacted with selected renal and respiratory epithelium, and OKB2 reacted with a wide range of epithelial tissues. The OKB antibodies should prove useful in the investigation of B cell differentiation and may aid in the identification and characterization of lymphoproliferative malignancies with significant therapeutic and prognostic differences not identifiable by conventional histopathologic and immunologic methods.","['Knowles, D M 2nd', 'Tolidjian, B', 'Marboe, C C', 'Mittler, R S', 'Talle, M A', 'Goldstein, G']","['Knowles DM 2nd', 'Tolidjian B', 'Marboe CC', 'Mittler RS', 'Talle MA', 'Goldstein G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fetus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubules/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",1984/04/01 00:00,1984/04/01 00:01,['1984/04/01 00:00'],"['1984/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1984 Apr;63(4):886-96.,['S0006-4971(20)85556-6 [pii]'],"['CA24679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY03357/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The viruses were obtained from the thymuses and spleens of preleukemic and leukemic animals and were evaluated for dualtropism and oncogenicity. All these isolates induced cytopathic foci on mink cells but could be classified into two groups based on their relative infectivities for SC-1 (mouse) or mink (ATCC CCL64) cells. One group of Friend MCFs (F-MCFs) (group I) exhibited approximately equal infectivities for SC-1 and mink cells, whereas a second group (group II) infected mink cells 1,000- to 10,000-fold more efficiently than SC-1 cells. Structural analyses of the F-MCFs revealed that group I and group II viruses correlated with recombination of Friend murine leukemia virus with two distinct, but closely related, endogenous NFS proviral sequences. No correlation was found between the type of F-MCF and the tissue of origin or the disease state of the animal. Furthermore, none of the F-MCF isolates were found to be oncogenic in NFS/N or AKR/J mice. F-MCFs of both groups underwent extensive substitution of ecotropic sequences, involving much of the gag and env genes of group I F-MCFs and most of the gag, pol, and env genes of group II F-MCFs. All F-MCF isolates retained the 3' terminal U3 region of Friend murine leukemia virus. Comparison of the RNAs of the F-MCFs with RNAs of MCFs derived from NFS.Akv-1 or NFS.Akv-2 mice indicated that the F-MCFs were derived from NFS proviral sequences which are distinct from the sequences contained in NFS.Akv MCF isolates. This result suggested that recombination with particular endogenous proviral sequences to generate MCFs may be highly specific for a given murine leukemia virus.","['Evans, L H', 'Cloyd, M W']","['Evans LH', 'Cloyd MW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', 'EC 3.1.27.3 (Ribonuclease T1)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Genes, Viral', 'Oligonucleotides/analysis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Ribonuclease T1/metabolism']",1984/03/01 00:00,1984/03/01 00:01,['1984/03/01 00:00'],"['1984/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1984 Mar;49(3):772-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.49.3.772-781.1984.,['10.1128/JVI.49.3.772-781.1984 [doi]'],,PMC255537,,,,,,,,,,

The cleavage is at internucleosomal sites, apparently through activation of an endogenous endonuclease. In variants of the cell lines selected for resistance to glucocorticoid, neither apoptosis nor chromatin cleavage were observed after steroid treatment, and steroid receptors were undetectable. In thymocytes, both the morphological changes of apoptosis and chromatin cleavage were inhibited by cycloheximide and actinomycin D. The calcium-magnesium ionophore A23187 induced apoptosis and chromatin cleavage in thymocytes, and these effects were also inhibited by cycloheximide. The data confirm that the condensed chromatin which characterizes apoptosis morphologically consists of endogenously digested chromatin fragments. They also provide support for the view that at least some cells enter apoptosis by a process dependent upon macromolecular synthesis.","['Wyllie, A H', 'Morris, R G', 'Smith, A L', 'Dunlop, D']","['Wyllie AH', 'Morris RG', 'Smith AL', 'Dunlop D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '5GMR90S4KN (Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatin/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone Hemisuccinate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Thymus Gland/drug effects/ultrastructure']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1984 Jan;142(1):67-77. doi: 10.1002/path.1711420112.,['10.1002/path.1711420112 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the first step, the cells were incubated with endo-beta-galactosidase to selectively expose terminal N-acetylglucosamine residues of the lactosamine backbone to the chains. In the second step these residues were glycosylated by incubation with galactosyltransferase and radioactive UDP-galactose. As many as 2.5-3.0 X 10(6) residues per cell could be transferred to human erythrocytes. Negligible amounts of labeling occurred if either of the enzymes was omitted from the incubations. Of the label 80% was found in glycoproteins. In accordance with previous observations, bands 3 and 4.5 were found to be the main carriers of polyglycosyl chains. In human promyelotic HL-60 leukemia cells, a major band of apparent molecular weight of 110000-140000 was labeled. In addition, bands of lower molecular weight which appear to have escaped detection by previous methods were also labeled. The novel labeling method was found to be simple to perform, uses commercially available reagents, and leads to the efficient and highly specific labeling of cell surface molecules carrying polyglycosyl chains.","['Viitala, J', 'Finne, J']","['Viitala J', 'Finne J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Galactosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.1.103 (keratan-sulfate endo-1,4-beta-galactosidase)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/*analysis', '*Galactosidases', '*Galactosyltransferases', 'Glycolipids/*blood', 'Glycoproteins/*blood', '*Glycoside Hydrolases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Polysaccharides/*blood', '*beta-Galactosidase']",1984/01/16 00:00,1984/01/16 00:01,['1984/01/16 00:00'],"['1984/01/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/16 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1984 Jan 16;138(2):393-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb07928.x.,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1984.tb07928.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacteria were identified by their FITC-fluorescence and discriminated from the leukocyte cell nuclei by the much higher EB fluorescence and lower coefficient of variation of the latter. Following phagocytosis, both the bacterial FITC- and EB-fluorescence decayed. The mean FITC-fluorescence was reduced about 20% after 15 min and 30-50% after 60 min. Zymosan particles were labeled by FITC and incubated with leukocytes for 15 min. Phagocytes were sorted by FCM and the zymosan particles were liberated by sonication. Their forward angle light scatter was reduced by about 50.6 +/- 2.1% and the FITC-fluorescence by 8.7 +/- 1.0% (mean +/- SD). The reduced FITC-fluorescence and light scatter suggests degradation of proteins, and the decay of EB-fluorescence degradation of DNA, but the specificity remains to be established. By this method phagocytes from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus seemed to have a selective defect in DNA degradation, whereas phagocytes from a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia had a low capacity to degrade bacterial proteins.

I. In vitro cytotoxicity.",70-6,"A new synthetic tripeptide (p-F-Phe-m-bis-(2-chloroethyl)amino-Phe-Met ethoxy HCl), PTT.119, was demonstrated to have significant cancericidal activity against seven in vitro tumor cell lines of different origins and etiologies and against primary human AMML, ALL, and hairy cell leukemias. Viabilities of each murine tumor and rabbit, marmoset, and human leukemia and lymphoma line were significantly reduced by treatment with 1-50 micrograms PTT.119 in media containing serum. Continuous 24-h exposure or pulse treatment as short as 15 and 30 min with the tripeptide resulted in irreversible damage to the tumor cells. Under identical treatment conditions, freshly isolated human leukemic cells, particularly ALL lymphoblasts, were even more susceptible to PTT.119 than any of the tested tumor cell models. Examination of the parameters of PTT.119 activity revealed that reductions of tumor cell survival were dependent on the concentration of the tripeptide. Prolongation of PTT.119 exposure from 15 min to 24 h increased the rates of tumor cell death but did not proportionally reduce the numbers of surviving cells. Assessment of tumor cell viabilities for 5 consecutive days following pulse exposure to PTT.119 demonstrated increasing reductions in tumor cell survival, which were greatest 5 days after treatment of PTT.119 was compared with its three parental components either as individual agents or as a mixture. Both the alkylator moiety, m-sarcolysin (m.L.SL) alone or together with p-fluoro-phenylalanine and L-methionine ethoxy HCl, and L-PAM (L-phenylalanine and L-methionine ethoxy HCl, and L-PAM (L-phenylalanine mustard), the p-isomer of m.L.SL, were 1,5- to 3-fold less cytotoxic to L1210 leukemia and MJY-alpha mammary tumor cells than PTT.119.

Our studies demonstrate that immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and rearrangements between these genes and the c-myc oncogene are accompanied by dramatic differences in their temporal order of replication.

Therapy for BMT consisted of high-dose, short-term chemotherapy either alone (Group I) or in combination with single-dose irradiation, total lymphoid (Group II) or total body (Group III). Subjects in Group III had all received combination chemotherapy prior to BMT. Hormonal and clinical evidence of germ-cell dysfunction was common in that 6 patients manifested elevated plasma levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and four subjects were found to have a subnormal testicular volume. Of the six patients with abnormal FSH values, four were followed serially, and all showed normalization over time. Leydig cell function was less impaired in that seven of the eight patients produced normal adult male levels of testosterone, including three subjects with elevated luteinizing hormone (LH) levels.

Hairy cell leukemia cells did not express either monocyte antigens (M1 and MO2) or the antigens expressed by early (J5) and intermediate (B2) B cells or plasmacytoid lymphocytes and plasma cells (T10). These immunohistochemical results with monoclonal antibodies provide further evidence that hairy cell leukemia is characterized by a combination of antigens peculiar to mature B lymphocytes.","['Tubbs, R R', 'Savage, R A', 'Sebek, B A', 'Fishleder, A', 'Weick, J K']","['Tubbs RR', 'Savage RA', 'Sebek BA', 'Fishleder A', 'Weick JK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Spleen/*immunology/pathology']",1984/02/01 00:00,1984/02/01 00:01,['1984/02/01 00:00'],"['1984/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1984 Feb;76(2):199-205. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(84)90774-5.,"['0002-9343(84)90774-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(84)90774-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The Hemalog D differential counter was used in the diagnosis and follow-up of hairy cell leukemia. The percentage of large unstained cells (LUC) closely correlated with the percentage of hairy cells. However, there was a highly reproducible rapid decrease in LUC during the period of time after collection of the blood, when potassium EDTA was used as an anticoagulant. This ""loss"" in LUC could not be attributed to a selective disappearance of hairy cells, but to a shift into the lymphocyte box. The steep decline did not occur when sodium EDTA was used.

The average overall cost per patient was $18,760, and increased over the period of study. Increased total hospital costs were incurred by patients who achieved a favorable response to induction chemotherapy and by those with a diagnosis of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). To assess the impact of successful treatment on hospital expenditures, total months of survival were compared with total hospital costs to determine cost per month of life. Using this analysis, improved survival, favorable response to chemotherapy, and a diagnosis of ALL were associated with significant decreases in cost per month of life. The long-term survivors (alive greater than or equal to 2 years from diagnosis) best demonstrated this effect, with a mean hospital cost per month of survival from diagnosis of $563, which was significantly less than $6,937 for those who achieved a partial remission, $10,703 for those with treatment failure, and $8,240 for those who were untreated. These costs linked to outcome are comparable to those reported in other disorders that require prolonged and intensive hospital care.

However, it is not clear whether IFN production is essential for NK cells to lyse their target cells in vitro, especially in long-term (greater than 18 hrs) assays. To investigate this, 0.5 X 10(6) normal mouse spleen cells were cocultured in RPMI 1640 medium with Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLD-3) (1 X 10(4] for 24 hours under conditions which cause lysis of FLD-3 cells. Supernatant fluid from such cultures demonstrated antiviral activity (100-200 units) which could be identified as IFN-gamma. Prior filtration of spleen cells over nylon wool, and pretreatment with anti-Thy-1.2 + C' abrogated their ability to generate IFN-gamma without affecting their NK (FLD-3) activity. The IFN-gamma producing cell which could also be detected in spleens of nu/nu BALB/c mice lacked cell surface, Lyt-1, Lyt-2, and NK-1.2 antigens. The stimulus for IFN-gamma induction appeared to be Mycoplasma arginini carried in the FLD-3 tumor cells. Although mycoplasma-free FLD-3 cells failed to induce IFN in vitro, they retained their susceptibility to NK cell-mediated lysis. We conclude that IFN induction is not essential for NK(FLD-3) cell-mediated lysis; indeed IFN detected in NK cell assays may be produced in response to mycoplasma infection of the tumor cells. The Thy-1.2 positive cells stimulated by mycoplasma to produce IFN-gamma lack several characteristics of T-cells or NK cells.","['Kumar, V', 'Lust, J', 'Gifaldi, A', 'Bennett, M', 'Sonnenfeld, G']","['Kumar V', 'Lust J', 'Gifaldi A', 'Bennett M', 'Sonnenfeld G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mycoplasma/*immunology', 'Species Specificity', 'Spleen/immunology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1983 Dec;165(5):445-58. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(83)80068-0.,"['S0171-2985(83)80068-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(83)80068-0 [doi]']","['AI-18811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NASA: 84110315'],,,,

Children required PN most often for failure to thrive and adults for stomatitis. There was no significant difference in frequency or duration of PN among 24 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia randomized to receive cyclosporine or methotrexate therapy and among 28 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia randomized to interferon or no interferon.

Trigger of the lethal hit event is distinct for NK/K and LDCC effector cells as measured in the two-target conjugate assay.,199-207,"Normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) express several in vitro cytotoxic functions, among which are natural killer (NK), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC). The relationship of these various cytotoxic functions and the identity of cells involved has been a subject of controversy. Recently it was reported that NK and K for ADCC can be mediated by the same cell, suggesting that they constitute in large part a single subpopulation with multiple cytotoxic functions. The ability of this NK/K effector cell to mediate LDCC was examined here using the two target conjugate assay. The effector cells were Ficoll-Hypaque PBL or LGL-enriched fractions. The targets used were K562 or MOLT for NK, RAJI coated with antibody for ADCC, and RAJI coated with PHA or Con A or modified by NaIO4 for LDCC. In the two-target conjugate assay, one of the targets is fluorescein labeled for identification. The results show that (a) LDCC copurifies with NK/K and is enriched in the LGL fraction, as measured in both the 51Cr-release assay and the single-cell assay for cytotoxicity; (b) single effector cells simultaneously bind to NK or ADCC and LDCC targets, revealing that single cells bear binding receptors for all targets; and (c) single lymphocytes were not able to kill both bound NK/K and LDCC targets. However, significant two-target killing was obtained when both targets were NK targets, ADCC targets, LDCC targets, or one NK and one ADCC target. These results demonstrate that the NK and LDCC effector cells are distinct subpopulations copurified in the LGL fraction. In addition, the results show that lectin is unable to trigger globally an NK effector cell to mediate cytotoxicity against a bound NK insensitive target. Thus, although both NK and LDCC effector cells are present in the LGL fraction and can bind to both types of targets, the trigger of the lethal hit event is the function of specialized effector cells.","['Bradley, T P', 'Bonavida, B']","['Bradley TP', 'Bonavida B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,,IM,"['*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1984 Jan;83(1):199-207. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(84)90239-9.,"['0008-8749(84)90239-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(84)90239-9 [doi]']","['AI-7126/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-12800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma), a T cell product, can regulate macrophage HLA-DR expression. The effect of absolutely pure or cloned IFN-gamma upon fetal monocytes that do not strongly express DR has not been studied. We have utilized cloned IFN-gamma, IFN-beta, and IFN-alpha preparations to examine the differential effects of these molecules upon the expression of HLA class I (HLA-A,B) and class II determinants by fetal monocytes as well as by myeloid leukemic cell lines. We report that cloned human IFN-gamma induces the expression of HLA-DR and -A,B antigens on cells that normally express low quantities of these molecules, including human fetal monocytes and two (ML-1 and HL-60) but not a third (U-937) myeloid leukemic cell lines. These findings suggest that the acquisition of class II HLA molecules upon fetal tissues and perhaps antigen presenting function is dependent upon IFN-gamma. In contrast, IFN-beta and -alpha induced the expression of HLA-A,B but not HLA-DR antigens by these cells. Thus, these data indicate that the expression of HLA-DR molecules that is vital for monocyte/macrophage and T cell interaction is stimulated by the lymphokine IFN-gamma, and that the effects of IFN-gamma are distinctive from IFN-alpha or -beta.","['Kelley, V E', 'Fiers, W', 'Strom, T B']","['Kelley VE', 'Fiers W', 'Strom TB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1984 Jan;132(1):240-5.,,"['AM 21094/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AM 30805/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The 6- and 2',6'-proton chemical shifts of bound trimethoprim have been determined by transfer of saturation experiments, and the 2-carbon chemical shift has been determined by using [2-13C]trimethoprim. The changes in proton chemical shift are substantially smaller than those accompanying binding to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase [Cayley, P. J., Albrand, J. P., Feeney, J., Robert, G. C. K., Piper, E. A., & Burgen, A. S. V. (1979) Biochemistry 18, 3886]. It is shown that this difference arises largely from the fact that trimethoprim adopts different conformations when bound to mammalian and to bacterial dihydrofolate reductase. The proton chemical shifts are interpreted in terms of ring-current contributions from the two aromatic rings of trimethoprim itself and the nearby aromatic amino acid residues of the enzyme. The latter have been located by using the refined crystallographic coordinates of the Lactobacillus casei and Escherichia coli reductases in their complexes with methotrexate [Bolin, J.

The results were compared with an unirradiated control group. Basal and peak testosterone values after 1000 units of HCG were significantly lower in the irradiated patients than in the control group. Peak follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) values after 100 micrograms LHRH were significantly higher in irradiated boys, but there was no difference in either basal FSH or basal and peak luteinising hormone values. The findings suggest that the ability of the Leydig cell to produce testosterone--as detected by the HCG test--is appreciably reduced after irradiation and that tubular dysfunction in prepubertal boys may sometimes be predicted by a raised FSH response.","['Leiper, A D', 'Grant, D B', 'Chessells, J M']","['Leiper AD', 'Grant DB', 'Chessells JM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9002-68-0 (Follicle Stimulating Hormone)']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone/blood', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/physiopathology/*radiotherapy', 'Leydig Cells/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Testis/physiopathology/*radiation effects', 'Testosterone/blood/metabolism']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1983 Nov;58(11):906-10. doi: 10.1136/adc.58.11.906.,['10.1136/adc.58.11.906 [doi]'],,PMC1628384,,,,,,,,,,

The observed number of DR homozygotes among the patients was twice the expected value in families where the parents shared a B and a DR antigen. Segregation analysis of the shared antigens disclosed significant prevalence of heterozygotes among the healthy siblings, which suggested the occurrence of gametic selection in such families. This study indicates that mating of certain shared alleles of the HLA system (especially of the DR locus) is associated with a risk for the offspring to develop ALL in childhood.

From such a PSF-dependent line, we report the emergence of variants that had concomitantly acquired both the capacity for autonomous growth in the absence of exogenous PSF and the capacity for the autogenous production of PSF. The link between these two new properties was strengthened by the demonstration that the variant lines absorbed PSF and, in some culture conditions, responded to exogenous PSF. Thus when variant cells were plated at low density in 1-ml agar cultures, cloning efficiency and colony size were enhanced by supplementation with sources of PSF, including medium conditioned by concanavalin A-stimulated normal spleen cells, T-cell tumors and T-cell hybridomas, and, importantly, medium conditioned by the autonomous P-cell lines themselves. In contrast to the parental line, the autonomous clones tested formed progressively growing tumors in vivo. It is proposed that the myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B that produces PSF arose from a neutrophil-macrophage progenitor through acquisition of the capacity for the autogenous production of PSF and that the autogenous production of PSF may play a similar role in a range of proliferative disorders both of the blood and of other tissues containing components derived from the bone marrow.","['Schrader, J W', 'Crapper, R M']","['Schrader JW', 'Crapper RM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Genetic Variation', 'Growth Substances/*genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1983 Nov;80(22):6892-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.80.22.6892.,['10.1073/pnas.80.22.6892 [doi]'],,PMC390092,,,,,,,,,,

Six CLL patients were included in our series; one manifested monoclonal IgM in the serum. The Id determinants of M protein was detected on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm of pathologic cells in the peripheral blood. Eight of ten WM patients were examined for SmIg; all had monoclonal SmIg on the surface of cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow.

Surface immunoglobulin (sIg) and B1 antigen proved to be the most useful markers for B-cell lineage. Six major subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) of non-T cell nature are now recognized by these immunological techniques, including null-ALL, Ia-ALL, lymphoid stem cell ALL, pre-pre-B ALL, pre-B ALL and B-ALL. In cases of chronic leukemias and lymphomas of non-T cell nature, 80% of the tumor was defined by sIg and 88% by B1 antigen as definitely of B-cell lineage. The clonal character was also defined in 68% of the tumor on the basis of the detection of predominant single light chain in sIg. Ia-like antigen was detected in almost all cases (96%). Leukemic cells from all cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), chronic lymphosarcoma cell leukemia (CLsCL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) reacted with OKIa1 and anti-B1, and leukemic cells from most of them with anti-pan T monoclonal antibody (10.2). In more than half of CLL and CLsCL, leukemic cells were reactive with J5, OKM1, 9.6 and OKT8, but not with OKT3, OKT4 and OKT6. HCL cells had almost the same reactivity with these monoclonal antibodies as CLL and CLsCL cells except that J5 remained unreactive. These results indicated that Japanese CLL, CLsCL and HCL were different from Western ones at least with respect to surface marker characteristics. In cases of lymphomas, heavy chains of sIg were expressed in polyclonal fashion, especially in follicular lymphoma and diffuse lymphomas of medium sized cell type and large cell type, indicating that lymphomas of these types may originate from follicular center cells of the heavy chain switching stage. Anti-T monoclonals were also reactive with lymphoma cells. In about half of follicular lymphomas and diffuse lymphomas of the medium sized cell type, lymphoma cells reacted with 10.2, and less frequently with 9.6, OKT4 and OKT3. On the other hand, only in one or two cases of diffuse lymphoma of the large cell type and of immunoblastic sarcoma (IBS), did tumor cells react with 10.2 and 9.6, but this was exceptional. In more than 25% of IBS, tumor cells also reacted with OKT8, but not with OKT4 and OKT3. These results indicated that anti-T monoclonals are no longer specific for T-cell lineage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Shimoyama, M', 'Minato, K', 'Tobinai, K', 'Nagai, M', 'Hirose, M']","['Shimoyama M', 'Minato K', 'Tobinai K', 'Nagai M', 'Hirose M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1983 Sep;13(3):477-88.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we show that immature myeloid cells from normal bone marrow or the peripheral blood of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia can be induced to differentiate to monocyte-like cells by immune gamma interferon (IFN gamma). We have identified IFN gamma as the predominant differentiation factor contained in the conditioned medium. Purified or recombinant IFN gamma, but not various preparations of IFN alpha or beta, can induce monocytic differentiation in myeloid cells. In cultures containing conditioned medium, the cells fail to continue myeloid maturation, and are induced to express monocyte markers and functions, such as monocyte-specific surface antigens, HLA-DR antigens, Fc receptors for monomeric immunoglobulins, nonspecific esterase, and the ability to mediate antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Even myeloid cells as mature as metamyelocytes or band cells can be induced by IFN gamma to undergo monocyte differentiation, but monocyte-specific or HLA-DR antigens are not induced in mature neutrophils. These findings reveal a previously unknown, specific function of human IFN gamma and offer new insights to the regulation of monocyte recruitment and differentiation during a virus infection or immune response.","['Perussia, B', 'Dayton, E T', 'Fanning, V', 'Thiagarajan, P', 'Hoxie, J', 'Trinchieri, G']","['Perussia B', 'Dayton ET', 'Fanning V', 'Thiagarajan P', 'Hoxie J', 'Trinchieri G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monocytes/immunology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Dec 1;158(6):2058-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.158.6.2058.,['10.1084/jem.158.6.2058 [doi]'],"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20833/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187172,,,,,,,,,,

Intracellular distribution of J and mu chains in leukemic HLA-DR+ null and pre-B cells, and in normal B cells stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) was determined by immunoelectron microscopy and radioimmunoassay (RIA). J chain was detected in leukemic null and pre-B cells on free and membrane-bound ribosomes in the cytoplasm, or on perinuclear cisternae. Mu chain was found on free ribosomes and ribosomal clusters in leukemic pre-B cells but was absent in the leukemic null cells. In pre-B cell lines, mu chain was seen within rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and the Golgi apparatus whereas J chain was not detected in these organelles. However, both mu and J chain were detected in RER and the Golgi apparatus of immature and mature plasma cells induced by PWM stimulation of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Low levels of J chain were also detected by RIA in lysates of leukemic null and pre-B cells. Most of the intracellular J chain became detectable after reduction and alkylation of cell lysates, and free J chain was not found in the culture supernatants. The amount of intracellular and secreted immunoglobulin-bound J chain increased dramatically after PWM stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes. The majority of J chain-positive cells seen over an 8 d culture interval were lymphocytes and lymphoblasts, while mu chain was found primarily in plasma cells. These results suggest that J chain expression precedes mu chain synthesis during B cell differentiation and that a combination of the two chains for secretion is not initiated until the onset of plasma cells maturation.","['Hajdu, I', 'Moldoveanu, Z', 'Cooper, M D', 'Mestecky, J']","['Hajdu I', 'Moldoveanu Z', 'Cooper MD', 'Mestecky J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/ultrastructure', 'Golgi Apparatus/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/*analysis', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Ribosomes/analysis']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Dec 1;158(6):1993-2006. doi: 10.1084/jem.158.6.1993.,['10.1084/jem.158.6.1993 [doi]'],"['AI-10854/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05349/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2187181,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, anti-light chain idiotypes were raised against monoclonal light chains from the urine of four patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The antibodies reacted specifically with the tumor cells of the homologous patient, assessed by immunofluorescence, and can therefore be used for tumor cell detection. In one case for which serum idiotypic IgM was available, the anti-light chain idiotype was shown to bind whole idiotypic IgM, and such binding could be inhibited by idiotypic IgM or idiotypic light chains, which demonstrates recognition of similar antigenic determinants. The binding of antibody to tumor cells was also totally inhibited by idiotypic IgM. The analysis of separated sera from the four patients for free light chains demonstrated only low levels (3.0 to 8.6 micrograms/ml of serum with a mean of 5.8), which suggests that light chain is rapidly cleared and therefore does not present a major barrier to antibody attack.

Effect of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate, a potent inhibitor of aspartate transcarbamylase.",13564-9,"The activity of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway has been measured in resistant and sensitive murine tumors in vivo following a single intraperitoneal dose of N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA) (400 mg/kg). For these studies, we utilized a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometric technique which enabled measurement of 13C incorporation from 13CO2 into the uracil nucleotide pool (sigma uracil) of tumors in situ. Flux through the de novo pathway was 75-85% inhibited 1 h after PALA treatment in both sensitive (Lewis lung carcinoma) and the resistant (L1210) tumors, but there was a lag time before this inhibition was reflected in reduced sigma uracil pools. The activity of the pathway in the Lewis lung carcinoma tumors remained maximally depressed (5-15% of control activity) for up to 48 h after the dose of PALA. In contrast, flux through the pathway of L1210 tumors remained 80% inhibited for up to 4 h following PALA administration, but recovered to 70% of control activity between 4 and 12 h after PALA treatment. Recovery of the remaining 30% of control activity in the L1210 tumor was at a much slower rate requiring between 12 and 48 h after PALA treatment to regain full activity of the pathway. This recovery of flux through the de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway did not correlate with the measurement of recovery of aspartate transcarbamylase activity in similarly treated tumors. These data argue strongly in favor of the importance of the de novo biosynthetic pathway, rather than salvage mechanisms, for determining in vivo sensitivity or resistance of these tumors to PALA treatment.","['Monks, A', 'Anderson, L W', 'Strong, J', 'Cysyk, R L']","['Monks A', 'Anderson LW', 'Strong J', 'Cysyk RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '78QVZ7RG8L (sparfosic acid)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Aspartic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carbon Dioxide/blood/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Oxygen/blood', 'Phosphonoacetic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*biosynthesis']",1983/11/25 00:00,1983/11/25 00:01,['1983/11/25 00:00'],"['1983/11/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/25 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1983 Nov 25;258(22):13564-9.,['S0021-9258(17)43951-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of globotriaosylceramide and a galactosyltransferase.,633-44,"This study was to find out whether induction of special glycolipids or glycosyltransferases for glycolipid synthesis which might be involved in the cell functions occurred during the differentiation. Mouse myeloid leukemia cell line (M1-), the differentiated cells (M1+), and a subcloned cell line (Mm1) were used for this purpose. Gangliotriaosylceramide (GA2) was the major glycolipid component in M1- cells. As a result of differentiation of M1- into M1+ cells, globotriaosylceramide (CTH) was newly induced as the main glycolipid, while GA2 decreased to a minor component. GA2 was found to be the main glycolipid in Mm1 cells but no CTH was recognized. All precursor glycolipids and glycosyltransferases required to complete the biosynthetic pathway glucosylceramide (CMH) leads to lactosylceramide (CDH) leads to GA2 leads to gangliotetraosylceramide (GA1) leads to sialosylgangliotetraosylceramide (GM1b) were found in M1- and also in Mm1 cells. A galactosyltransferase activity for CTH synthesis from CDH increased 10 fold during the differentiation. The induction of CTH in M1+ cells could be attributed to the increase of the galactosyltransferase activity. Both CTH as a surface marker and the galactosyltransferase as an enzyme marker are proposed as valuable markers of differentiation in M1- cells. Besides the galactosyltransferase, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferease involved in the formation of lactotriaosylceramide (amino-CTH) increased up to 3 fold during the differentiation. The increase of the enzyme activity seemed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of lactoneotetraosylceramide (paragloboside) which appeared in M1+ cells.","['Taki, T', 'Kawamoto, M', 'Seto, H', 'Noro, N', 'Masuda, T', 'Kannagi, R', 'Matsumoto, M']","['Taki T', 'Kawamoto M', 'Seto H', 'Noro N', 'Masuda T', 'Kannagi R', 'Matsumoto M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Globosides)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Trihexosylceramides)', '71965-57-6 (globotriaosylceramide)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbohydrate Conformation', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Galactosyltransferases/*genetics', 'Globosides/*genetics', 'Glycolipids/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Glycosphingolipids/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*physiopathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', '*Trihexosylceramides']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 1983 Sep;94(3):633-44. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134403.,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a134403 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We found among the parents of affected children a highly significant increased compatibility at the DR locus (p = 0.003). A similar increase was observed in sharing HLA antigens of the B locus (p = 0.02). The observed number of homozygotes among the patients was twice the expected value in families where the parents shared a B and a DR antigen. In segregation analysis, heterozygotes for the shared parental HLA antigen were significantly more prevalent among the healthy siblings. Our genetical analysis indicates that mating of certain shared alleles of the HLA system (especially of the DR locus) is associated with the risk for the offspring to develop ALL in childhood. This situation favors the expression of recessive genes associated with the MHC, and presumably those involved in the susceptibility to acute leukemia. Because familial leukemia is a rare event, the susceptibility to childhood ALL must also implicate genes outside the MHC and important environmental factors.","['Von Fliedner, V E', 'Merica, H', 'Jeannet, M', 'Barras, C', 'Feldges, A', 'Imbach, P', 'Wyss, M']","['Von Fliedner VE', 'Merica H', 'Jeannet M', 'Barras C', 'Feldges A', 'Imbach P', 'Wyss M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Child', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class II', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genetic Linkage', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Male', 'Probability']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1983 Nov;8(3):183-93. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(83)90036-8.,"['0198-8859(83)90036-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(83)90036-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparisons of the monoclonal antibody anti-Tac, which recognizes the IL-2 receptor, to B1.49.9 suggest that B1.49.9 also recognizes a structure similar or identical to the IL-2 receptor.","['Hemler, M E', 'Malissen, B', 'Rebai, N', 'Liabeuf, A', 'Mawas, C', 'Kourilsky, F M', 'Strominger, J L']","['Hemler ME', 'Malissen B', 'Rebai N', 'Liabeuf A', 'Mawas C', 'Kourilsky FM', 'Strominger JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Hum Immunol,Human immunology,8010936,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/analysis/*immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Immunol. 1983 Oct;8(2):153-65. doi: 10.1016/0198-8859(83)90010-1.,"['0198-8859(83)90010-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0198-8859(83)90010-1 [doi]']","['1F32-AI06484-01/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 15669/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

AML cell membranes and ML-1 human myeloblast cell line membranes have exceptionally high fucosyltransferase A activity compared to all other leukemic cells or cell lines. Human leukemic B cell lines expressed cell membrane sialyltransferase, fucosyltransferase B and probably fucosyltransferase A activity several times higher than T cell lines.

Both sialyltransferase and galactosyltransferase activity were higher in all leukemic cells than in normal leukocytes and PHA-stimulated normal lymphocytes.

These results indicate that all glycosyltransferase activity, with the exception of fucosyltransferase activity in CLL, were higher in leukemic cells than in normal cells. Moreover, large differences in these enzymes, e.g. very high galactosyltransferase activity in myeloid cell lines compared to B and T cell lines, of fucosyltransferase A in AML and myeloblast cell lines compared to all other cells, and of sialyltransferase in B-CLL or B cell lines compared to T-CLL or T cell lines, could be useful in characterizing certain leukemias and hematopoietic cell lines.","['Rossowski, W', 'Srivastava, B I']","['Rossowski W', 'Srivastava BI']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,"['EC 2.- (Transferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Galactosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Hexosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Fucosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Galactosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Hexosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Transferases/*metabolism']",1983/10/01 00:00,1983/10/01 00:01,['1983/10/01 00:00'],"['1983/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1983 Oct;19(10):1431-7. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(93)90013-u.,['10.1016/0277-5379(93)90013-u [doi]'],"['CA-13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

In Southern blots, only one or two rearranged mu chain genes are seen, suggesting that a clonal event leading to blast crisis can occur in a committed B cell precursor rather than in the multipotential stem cell precursor, in which the Ph1 chromosome originated.

Both agents decreased X-ray break production, and this decrease was comparable in magnitude to the degree of inhibition of X-ray-induced cell killing. By contrast, Me2SO increased the DNA breaks produced by the intercalators, Adriamycin, 5-iminodaunorubicin, and 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide. This was not due to an enhancement of Adriamycin or 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide uptake by Me2SO. Strand break production by intercalators was decreased by thiourea. This was not due to an inactivation of the intercalators or to a decrease of Adriamycin or 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide uptake by thiourea. Experiments using nucleoid sedimentation to assess the DNA linking number and domain size from cells treated with Me2SO and thiourea indicated that these chemicals alter chromatin structure in a fashion which may account for effects on intercalator-induced DNA scission.

The neoplastic lymphoid cells in the skin infiltrate differed morphologically and immunologically from those in the peripheral blood. The occurrence of CTCL during this patient's clinical course represents a second neoplasm arising from a different cell line, rather than a tissue manifestation of the patient's CLL. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which the occurrence of CTCL is documented in a patient with immunologically known B-cell CLL. In addition to establishing the presence of B-cell CLL and CTCL of the helper/inducer T-cell type in the same patient, this case report demonstrates the usefulness and necessity of evaluating lymphoproliferative disorders by means of a multidisciplinary approach.","['Sheibani, K', 'Forman, S J', 'Winberg, C D', 'Rappaport, H']","['Sheibani K', 'Forman SJ', 'Winberg CD', 'Rappaport H']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/complications/*immunology/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1983 Dec;62(6):1176-81.,['S0006-4971(20)63303-1 [pii]'],"['CA 09308/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphokine is cytostatic and induces expression of Fc receptors in U937 and in myelomonocytic leukemic lines RC-2A and KG-1, but does not have these effects on T- and B-lymphocytic lines. In addition to previously described properties, including complement receptors, phagocytosis, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), Mac-1 and Mac-3 surface antigens defined by monoclonal antibodies are induced on U937 cells by lymphokine and phorbol ester. The Mac-1 surface component appears to have a regulatory role in differentiation of the monocyte lineage line, since antibodies to this antigen block the induction of Mac-3 antigen. The lymphokine activity was concentrated by salt precipitation and characterized by ion-exchange and size chromatography. Fractions of about 40,000 daltons were responsible for growth inhibition and induction of Fc receptors and Mac-1 antigen in U937 cells. However, ADCC was not induced in U937 by individual fractions of lymphokine, suggesting that this cytotoxic capacity may be regulated by a lymphokine of a different size, which is only effective after initial maturation steps. Since gamma-interferon is present on the 40K size range of lymphokine, the possibility that interferon is a differentiation modulator for the monoblast cells was investigated. Highly purified gamma-interferon (10(7) U/mg protein) at 10-300 U/ml inhibited growth and induced Fc receptors in U937 similar to the effect of lymphokine. The Fc-receptor-inducing activity of lymphokine was inhibited by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to gamma-interferon, suggesting that this differentiation factor in lymphokine is gamma-interferon.","['Ralph, P', 'Harris, P E', 'Punjabi, C J', 'Welte, K', 'Litcofsky, P B', 'Ho, M K', 'Rubin, B Y', 'Moore, M A', 'Springer, T A']","['Ralph P', 'Harris PE', 'Punjabi CJ', 'Welte K', 'Litcofsky PB', 'Ho MK', 'Rubin BY', 'Moore MA', 'Springer TA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/physiology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology/pathology', 'Glycoproteins/physiology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/*physiology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphokines/isolation & purification/*physiology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/biosynthesis']",1983/12/01 00:00,1983/12/01 00:01,['1983/12/01 00:00'],"['1983/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1983 Dec;62(6):1169-75.,['S0006-4971(20)63302-X [pii]'],"['AI-15811/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-17920/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31799/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In blocking studies IgM complexes and IgM aggregates appear to detect the same receptor and with both reagents binding is influenced by the presence of Mg2+ but not Ca2+ and is inhibited by EDTA. The percentage of cells binding EAB was highest in normal B lymphocyte fractions enriched for C2+ cells (CRL+). EAB binding to cells in the CRL- fractions was negligible even though CRL- fractions contained cells which were SmIg+C-3. EAB bound only to neoplastic chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (CLL) that expressed a high percentage of C+3 cells. Clones lacking a C3 receptor failed to bind EAB. Thus, the binding of EAB complexes to B lymphocytes appears to be associated principally with a subset that express a C3 receptor whereas IgM aggregates bind to the entire SmIg+ B cell population.","['Rudders, R A', 'Andersen, J']","['Rudders RA', 'Andersen J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

The series III analogues, which excluded the hydroxymethyl group and replaced the oxodithioacetal moiety of sparsomycin with a benzyl amide group, were designed to investigate the potential interaction of an amide oxygen in contrast to the sulfoxide oxygen of sparsomycin. Overall, the bromobenzyl-substituted analogues imparted the greatest inhibitory activity in the protein synthesis assay, while the methoxybenzyl-substituted analogues displayed the least. The methylbenzyl and the unsubstituted benzyl compounds were intermediate in inhibitory potential. The activity in the protein synthesis assay may correspond to the lipophilic and electronic characteristics of the substituents on the benzyl moiety of the analogues. All of the compounds were inactive in the DNA synthesis assay.","['Duke, S S', 'Boots, M R']","['Duke SS', 'Boots MR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '6C940P63E7 (Sparsomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis', 'Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Sparsomycin/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1983/11/01 00:00,1983/11/01 00:01,['1983/11/01 00:00'],"['1983/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1983 Nov;26(11):1556-61. doi: 10.1021/jm00365a003.,['10.1021/jm00365a003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells treated with another granulocytic differentiator, retinoic acid, also had higher 2-deoxyglucose decarboxylation activity, and contained less ST, more FT, and more NGT activities than untreated cells.

The antigens recognized by antibodies 20.2 and 20.3 are expressed by all cells of the monocyte lineage in both peripheral blood and bone marrow. Cell-sorting experiments demonstrated that histiocytes and immature bone marrow cells with detectable alpha-naphthyl butyrate esterase activity also express both antigens. Within cells of other lineages, the antigens had distinct patterns of expression. Immature myeloid cells were 20.2 negative, but 20.3 positive; whereas mature myeloid cells were 20.2 positive, but 20.3 negative. Nucleated erythroid cells and platelets expressed only the 20.3 antigen. These results indicate that myeloid and monocytic cells share common differentiation antigens with cells of the erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages.

Because immunoglobulin heavy-chain and light-chain genes must undergo a DNA rearrangement during B-cell development but rarely do so in human non-B-cell lineages, we examined these genes in 18 episodes of chronic myelogenous leukemia. In eight of nine episodes of lymphoid blast crisis, heavy-chain genes were rearranged, and in three, rearrangements in light-chain genes were also present. In contrast, cells from chronic myeloid, myeloid blast, and erythroid-like phases retained germ-like immunoglobulin genes. The observed phenotypic markers and gene configurations revealed that most lymphoid blast crises represent stages of development of B-cell precursors. In two separate episodes of lymphoid crisis, cells from a single patient possessed identical heavy-chain but different light-chain-gene configurations.

The present report describes the GTGO procedure, a modification of the TAO technique introduced by Murakami et al. (1977, 1978), which we have found successful for the preparation of air dried peripheral blood leucocytes for SEM studies. Air dried, GTGO-treated leucocytes show excellent preservation of surface features with minimal cell shrinkage.

FACS analysis revealed that Ab 188 bound to the majority of peripheral T lymphocytes of strain 2 and strain 13 guinea pigs and to a minor population of thymocytes. It failed to react with the Ia-bearing guinea pig B cell leukemia line EN-L2C, with macrophages, bone marrow cells, erythrocytes, or thrombocytes. Treatment of T cells with Ab 188 and complement prevented T cell activation. Culturing primed T cells with antigen- or mitogen-pulsed syngeneic or with allogeneic macrophages in the continuous presence of Ab 188 produced a marked, dose-dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation. The antigen defined by Ab 188 was therefore designated guinea pig T lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, gp TFA-1. The magnitude of inhibition by Ab 188 varied between 65 and 85% whereas three other antibodies to guinea pig T cells had no inhibitory effect on T cell proliferation. Time course experiments revealed that gp TFA-1 is critically involved in an early phase of T cell activation. Maximal inhibition was achieved only if the antibody was present from the beginning of the cell culture; the addition of antibody after 24 hr of culture no longer had an inhibitory effect. Ab 188 did not induce T cell mitogenesis. Two-dimensional analysis (one-dimensional, IEF; two-dimensional, SDS-PAGE) of immunoprecipitates obtained from NP40 lysates of [35S]methionine-labeled T cell blasts indicated that a molecule was specifically precipitated that consisted of two noncovalently associated polypeptide chains with apparent m.w. of 43,000 and 38,000. Both subunits displayed extensive charge heterogeneity focusing at an average isoelectric point of 5.0 and 6.5, respectively. The gp TFA-1 molecule exhibits striking similarities in its functional and structural properties to recently described clonotypically expressed T cell glycoproteins, which were shown to be involved in antigen recognition by T cells in the murine and human systems.","['Burger, R', 'Reske, K', 'Mauer, U', 'von Steldern, D', 'Husmann, M']","['Burger R', 'Reske K', 'Mauer U', 'von Steldern D', 'Husmann M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Guinea Pigs/*immunology', 'Isoantigens/immunology', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1983/09/01 00:00,1983/09/01 00:01,['1983/09/01 00:00'],"['1983/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Sep;131(3):1350-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequencies of seropositive macaques ranged from 10 to 50%. In three macaque species (Japanese monkeys, rhesus monkeys, and crab-eating monkeys) in which sufficient numbers of animals were studied, more females than males were anti-ATLA positive and the antibody-positive rate increased with age. In Japanese monkeys, over 70% were seropositive after the age of 10 years. A family study of Japanese monkeys suggested maternal transmission of ATLV or a closely related agent. These seroepidemiological features are consistent with those of Japanese in the ATL-endemic area. Three of 10 rhesus monkeys were found to be anti-ATLA-positive 13 days after arrival in Japan, suggesting that they had been infected with ATLV in Indonesia where they were captured.

We have investigated the in vivo production of IL-3 in mice rendered leukaemic with WEHI-3b cells and mice stimulated by acute graft versus host disease (GVHD). In leukaemic mice, IL-3 was not found in serum or sonicates of 18-day spleens or bone marrow, although cells from the leukaemic organs were fully competent to elaborate IL-3 in vitro. Further, elaboration of IL-3 by WEHI cells in vitro was not affected by co-culture with normal haemopoietic cells. However, intracellular IL-3 was detected in leukaemic nodules isolated from the liver. Inhibitors specific for IL-3 were not found, although liver-cell conditioned medium and leukaemic nodule sonicates contained potent non-specific inhibitors of cell growth. At 21 days, intracellular IL-3 was also present in spleens and correlated with the presence of non-specific inhibitors. In GVHD, no evidence for IL-3 elaboration in vivo was found, nor did lymphoid populations affected by GVHD spontaneously elaborate it in vitro; however, their competence to produce it was unaffected, as IL-3 was elaborated on subsequent mitogen stimulation in vitro. We also investigated the recovery and circulation of in vitro 111Indium-labelled IL-3 dependent cells after injection in vivo and the half-life of semi-purified IL-3. Dependent cells were not recovered after injection into irradiated recipients, although the cells recirculated for at least 24 hours. Inability to recover dependent cells was explicable on general cytotoxicity which masked potential recovery. The serum half-life of injected partially purified material with IL-3 activity was short (less than 30 min). We conclude that the elaboration of IL-3 by leukaemic WEHI-3b is not an in vitro artifact and these results are discussed in relationship to other growth factors and the leukaemic state, and the origin of IL-3 dependent lines.","['Garland, J M', 'Aldridge, A', 'Wagstaffe, J', 'Dexter, T M']","['Garland JM', 'Aldridge A', 'Wagstaffe J', 'Dexter TM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'Half-Life', 'Interleukin-3', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/immunology']",1983/08/01 00:00,1983/08/01 00:01,['1983/08/01 00:00'],"['1983/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1983 Aug;48(2):247-59. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1983.180.,['10.1038/bjc.1983.180 [doi]'],,PMC2011446,,,,,,,,,,

Role of the enzyme in the metabolism and antineoplastic action of adenine-substituted analogs of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine.,1907-16,"The biological activities of several previously synthesized [J. A. Montgomery et al., J. med. Chem. 17, 1197 (1974)] adenine-substituted analogs of 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthio- or 5'-deoxy-5'-ethyl-thioadenosine, including the 2-fluoroadenine, 2-chloroadenine, 2,6-diaminopurine, 8-azaadenine, and 4-aminopyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine-containing derivatives, have been reexamined. It is demonstrated that many of these analogs are cleaved to their respective free base analogs by 5'-deoxy-5'-methyl-thioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAPase), an enzyme associated with polyamine biosynthesis, and that this reaction is necessary for the cytotoxic action of these MTA analogs to be fully expressed. Evidence to support this includes: (1) the growth of two MTAPase-containing human colon carcinoma cell lines (the HCT-15 and DLD-1 lines) was inhibited by these analogs, whereas an MTAPase-deficient cell line, the CCRF-CEM human T-cell leukemia, was relatively insensitive to their cytotoxic action; (2) extracts of the MTAPase-containing colon carcinoma cell lines were able to cleave these analogs to their respective free base analogs; in contrast, extracts of MTAPase-deficient CCRF-CEM cells were unable to cleave these analogs; (3) intact colon carcinoma cells converted these MTA analogs to their corresponding 5'-phosphorylated analog nucleotides, whereas CCRF-CEM cells did not, at least to detectable levels; and (4) the MTA analog, 5'-deoxy-5'-ethylthio-4-aminopyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine ribonucleoside, which is not a substrate of MTAPase, did not form analog nucleotides and was essentially noncytotoxic to all cell lines tested, whereas the corresponding adenine analog, 4-aminopyrazolo [3,4-d]pyrimidine, readily formed analog nucleotides and was highly cytotoxic to all the lines. It is postulated that the corresponding adenine analog 5'-phosphorylated nucleotides are the primary active metabolites of these MTA analogs, having been formed by the cleavage of these nucleosides to free adenine analogs by MTAPase, followed by the conversion of these base analogs to analog nucleotides by adenine phosphoribosyltransferase and the enzymes of adenine nucleotide phosphorylation. This pathway represents a novel drug-activation system for the synthesis of analog nucleotides and has the potential to be exploited chemotherapeutically.","['Savarese, T M', 'Dexter, D L', 'Parks, R E Jr']","['Savarese TM', 'Dexter DL', 'Parks RE Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Colonic Neoplasms/enzymology', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/enzymology', 'Pentosyltransferases/*physiology', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency/*physiology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1983/06/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/06/15 00:00'],"['1983/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1983 Jun 15;32(12):1907-16. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(83)90057-6.,"['0006-2952(83)90057-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(83)90057-6 [doi]']","['CA 07340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20892/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments carried out with the combination of difluoromethylornithine and aminoguanidine, a potent inhibitor of diamine oxidase (EC 1.4.3.6), indicated that the methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone)-induced reversal of polyamine depletion was mediated by the known inhibition of diamine oxidase by the diguanidine.

Surface Ig was analyzed using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter under carefully controlled conditions. The cells from all patients with CLL were monoclonal with respect to light chain type. Those patients with IgM as the brightest heavy chain class (suggesting relatively immature B cells) had clinically advanced stages of CLL, whereas those with a predominance of IgG (suggesting more mature cells) have a lesser stage of CLL.

B-cell lineage differentiation is accompanied by two types of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements--rearrangement of V, D and J gene segments to create a functional V gene and rearrangement of CH genes for heavy-chain switching. These results, however, have been obtained mainly by analysis of immunoglobulin gene organization of myeloma cells. Baltimore and his colleagues have established Abelson murine leukaemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed cell lines and found a few lines capable of carrying out kappa-gene rearrangement or undergoing isotype switching during in vitro culture. To study early B-cell lineage differentiation events, we have now also established A-MuLV-transformed cell lines which are capable of differentiating from mu- to mu+ and of undergoing continuing rearrangement of heavy-chain genes in culture. Analysis of immunoglobulin gene organization of these transformed cells revealed that mu- cells have already undergone DNA rearrangements involving JH segments but an additional rearrangement of JH segments is required for initiation of mu-chain synthesis. Southern blot analysis of the DNA and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of intracytoplasmic mu-chain show that mu-chain diversity with respect to antigen specificity may be generated during this second rearrangement process. As no rearrangement of light-chain genes takes place in these cells, this implies that light-chain gene rearrangement requires some further change, or a different enzyme.","['Sugiyama, H', 'Akira, S', 'Kikutani, H', 'Kishimoto, S', 'Yamamura, Y', 'Kishimoto, T']","['Sugiyama H', 'Akira S', 'Kikutani H', 'Kishimoto S', 'Yamamura Y', 'Kishimoto T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin mu-Chains)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin mu-Chains/genetics', 'Mice', '*Recombination, Genetic']",1983/06/30 00:00,1983/06/30 00:01,['1983/06/30 00:00'],"['1983/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1983 Jun 30;303(5920):812-5. doi: 10.1038/303812a0.,['10.1038/303812a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

With the use of a monoclonal antibody to B4, it was shown that B4 is present on B cells isolated from peripheral blood and lymphoid organs, on cell lines derived from normal and malignant B cells, and on tumor cells isolated from patients with B cell-derived neoplasms. B4, in contrast, was not detected on normal, activated, or malignant cells of T or myeloid origin. The B4 antigen is distinct from known B cell antigens, including sIg, Ia, B1, B2, Fc, and C3. Examination of mitogen-stimulated B lymphocytes suggests that the B4 antigen initially increases with B cell activation and then is lost at the terminal stage of B cell differentiation. Moreover, the observation that B4 is expressed on almost all early B cell tumors suggests that it may precede B1, CALLA, cytoplasmic mu, and B2 in early B cell ontogeny.","['Nadler, L M', 'Anderson, K C', 'Marti, G', 'Bates, M', 'Park, E', 'Daley, J F', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Nadler LM', 'Anderson KC', 'Marti G', 'Bates M', 'Park E', 'Daley JF', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis']",1983/07/01 00:00,1983/07/01 00:01,['1983/07/01 00:00'],"['1983/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1983 Jul;131(1):244-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the behaviour of plasma fibronectin and of factor VIII R:AG was investigated in acute leukaemia in order to prove their significance as prognostic and therapeutic markers (method: electroimmunoassay). In patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (n = 29) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 11) no significant changes in fibronectin concentration could be evaluated. Fibronectin levels declined significantly only during therapy with asparaginase in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, probably as a result of disturbed synthesis in the liver. Using crossed immunoelectrophoresis against fibronectin antiserum, one normal and one slower migrating antigen (FN:C) could be observed in nearly all plasma samples in patients with acute leukaemia. By means of in vitro tests with highly purified substances and intermediate gel electrophoresis it could be shown that FN:C represents fibronectin which has bound fibrinogen, probably crosslinked by activated factor XIII. Factor VIII R:AG was found to be greatly raised in patients with acute leukaemia--up to 1400% of the normal level. Increased levels correlated well with a worsening of the disease. The protein seems to be suitable for estimating the activity and prognosis of acute leukaemia.","['Klingemann, H G', 'Kosukavak, M', 'Hofeler, H', 'Havemann, K']","['Klingemann HG', 'Kosukavak M', 'Hofeler H', 'Havemann K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem,Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift fur physiologische Chemie,2985060R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (von Willebrand Factor)', '9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Factor VIII/analysis/*immunology', 'Fibronectins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Time Factors', 'von Willebrand Factor']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hoppe Seylers Z Physiol Chem. 1983 Mar;364(3):269-77. doi: 10.1515/bchm2.1983.364.1.269.,['10.1515/bchm2.1983.364.1.269 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Severe gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity have limited the use of HMM drug combinations in ovarian cancer. Combinations involving HMM, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and doxorubicin in advanced ovarian cancer have resulted in only moderate response rates, with little to no change in median survival of previously treated patients. HMM now is being studied in previously untreated patients with advanced disease, in combination with these agents. In lung cancer, HMM continues to be a part of intensive and other regimens for the treatment of small-cell and non-small-cell carcinoma, although the value of the HMM is yet to be determined. Future trials have been recommended to determine whether HMM has a role in the treatment of endometrial and prostatic carcinomas. Five phase I studies of PMM have demonstrated severe, dose-limiting gastrointestinal and central nervous system toxicities. Thus, this agent may offer little advantage over HMM. Further phase I studies, with different PMM dosage schedules, are necessary before phase II studies can be recommended.","['Hahn, D A']",['Hahn DA'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Drug Intell Clin Pharm,Drug intelligence & clinical pharmacy,0212457,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Triazines)', 'Q8BIH59O7H (Altretamine)', 'UEF6R96K8R (pentamethylmelamine)']",IM,"['Altretamine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Triazines/*therapeutic use']",1983/06/01 00:00,1983/06/01 00:01,['1983/06/01 00:00'],"['1983/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Intell Clin Pharm. 1983 Jun;17(6):418-24. doi: 10.1177/106002808301700602.,['10.1177/106002808301700602 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Application and findings in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,21-33,"The present study investigated the surface immunoglobulin (Ig) phenotypic pattern in 64 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The fluorescence activated cell sorter techniques were modified to provide sensitive and highly reproducible detection and quantification of the otherwise faint surface immunoglobulins on the cells in CLL. In over 98% of the cases of CLL, light chain of the surface Ig could be identified and measured. Serial measurements were shown to be highly reproducible. The phenotypic pattern and density identified on the surface of the circulating lymphocytes precisely reflected the findings in any given patient when other lymphoid tissue (bone marrow, lymph node or spleen) was sampled. Intraclonal heterogeneity detected by surface Ig was seen in some cases of CLL in spite of a relatively uniform morphology by other classical techniques. Three patterns of cell-to-cell variation were seen: 1) that of a non-Gaussian distribution of surface light Ig staining intensity 2) that of the presence of increased surface light Ig chain on a portion of the cells with a subpopulation of CLL cells showing an additional class of heavy chain, and 3) that of anisotropy where the surface Ig quantitatively did not correlate with cell size. Immunoglobulin phenotypic characterization of the cases of CLL was correlated with their clinical stage of disease activity. The distribution of surface light chain phenotype did not relate to any pattern of clinical stage of activity of the disease. By contrast, cases where the cells had a predominance of surface IgM were associated with a more advanced stage of CLL and a poorer clinical prognosis. When surface IgG was predominant, a lesser degree of clinical activity of disease was identified. The phenotypic pattern of the surface Ig on the lymphocytes in CLL mirrors the pattern of differentiation in the murine model of B-cell differentiation, and clinical aggressiveness appears to correlate with the character and degree of B-cell differentiation.","['Kettman, J R', 'Smith, R G', 'Uhr, J W', 'Vitetta, E S', 'Sheehan, R', 'Ligler, F S', 'Frenkel, E P']","['Kettman JR', 'Smith RG', 'Uhr JW', 'Vitetta ES', 'Sheehan R', 'Ligler FS', 'Frenkel EP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells. 1983;9(1):21-33.,,"['CA 18132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 22014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in fewer microbiologically documented infections (seven versus 15; p = 0.029). This was primarily the result of a reduction in episodes of bacteremia in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-treated group as compared with the placebo-treated group (three versus nine episodes; p = 0.05). The combined frequency of disseminated candidiasis, candidemia, and esophagitis of presumed fungal etiology was greater in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-treated group (six) than in the placebo-treated group (two) but not significantly so (p = 0.13). Similarly, there were no significant differences between groups in the overall incidence of infectious complications, number of febrile days, use of parenteral antibiotics, or number of days following randomization to first infectious episode.

More frequent emergence of yeast isolates from previously culture-negative patients was documented (p = 0.033). Thus, in this study, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis during granulocytopenia reduced the incidence of microbiologically documented infections.

Leukaemic T lymphocytes did not take less than 48 h to traverse the spleen. This result was different from that of normal subjects, in which T lymphocytes continue to fall up to 44 h after the initial rise. Liver activity was seen to accumulate progressively up to 68 h. This could be explained by the infiltration of the liver by T lymphocytes or phagocytosis of damaged T lymphocytes due to Kupffer cells. Leukaemic T lymphocytes entered the enlarged, inguinal lymph nodes at 3 h and left after 68 h, but few T lymphocytes crossed the axillary lymph nodes, which were enlarged as much as the inguinal lymph nodes.

The decreases in body weight, peripheral leukocyte and erythrocyte counts, and subsequent recovery following administration of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), an S-phase-specific cytotoxic agent, to animals receiving DFMO was comparable to those observed in animals which received ara-C alone.

A significant synergistic increase in survival time with a combination of DFMO and ara-C was observed when the ara-C therapy was initiated at the time of maximum accumulation of tumor cells in S phase.

That cellularly-synthesized 5'-methylthioadenosine as well as the cellular excretion of this nucleoside are altered in response to treatment with 5'-methylthiotubercidin suggests two possible sites at which 5'-methylthiotubercidin may exert its effect.","['White, M W', 'Riscoe, M K', 'Ferro, A J']","['White MW', 'Riscoe MK', 'Ferro AJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.- (Pentosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Pentosyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1983/06/02 00:00,1983/06/02 00:01,['1983/06/02 00:00'],"['1983/06/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/06/02 00:01 [medline]', '1983/06/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Jun 2;762(3):405-13. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(83)90005-8.,"['0167-4889(83)90005-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(83)90005-8 [doi]']","['CA 00617/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25756/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The values of Stokes radius (53 A), diffusion coefficient (4.05 x 10(-7) cm2/s) and frictional ratio (1.42) determined by gel filtration suggest that the native enzyme is compact and globular. Antibodies to DNA polymerase-alpha were raised in rabbits. These antibodies, partially purified by 50% ammonium sulfate saturation and Sephadex G-200 chromatography, gave one precipitin band on immunodiffusion and inactivate DNA polymerase-alpha-. This antibody preparation also inhibited, in vitro, the activity of DNA polymerase-alpha from calf thymus, phytohemagglutinin-stimulated normal human lymphocytes, as well as that from other leukemic cells.

For 2 of the positive cases (one kappa light chain type and one lambda light chain type) the urinary light chains were compared directly with culture fluids obtained after incubation of the corresponding neoplastic cells obtained from the patient's peripheral blood: identity of the light chains from urine and cells was established by isoelectric focusing demonstrating for both patients that the tumour cells were the source of the urinary light chain. In patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving neoplastic B lymphocytes, urinary monoclonal light chains were found in 7/16 of those studied.

It causes between 10% and 20% of infections in most hospitals. Pseudomonas infection is especially prevalent among patients with burn wounds, cystic fibrosis, acute leukemia, organ transplants, and intravenous-drug addiction. P. aeruginosa is a common nosocomial contaminant, and epidemics have been traced to many items in the hospital environment. Patients who are hospitalized for extended periods are frequently colonized by this organism and are at increased risk of developing infection. The most serious infections include malignant external otitis, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, meningitis, pneumonia, and septicemia. The likelihood of recovery from pseudomonas infection is related to the severity of the patient's underlying disease process. The introduction of the antipseudomonal aminoglycosides and penicillins has improved substantially the prognosis of these infections. Ticarcillin and carbenicillin have been especially beneficial in neutropenic patients; however, prompt institution of therapy is mandatory for optimal benefit. Many new drugs with antipseudomonal activity, including penicillins, cephalosporins, and other beta-lactams, have been introduced in recent years and offer the potential for new approaches to therapy for these infections.","['Bodey, G P', 'Bolivar, R', 'Fainstein, V', 'Jadeja, L']","['Bodey GP', 'Bolivar R', 'Fainstein V', 'Jadeja L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Rev Infect Dis,Reviews of infectious diseases,7905878,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Burns/complications', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Dogs', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Pseudomonas Infections/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/immunology/mortality', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa/isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Wound Infection/diagnosis']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Infect Dis. 1983 Mar-Apr;5(2):279-313. doi: 10.1093/clinids/5.2.279.,['10.1093/clinids/5.2.279 [doi]'],,,201,,,,,,,,,

Q31 cells are UV- and 4NQO-sensitive cells isolated from L5178Y cells. M10 cells are similar but are sensitive to ionizing radiation and 4NQO. After treatment with UV or 4NQO, chromatid-type aberrations in these cell strains were induced more frequently in the first mitotic cells, at late fixation times. After UV exposure (2.4 J/m2), the maximal frequencies of chromatid-type breaks in Q31 cells were about 5 times higher than in L5178Y cells. In M10 cells such breaks were only as frequent as in L5178Y cells. After 4NQO treatment (50 ng/ml) the frequencies of chromatid-type breaks in M10 and Q31 cells were significantly higher than in L5178Y cells. From these results and those of previous studies (Takahashi et al., 1982), M10 cells may be considered hypersensitive to gamma-rays and 4NQO, but not to UV, and thus react similarly to L5178Y cells. The hypersensitivity of M10 cells to 4NQO may result from a defect in the ionizing-radiation repair mechanism as has been suggested to occur in ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cells. Q31 cells are hypersensitive to UV and 4NQO, but not to gamma-rays. Q31 cells may be considered to be deficient in a UV-like repair pathway. In conclusion, characteristics of murine M10 and Q31 cells are compared with those of human AT and xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) cells.","['Takahashi, E I', 'Tobari, I', 'Shiomi, T', 'Sato, K']","['Takahashi EI', 'Tobari I', 'Shiomi T', 'Sato K']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Nitroquinolines)', '56-57-5 (4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide)']",IM,"['4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Nitroquinolines/*pharmacology', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1983/05/01 00:00,1983/05/01 00:01,['1983/05/01 00:00'],"['1983/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1983 May;109(2):207-17. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(83)90047-7.,"['0027-5107(83)90047-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(83)90047-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic B cells displayed rearrangements of their expressed mu and k or lambda genes. Surprisingly, the k constant region genes were deleted or rearranged in all lambda-expressing B lymphocytes examined. Most non-T, non-B lymphocytic leukemias had immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, which indicates that these cells were committed to B cell development at the immunoglobulin gene level. The pattern of immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in the B cell precursor and B cell leukemias suggests an ordered hierarchy of somatic rearrangements with mu genes preceding light chains and k light chain genes preceding lambda. Some of the leukemic T cells studied were homogeneous populations of cells that retained immunoregulatory functions with many Sezary T leukemic cells functioning as helper cells in their interactions with B lymphocytes. In contrast, malignant cells from patients with the adult T leukemia of Japan frequently functioned as suppressor cells. In contrast to normal unactivated T cells or other leukemic T cells, the leukemic T cells from all adult T cell leukemia patients studied had an activated receptor for T cell growth factor. The malignant cells of a patient with an acute T cell leukemia functioned as prosuppressor cells. Under the influence of normal T cells or their secreted inducer products, these leukemic cells matured both functionally and in terms of cell surface antigens into suppressor effector cells.","['Waldmann, T A', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Hieter, P A', 'Ravetch, J V', 'Broder, S', 'Leder, P']","['Waldmann TA', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Hieter PA', 'Ravetch JV', 'Broder S', 'Leder P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Fed Proc,Federation proceedings,0372771,"['0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinemia/complications/immunology', 'Animals', '*Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/genetics', 'Male', 'Sezary Syndrome/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1983/05/15 00:00,1983/05/15 00:01,['1983/05/15 00:00'],"['1983/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fed Proc. 1983 May 15;42(8):2498-503.,,,,15,,,,,,,,,

The parental Jijoye line is membrane-IgM positive and contains two normal-sized mu chains. Both are precipitable by anti-mu and anti-kappa sera. In addition, anti-mu also precipitated a 61K mu chain. A 61K mu chain was also identified in the following somatic hybrids: PICATPO, an autohybrid of two different P3HR-1 sublines, PUTRAL and PUT/ARH-77, derived from the fusion of PUT with the membrane-IgG-positive BL line Rael and the lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) ARH-77, respectively, and the HP-1 (PUT/HL-60) hybrid, derived from the fusion of PUT with the granulocytic leukemia line, HL-60.

In 4 out of 11 patients at malignant metamorphosis aneuploidy was noticed. From these findings it is concluded that bone marrow cell proliferation in CML patients at diagnosis and during apparent remission is not essentially different from normal. However, at malignant metamorphosis changes occur in ploidy level and proliferative activity, which can be detected by DNA-FCM already in an early phase.","['Holdrinet, R S', 'Pennings, A', 'van Egmond, J', 'Wessels, J M', 'Haanen, C']","['Holdrinet RS', 'Pennings A', 'van Egmond J', 'Wessels JM', 'Haanen C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1983;69(2):98-105. doi: 10.1159/000206862.,['10.1159/000206862 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we further examined therapy with monoclonal antibody of the IgG2a isotype, which was the most effective isotype studied. Intravenous infusion of ascites fluid containing the anti-Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody 19-E12 1-2 h after tumor implantation led to inhibition of the growth of 3 X 10(5) but not 3 X 10(6) syngeneic SL2 leukemic cells. The achievement of the maximal therapeutic effect required the infusion of a dose containing 3.2 mg of antibody, which inhibited the growth of a subcutaneous inoculum of 3 X 10(5) SL2 leukemic cells in 83% of treated mice. Multiple doses of antibody were no more effective than a single dose given shortly after tumor implantation. The infusion of this relatively large 3.2-mg dose of antibody was required to infiltrate the subcutaneous space and saturate surface Thy-1.1 sites on leukemic cells in a subcutaneous tumor nodule. The failure of antibody to inhibit larger numbers of tumor cells was investigated. Growth of a subcutaneous tumor nodule in mice challenged with more than 3 X 10(5) cells resulted from the growth of Thy-1.1-bearing cells in spite of the presence of the infused anti-Thy-1.1 antibody on their surfaces. In contrast, metastatic growth was due to the emergence of variant leukemic cells lacking the Thy-1.1 antigen. Thus, treatment of transplanted T leukemic cells with an IgG2a anti-Thy-1.1 monoclonal antibody was effective in eliminating 3 X 10(5) antigen-bearing leukemic cells from the subcutaneous space and was very effective in preventing metastasis of leukemic cells expressing the target Thy-1.1 antigen. Therapy was limited by the failure of host mechanisms to eliminate larger numbers of subcutaneous leukemic cells coated with the infused antibody and by the emergence of variant leukemic cells lacking the target antigen.","['Badger, C C', 'Bernstein, I D']","['Badger CC', 'Bernstein ID']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Isoantibodies/administration & dosage', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Splenic Neoplasms/secondary', 'Thymoma/immunology/*therapy']",1983/03/01 00:00,1983/03/01 00:01,['1983/03/01 00:00'],"['1983/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Mar 1;157(3):828-42. doi: 10.1084/jem.157.3.828.,['10.1084/jem.157.3.828 [doi]'],"['CA 09319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 26386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2186954,,,,,,,,,,

The lyophilized gamma-globulin preparation, termed leukoglobulin, contained about 50% immune IgG and suppressed the proliferation of heterotransplanted leukemia and lymphoma cells of human origin. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the potential therapeutic value of leukoglobulin and to determine its toxicity in humans with terminal leukemia and patients whose disease was unresponsive to current therapy. Two patients with CML, one with AMML, four with ALL, and one with AML were treated once a week for up to 5 weeks with leukoglobulin intravenously at doses ranging from 2 to 29 mg/kg. Leukoglobulin was well tolerated with minimal adverse effects and produced an initial mobilization of blasts from the bone marrow, spleen, and other organs with a parallel increase in the number of blasts in the systemic circulation. Subsequent injections of leukoglobulin led to a sharp decrease and the eventual eradication of blasts from the peripheral blood and bone marrow. Except in patients with CML, immature cells other than blasts also markedly diminished. The results of the clinical trials indicated a synergism with or potentiation of most chemotherapeutic agents used. Two possible uses for a combination of leukoglobulin and antileukemic drugs are indicated by the results we report here; drug-antibody synergism for cases showing no response to chemotherapy alone or leukoglobulin given immediately after chemotherapy is administered to eliminate residual leukemia cells. Alternatively, leukoglobulin can be given as a single therapeutic agent during the induction or maintenance phases of treatment to patients with leukemia resistant to other therapeutic combinations.","['Izquierdo, J', 'Robbio, E R', 'Lozzio, B B', 'Hanna, W']","['Izquierdo J', 'Robbio ER', 'Lozzio BB', 'Hanna W']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*administration & dosage/biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross Reactions', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Immunoelectrophoresis', 'Immunoglobulin G/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1983;105(1):83-93. doi: 10.1007/BF00391837.,['10.1007/BF00391837 [doi]'],"['17533/PHS HHS/United States', '18185/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The Mr = 84,000-85,000 polypeptides from all three organisms are closely related, the chicken and human polypeptides having many peptides in common. The relationship between the Mr = 70,000 polypeptides of the different organisms appears to be less close; possible explanations for this latter result are discussed.

Some bacteria induced peak IFN titers after 24 h of culture, whereas other bacteria showed maximal titers on culture days 2 to 3. The IFN displayed various properties. One type, which appeared early during the cultures, had characteristics of IFN-alpha, being resistant to pH 2 treatment but neutralized by antibodies to IFN-alpha. A second type, which appeared later, on culture days 2 to 3, resembled IFN-gamma in being sensitive to pH 2 treatment but resistant to anti-IFN-alpha antibodies. A third type, which appeared to be sensitive to both pH 2 and antibody treatment, was interpreted as atypical IFN-alpha. The application of cell fractionation procedures indicated that nonadherent, predominantly Fc receptor-bearing, non-T, non-B cells were producers of IFN-alpha as defined by its antigenic properties. They copurified approximately with cells carrying natural killer activity toward human erythroid leukemia K562 cells.

Suppression by inhibitors of fatty acid lipoxygenase.,76-85,"HeLa cells incubated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells incubated with calcium ionophore, showed increased levels of the protease plasminogen activator. These treatments have previously been shown to stimulate the cellular metabolism of arachidonic acid. The induction of plasminogen activator in both cell types was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid and nordihydroguaiaretic acid, two compounds known to inhibit arachidonate metabolism via lipoxygenases. In contrast, indomethacin, which selectively inhibits arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase, was inactive. The levels of four enzyme markers in HeLa cells were unchanged by treatment with TPA plus the lipoxygenase inhibitors, indicating that the inhibitors did not exert their effects on plasminogen activator via general cell toxicity. HeLa cells preincubated with [3H]arachidonate and subsequently challenged with TPA produced small amounts of material with the chromatographic mobilities and resistance to indomethacin expected of hydroxylated fatty acids derived via lipoxygenase. RBL-1 cells have been shown previously to produce leukotrienes and other lipoxygenase metabolites when treated with calcium ionophore. Plasminogen activator in HeLa cells was stimulated by up to 2.5-fold by incubation with 0.5-2 micrograms/ml 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. Our results suggest that the induction of plasminogen activator in HeLa and RBL-1 cells is not mediated by prostaglandins or thromboxanes, but may be mediated or modulated by arachidonate metabolites derived via a lipoxygenase pathway.","['Crutchley, D J', 'Maynard, J R']","['Crutchley DJ', 'Maynard JR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phorbols)', '1191-85-1 (5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '467RNW8T91 (5-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '7BO8G1BYQU (Masoprocol)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Catechols/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', '*Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Masoprocol', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Plasminogen Activators/*biosynthesis', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1983/02/16 00:00,1983/02/16 00:01,['1983/02/16 00:00'],"['1983/02/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/16 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1983 Feb 16;762(1):76-85. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(83)90119-2.,"['0167-4889(83)90119-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(83)90119-2 [doi]']",['HL-25864/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Lung toxicity is principally determined by an existing tumor burden at the time of drug administration. Thus when any of the four chemotherapeutic agents was given 5 days after L1210 transplantation there was no mortality. Pulmonary pathology in these mice was equivalent to that noted in normal mice receiving identical drug treatment or to that noted in untreated L1210-bearing mice sacrificed 7, 8, or 10 days after tumor transplantation. When chemotherapy was delayed to day 7 after L1210 transplantation for mitomycin C or to day 8 after transplantation for BCNU and cyclophosphamide, more severe pulmonary toxicity was found. Mortality within the first 5 days of treatment was 38, 50, and 80%, respectively. Pulmonary pathology included moderate to severe vascular congestion and interstitial pneumonitis, diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage often involving the entire pulmonary parenchyma, pulmonary edema, and alveolar cell metaplasia. A unique finding, associated with cyclophosphamide treatment, was the occurrence of perivascular-intramural edema of the walls of medium-size pulmonary vessels.

Syngeneic DBA/2 mice inoculated intraperitoneally with c127v-IC2 tumor cells survived significantly longer than did c127av-bearing mice. Similarly, c127v-IC2, but not c127av tumor cells, were found to augment NK activity of spleen and peritoneal exudate cells in both DBA/2 and BALB/c nu/nu mice when inoculated into the peritoneal cavity. C127v-IC2 tumor cells incubated with either DBA/2 or BALB/c nu/nu spleen cells in vitro boosted NK activity and induced the production of gamma-type interferon (IFN), whereas incubation with c127av tumor cells induced neither NK activity nor IFN. Two kinds of cells cooperated in the production of IFN in response to c127v-IC2 tumor cells, namely, cells which were nonadherent, bore asialo-GM1, NK-1.2 and a low level of Thy-1.2 antigen and thus closely resembled NK cells, and those which were adherent and phagocytic and lacked both asialo-GM1 and NK-1.2 markers, presumably macrophages. Further analysis strongly suggested that c127-v-IC2 tumor cells stimulate macrophages to produce factor(s) which can induce the production of IFN by NK cells. The induced IFN was shown to be of the gamma type by its lability at pH 2.0 and insusceptibility to anti-IFN alpha, beta serum. This suggests a novel pathway for NK cell activation, and strongly supports the importance of macrophages and NK cells in natural resistance against certain tumors.","['Kawase, I', 'Urdal, D L', 'Newman, W', 'Henney, C S']","['Kawase I', 'Urdal DL', 'Newman W', 'Henney CS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia L5178/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",1983/03/15 00:00,1983/03/15 00:01,['1983/03/15 00:00'],"['1983/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1983/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1983 Mar 15;31(3):365-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910310318.,['10.1002/ijc.2910310318 [doi]'],"['AI-15383/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-16496/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

The powerful, directly acting mutagen, p-NO2-NMA did not appear to induce tumors at all since its tumor spectrum was essentially identical to that of the untreated control rats. Thus, the carcinogenic activities of NMA and its substituted analogs do not appear to correlate with bacterial mutagenesis assays. Additionally, NMA, p-F-NMA and N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-bromoaniline, the last a strong mutagen in S. typhimurium, were shown not to induce sister chromatid exchanges in CHO cells and in a clone of a CHO:liver cell hybrid which had previously been shown to be sensitive to chemical agents which require metabolic activation.","['Kroeger-Koepke, M B', 'Reuber, M D', 'Iype, P T', 'Lijinsky, W', 'Michejda, C J']","['Kroeger-Koepke MB', 'Reuber MD', 'Iype PT', 'Lijinsky W', 'Michejda CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Aflatoxins)', '0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Nitroso Compounds)', '937-25-7 (N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-fluoroaniline)', '943-41-9 (N-nitroso-N-methyl-4-nitroaniline)', '9N2N2Y55MH (Aflatoxin B1)', '9SM68I29WQ (N-methyl-N-nitrosoaniline)']",IM,"['Aflatoxin B1', 'Aflatoxins/toxicity', 'Aniline Compounds/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced', 'Liver Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*chemically induced', '*Nitrosamines', 'Nitroso Compounds/*toxicity', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Sister Chromatid Exchange/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Testicular Neoplasms/chemically induced']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 1983;4(2):157-60. doi: 10.1093/carcin/4.2.157.,['10.1093/carcin/4.2.157 [doi]'],['N01-CO-75380/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of 10 different tissues for their MGBG content during the treatment revealed little evidence for a tissue specific cumulative accumulation of the drug given either alone or in combination with DFMO. On the contrary, tissue MGBG levels tended to increase until the 4th to 7th day of the treatment, whereafter a gradual decline or a plateau was obvious in most tissues. The concomitant DFMO treatment produced a consistent elevation of tissue MGBG concentrations in bone marrow cells and possibly also in intestinal tissue. In L1210 leukemia-bearing DBA mice, MGBG was most actively taken up by the ascitic leukemia cells. A priming of the tumor-bearing mice with DFMO for a few days before the start of MGBG injections resulted in a strikingly enhanced accumulation of the latter drug in the leukemia cells and also in the spleen, which was apparently heavily infiltrated by tumor cells. In liver, small intestine and in bone marrow cells of tumor-bearing animals the concentration of MGBG was not influenced by the DFMO treatment. In DBA mice without the L1210 tumor, DFMO only insignificantly increased the level of MGBG in bone marrow cells whereas no increase was seen in the spleen, in contrast to the same organ obtained from tumor-bearing mice. This combined treatment, in comparison with DFMO or MGBG alone, also produced the best therapeutic response as revealed by marked reduction of the tumor mass.","['Seppanen, P', 'Alhonen-Hongisto, L', 'Janne, J']","['Seppanen P', 'Alhonen-Hongisto L', 'Janne J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Guanidines)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Eflornithine', 'Female', 'Guanidines/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mitoguazone/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Ornithine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Spleen/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Distribution']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1983 Feb;18(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(83)90111-8.,"['0304-3835(83)90111-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(83)90111-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

PCA-1 and PCA-2 are not expressed on either normal T or B lymphocytes, but are weakly expressed on granulocytes and monocytes. When pokeweed mitogen is used to induce human B lymphocyte differentiation, PCA-1 is expressed when other B cell determinants are lost and plasmacytoid morphology, intracytoplasmic immunoglobulins, and surface T10 staining characteristic of plasma cells appear.

All 12 cases of the T cell type had germ-line kappa and lambda genes and 11 of 12 had germ-line heavy chain genes. In contrast, all 25 cases of the ""non-T, non-B"" classification, which lacked both definitive T cell markers and surface immunoglobulin, had rearranged immunoglobulin genes, indicating that they represent precursor cells already committed to the B cell lineage at the gene level. 14 had rearranged heavy chain genes, yet retained germ-line light chain genes, whereas 11 cases had both heavy and light chain gene reorganizations. All patterns of immunoglobulin gene rearrangement predicted by a model that proceeds from heavy chain gene recombination to light chain genes were observed. Despite the uniform presence of rearranged immunoglobulin genes, only five cases produced cytoplasmic mu-chain, one exceptional case produced gamma-chain, and another produced only lambda-chain. The cases of B cell precursor type that do not produce immunoglobulin may represent cells that frequently possess ineffectively rearranged immunoglobulin genes. Included in this group may be a set of cells trapped within the B cell precursor series because their ineffective rearrangements have eliminated certain gene subsegments necessary for the assemblage of an effective heavy chain gene. All seven cases of the non-T, non-B subgroup that bore HLA-DR but lacked CALLA (the common acute lymphocytic leukemia-associated antigen) represented the earliest recognizable stage of B cell precursors with rearranged heavy chain genes but germ-line light chain genes. Correlations here suggest that cells entering B cell development express HLA-DR and rearrange heavy chain genes before the expression of a B cell-associated antigen recognized by the antibody BA-1, the antigen CALLA, and any subsequent light chain gene rearrangements.","['Korsmeyer, S J', 'Arnold, A', 'Bakhshi, A', 'Ravetch, J V', 'Siebenlist, U', 'Hieter, P A', 'Sharrow, S O', 'LeBien, T W', 'Kersey, J H', 'Poplack, D G', 'Leder, P', 'Waldmann, T A']","['Korsmeyer SJ', 'Arnold A', 'Bakhshi A', 'Ravetch JV', 'Siebenlist U', 'Hieter PA', 'Sharrow SO', 'LeBien TW', 'Kersey JH', 'Poplack DG', 'Leder P', 'Waldmann TA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1983 Feb;71(2):301-13. doi: 10.1172/jci110770.,['10.1172/jci110770 [doi]'],"['CA-28526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC436868,,,,,,,,,,

There was no increased toxicity among the combination-treated animals. Large increases in lifespan were obtained against L1210 and B16. Maximally tolerated doses of the single agents could be combined without increased toxicity. The combination of MMC and MTX was synergistic against ip L1210 and P388 leukemias. The responses of mice bearing L1210 to treatment on days 1, 5, and 9 respectively, were 42% ILS for 3.0 mg/kg MMC; 96% ILS for 15 mg/kg MTX; 172% ILS with four out of ten survivors for 3.0 mg/kg MMC plus 15 mg/kg MTX.

The proportion of monocytes capable of binding and killing varies between individuals and also depends on the tumor cell used, indicating heterogeneity in the monocyte and tumor cell populations. The highest proportion of monocytes bind to the human erythromyeloid leukemia K562 cell line (13%-50%). The frequency of monocytes capable of killing K562 tumor cells is relatively low (7%-13%).

We have studied the type and distribution of GAGs in neutrophil granule subpopulations of normal and leukemic myeloid cells using ultrastructural, cytochemical, immunologic, and biochemical methods. At the ultrastructural level, high-iron diamine-thiocarbohydrazide-silver proteinate (HID-TCH-SP) stained sulfated glycoconjugates selectively in immature primary granules of normal promyelocytes and Auer rods and immature granules of leukemic myeloblasts. Staining was weak or absent in mature primary granules, whereas tertiary granules stained moderately. Primary granule staining with HID-TCH-SP was greatly diminished by prior treatment of the specimens with chondroitinase ABC and/or nitrous acid, indicating the presence of chondroitin sulfate and N-sulfated glycosaminoglycan. Immunostaining of myeloid cells with a rabbit antichondroitin 4-sulfate and ferritin-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG sequence resulted in staining of most primary granules. Biochemical analysis of GAGs from leukemic myeloblasts containing primary granules and Auer rods, but lacking secondary and tertiary granules, revealed 8 x 10(-17) mole of uronic acid/cell and electrophoretic and sulfaminohexose analysis showed 60%-70% chondroitin sulfate AC of heterogeneous molecular weight, 20%-30% of a GAG that most closely resembled heparan sulfate, and 10% dermatan sulfate. The lack of significant HID-TCH-SP staining of sulfate iin sites other than Auer rods and primary granules in leukemic myeloblasts indicates that these granules contain the chondroitin, dermatan, and heparan sulfate isolated from the same specimen. Similar GAGs are present in primary granules of normal cells as evidenced by their cytochemical and immunostaining properties. Thus, these studies demonstrate a heterogeneous population of GAGs not previously identified and localize these substances to the primary granule of leukemic and normal cells.","['Parmley, R T', 'Hurst, R E', 'Takagi, M', 'Spicer, S S', 'Austin, R L']","['Parmley RT', 'Hurst RE', 'Takagi M', 'Spicer SS', 'Austin RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Hexosamines)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (glucosaminoglycans)', '0 (sulfaminohexose)', '9007-28-7 (Chondroitin Sulfates)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Chondroitin Lyases)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/blood', 'Chondroitin Lyases/metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfates/immunology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/analysis', 'Glycosaminoglycans/*blood', 'Hexosamines/blood', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronoglucosaminidase/metabolism', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Neutrophils/*analysis']",1983/02/01 00:00,1983/02/01 00:01,['1983/02/01 00:00'],"['1983/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1983 Feb;61(2):257-66.,['S0006-4971(20)80925-2 [pii]'],"['DE-02670/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 24509/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cells that expressed surface Ig of the lambda light chain type frequently exported IgD (10/12 patients), whereas cells expressing surface Ig of the kappa light chain type exported no IgD, although most (8/11 patients) were able to export IgM. It appears, therefore, that in most of the 23 cases studied, cells synthesizing IgD with lambda light chains can both express and export IgD, whereas those synthesizing IgD kappa can only insert it into the surface membrane. This finding and the known preponderance of lambda in plasma IgD imply that the possession of a lambda chain facilitates the IgD secretory pathway, a conclusion that implicates a control mechanism subsequent to the surface/secretory dichotomy arising from different splicings of heavy chain messenger RNA.","['Stevenson, F K', 'Stevenson, G T', 'Tutt, A L']","['Stevenson FK', 'Stevenson GT', 'Tutt AL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/analysis', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1983 Jan 1;157(1):337-41. doi: 10.1084/jem.157.1.337.,['10.1084/jem.157.1.337 [doi]'],,PMC2186884,,,,,,,,,,

Rearrangements of chromosome 1 were found in all the patients. The most consistent abnormality was a large marker involving the long arm of No. 1, found in six patients, including the patient with macroglobulinemia.

The translocations occurred with No. 9 in two, with No. 16 in two, and Nos. 8, 17, and 18 each in one patient. The survival time from the diagnosis was less than 1 year in five of them and over 2 years in one. The only patient whose cells lacked an extra 1q lived for over 3 years. Five 14q+ marker chromosomes were detected in three patients. The donor chromosome was No. 11 in one of these and was undetermined in the others; the size of each 14q+ marker seemed quite different which suggested different donor chromosomes. Loss of a sex chromosome was found in five patients. Loss of No. 13 and gain of No. 7 or 7q were each found in two patients. Rearrangement or deletion of the short arm of No. 8 was found in five patients. A rearrangement of 9p was found in three patients.

During 2 hr of incubation, K562 cells spontaneously released a mean of 9 ng of 15-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 35 ng of 5-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and 87 ng of a partially resolved mixture of 11- and 12-monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid per 10(7) cells. The addition of 50 micrograms of arachidonic acid per ml to the cell cultures increased the quantities of monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids generated after 2 hr of incubation by 10- to 100-fold; changes in the ratios of these lipoxygenase products occurred over 24 hr of incubation. The tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, at concentrations of 5 to 25 ng/ml increased arachidonic acid lipoxygenation 1- to 2-fold in cultures containing 50 micrograms of arachidonic acid per ml, and up to 20-fold in cultures not supplemented with arachidonic acid. The lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid was enhanced 2- to 9-fold for up to 24 hr after a 2-hr exposure of K562 cells to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid, a lipoxygenase inhibitor, blocked the effects of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, suggesting that the monohydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids are the products of specific lipoxygenases rather than of nonenzymatic oxidative reactions. The capacities of phorbol esters to promote tumors in the mouse skin model corresponded to their respective capacities to enhance the lipoxygenation of arachidonic acid to 15- and 5-monohydroxyeico-satetraenoic acid but not to 11- and 12-monohydroxyeico-satetraenoic acid.","['Valone, F H', 'Obrist, R', 'Tarlin, N', 'Bast, R C Jr']","['Valone FH', 'Obrist R', 'Tarlin N', 'Bast RC Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Arachidonate Lipoxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Arachidonate Lipoxygenases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Lipoxygenase/*metabolism', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1983/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1983 Jan;43(1):197-201.,,['AI 18262/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells and eosinophils in all stages of maturity, including unusual atypical eosinophil precursors, were seen in a prominent infiltration of the spleen and the liver. Blasts were far more numerous in the viscera, especially in the liver, than in the marrow and peripheral blood. Enzyme histochemical studies of plastic sections showed that blasts were reactive for cyanide-resistant peroxidase, which is specific for eosinophils, and could therefore be regarded as part of an eosinophilic leukemic proliferation. Some eosinophils showed aberrant reactivity for chloroacetate esterase. The existence of a neoplastic proliferation of eosinophils is consistent with the view that eosinophils represent a distinct marrow line. The possibility that hypereosinophilic patients may harbor a far more prominent blastosis in the viscera than is apparent from marrow and blood picture is also stressed.

Studies designed to investigate the relationship between structure and activity conducted with the anthracyclines in HL-60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells indicated a dissociation between cytotoxicity and maturation-inducing properties of these agents. In an analogous manner, 6-thioguanine induced effective erythroid and granulocytic differentiation of Friend and HL-60 leukemias, respectively, only in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficient cells. These findings suggest that 6-thioguanine need not be metabolized to a nucleotide to be active as an inducer of differentiation, and that the concentration of the 6-thiopurine required to initiate the commitment to maturation is greater than that producing cytotoxicity. Erythrodifferentiation of HGPRT negative Friend murine leukemia cells by 6-thioguanine was antagonized by tetracaine, d, 1-propranolol and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, providing evidence for a cell membrane mediated component in the action of the purine antimetabolite. This suggests that the biochemical events that produce differentiation after exposure to 6-thioguanine may differ from those responsible for the toxic actions of the drug. Studies such as these, designed to gain an understanding of the target sites of inducers of differentiation, may lead to the development of new agents of potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of certain forms of cancer based on the conversion of malignant cells to their non-proliferating mature counterparts.","['Schwartz, E L', 'Ishiguro, K', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Schwartz EL', 'Ishiguro K', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '3296X8L13E (marcellomycin)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Anthracyclines', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Naphthacenes/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thioguanine/pharmacology']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1983;21:3-20. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(83)90005-5.,['10.1016/0065-2571(83)90005-5 [doi]'],"['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,84,,,,,,,,,

A concerted effort was made to explore the relationship between the structures of these compounds and their antitumor activity against P388 and L1210 leukemias. This article describes the computer-assisted structure-activity evaluation of more than 14,000 compounds, representing different classes of Michael acceptors, in the NCI file. In this study, advantage has been taken of the computer's ability to search substructures according to precise definitions and to manipulate these substructures utilizing Boolean logic. Olefinic conjugated Michael-type acceptors, e.g., styrenes with different activating groups, cinnamic acid derivatives, and alpha,beta-unsaturated nitro, cyano, sulfone, sulfoxide, and acetylenic compounds, have shown appreciable activity against P388 lymphocytic leukemia. The analysis of lactones and lactams includes substructures representing a wide variety of exocyclic and endocyclic alpha,beta-unsaturated compounds. The analysis describes the effect of certain groups, such as an --OH, --OR, alpha,beta-unsaturated ester, or epoxide, adjacent to the alpha,beta-unsaturated center, on the antitumor activity of these compounds. A combination of one or more of these activating groups with an alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone moiety significantly enhanced the activity against P388. In general, many of the classes of compounds studied have shown poor activity against the more stringent L1210 lymphoid leukemia.","['Nasr, M', 'Paull, K D', 'Narayanan, V L']","['Nasr M', 'Paull KD', 'Narayanan VL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Adv Pharmacol Chemother,Advances in pharmacology and chemotherapy,0237113,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ketones)', '0 (Lactams)', '0 (Lactones)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Computers', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Ketones/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Lactams/pharmacology', 'Lactones/pharmacology', '*Structure-Activity Relationship']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Pharmacol Chemother. 1984;20:123-90. doi: 10.1016/s1054-3589(08)60266-5.,['10.1016/s1054-3589(08)60266-5 [doi]'],,,41,,,,,,,,,

He was appointed full-time Director of Pediatric Hematology in 1959. His early clinical studies were concerned with treatment of erythroblastosis fetalis and use of frequent transfusions and desferroxamine in children with thalassemia. The combined tumor clinic at the Babies Hospital, established in 1952, was one of the first to use the multidisciplinary approach to treatment of the child with cancer. In 1957, the Children's Leukemia Group A, later called the Children's Cancer Study Group, was established by Dr. Joseph Burchenal. Dr. Wolff was one of the first members. This group led to the establishment of various national intergroup committees for clinical study of cancers in children. In 1954, Farber began to use dactinomycin for treatment of Wilms' tumor. At first this drug was used only for treatment of metastatic tumors, but later it was also used to prevent metastases. Subsequently, other childhood tumors were found to be amenable to chemotherapy.","['Pochedly, C']",['Pochedly C'],['eng'],"['Biography', 'Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Portrait']",,United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,,IM,"['Hematology/*history', 'History, 20th Century', 'Medical Oncology/*history', 'Pediatrics/*history', 'United States']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1984 Winter;6(4):455-8. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198424000-00011.,['10.1097/00043426-198424000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,['Wolff JA <Suffix>3rd</Suffix>'],"['Wolff, J A <Suffix>3rd</Suffix>']"

The disease ran its course uninfluenced by this treatment; most children died in a matter of a few months. The success of nitrogen mustard in the treatment of lymphomas and chronic leukemias encouraged efforts to try various drugs in the treatment of acute leukemia. In 1948, Farber and colleagues at the Boston Children's Hospital reported that aminopterin produced complete remissions in about one-third of children with acute leukemia. The dramatic success of this trial proved to be a monumental step forward for the field of cancer chemotherapy.

Use in pediatric chemotherapy.,397-413,"The comprehensive use of methotrexate is possible because there is an easy way of reducing the toxic effects of this drug. Effective in the antidotic action are alkalinization of the urine, increasing hydration of the patient, and ""rescue"" of purine and pyrimidine metabolism in the tissues by use of reduced folates. Only intravenous administration, by means of infusion given over a long period (24 hours or more), results in reliable and reproducible concentrations in the plasma. Oral administration should be abandoned because of the variable resorption and the different concentrations reached in plasma by different individuals.

Oncogene alteration by point mutations can result in a protein product with strongly enhanced oncogenic potential. Aberrant expression of cellular oncogenes may be due to tumor-specific chromosomal translocations that dysregulate the normal functions of a proto-oncogene. Amplification of cellular oncogenes can also augment their expression by increasing the amount of DNA template available for the production of mRNA. It appears that amplification of certain oncogenes is a common correlate of the progression of some tumours and also occurs as a rare sporadic event affecting various oncogenes in different types of cancer. Amplified copies of oncogenes may or may not be associated with chromosomal abnormalities signifying DNA amplification: double minute chromosomes and homogeneously staining chromosomal regions. Amplified oncogenes, whether sporadic or tumour type-specific, are expressed at elevated levels, in some cases in cells where their diploid forms are normally silent. Increased dosage of an amplified oncogene may contribute to the multistep progression of at least some cancers.","['Alitalo, K']",['Alitalo K'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,Finland,Med Biol,Medical biology,0417300,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Replication', '*Gene Amplification', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Biol. 1984;62(6):304-17.,,,,91,,,,,,,,,

Additional immunological, morphological, biochemical, cytokinetic, and cytogenetic factors have been identified, illustrating the heterogeneity of ALL and its derivation from malignant clones at various stages of differentiation and with varying rates of proliferation. Of biologic importance, these factors may refine further the characteristic features of clinically-determined prognostic groups. Multivariate analysis of large prospective trials with homogeneous therapy will be required to determine the independent prognostic importance of these factors. Current treatment strategies in ALL include (1) tailoring therapy and its intensity to prognostic groups; (2) multiple-drug combinations in induction; (3) early use of intrathecal (IT) methotrexate (MTX); (4) CNS prophylaxis with IT MTX alone in good prognosis patients and combined cranial radiation (CXRT), 1800 rads plus IT MTX, in average and poor prognosis patients. Current studies show a CNS relapse rate of 5% in all prognostic groups. Late neuropsychological defects caused by cranial XRT and IT MTX have prompted programs designed to reduce the potential late toxicity of CNS prophylaxis. More pronounced in younger children, these abnormalities include decreased IQ, visual-motor incoordination, poor performance in mathematics, and memory dysfunction. Until 1980, more intensive induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy had failed to prolong DFS in children with a poor prognosis. In West Germany (Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocol) a 70 to 75% DFS is seen in all patients regardless of initial WBC, suggesting that effective therapy will override prognostic factors. Ultra-high-dose MTX, without cranial radiation, is also showing promise in poor prognosis patients. Other issues include the optimal duration of therapy, the role of testicular biopsies, and prophylactic testicular radiation. Recent studies suggest that prognostic factors lose their significance after 2 years of continuous complete remission and that 2 years of maintenance therapy is adequate. Bilateral open-wedge testicular biopsies have identified occult testicular disease in 8 to 10% of males. A unified approach to children with leukemia/lymphoma, a group with a particularly poor prognosis, utilizing NHL-type therapy may be more effective than conventional ALL therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Miller, L P', 'Miller, D R']","['Miller LP', 'Miller DR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocytes/classification', 'Male', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Racial Groups', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Sex Factors']",1983/01/01 00:00,1983/01/01 00:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1983/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1983;1(2):129-97. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(83)80007-9.,"['S1040-8428(83)80007-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(83)80007-9 [doi]']",,,426,,,,,,,,,

CR is lowered by remission-inducing treatment (radiation and/or chemotherapy) in leukaemia, but more severely by certain antibiotics. Development (by selection or transfer) of resistance to these antibiotics may lead to overgrowth and penetration of the mucosal lining by the overgrowing (potentially) pathogenic bacteria. Other antibiotics however, if sufficiently dosed, have been found to eliminate (potential) pathogens selectively without decreasing CR.

Total body irradiation.,227-33,"Low dose total body irradiation (TBI) administered in small fractional doses (5-10 cGy) for the treatment of disseminated malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can be extremely toxic with substantial bone marrow depression. We elected to study bone marrow suppression following fractionated TBI in the rabbit. New Zealand white/female rabbits were thus treated with one of the following three schedules: (1) 3 fractions of 10 cGy per week; (2) 5 fractions of 10 cGy per week; and (3) 5 fractions of 25 cGy per week. Total doses ranged from 1050 to 2625 cGy and animals were sacrificed immediately, 4 weeks, or 8 weeks following completion of therapy. With the 10 cGy/day schedules, slight depression of total WBC counts and lymphocyte numbers occurred during and to the completion of irradiation followed by a rebound to greater than normal levels. With the 25 cGy schedule, a significant WBC and lymphocyte depression occurred at an accumulated dose of 1000 cGy and continued to decrease up to 2500 cGy, followed again by a rebound to greater than normal levels. The depression with the 25 cGy fractions was significantly greater than with the 10 cGy daily fractions. Thus, the severe and persistent peripheral blood count depression observed in CLL patients treated with TBI in small fractional doses was not reproduced in the normal rabbits. Possible explanations for this paradox are offered.","['Rubin, P', 'Constine, L S 3rd', 'Scarantino, C W']","['Rubin P', 'Constine LS 3rd', 'Scarantino CW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Erythrocyte Count', 'Female', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Rabbits', '*Regeneration', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1984/10/01 00:00,1984/10/01 00:01,['1984/10/01 00:00'],"['1984/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1984 Oct;2(3):227-33. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(84)80063-8.,"['S0167-8140(84)80063-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(84)80063-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The loss of proliferative capacity is revealed to be a complex multistep process during which the cells progress through a series of stages, including a precommitment ""initiation"" stage, a stage suggestive of the accumulation of commitment-related factors, and, finally, a stage of expression of the characteristics of the differentiated state. Cell cycle arrest in G1 phase of the cell cycle may, in part at least, be related to down-regulation of protein p53 synthesis. Expression of induced differentiation is accompanied by an acceleration of transcription at the globin loci, and possibly by posttranscriptional modulation of globin mRNA accumulation, as well. Cells at the stage of erythroid cell development represented by the transformed, differentiation-arrested MELC, have acquired a unique DNA structure and chromatin configuration around the globin genes which distinguish them from other, nonerythroid cells; additional complex changes in chromatin configuration accompany, and probably precede, inducer-mediated acceleration of globin gene transcription during terminal differentiation. Passage through G1 and early S phase of the cell cycle, in the presence of inducer, is critical for subsequent globin gene expression and may be important in establishing the chromatin reconfiguration required for gene expression.","['Rifkind, R A', 'Sheffery, M', 'Marks, P A']","['Rifkind RA', 'Sheffery M', 'Marks PA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Adv Cancer Res,Advances in cancer research,0370416,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Chromatin/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Genes', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53']",1984/01/01 00:00,1984/01/01 00:01,['1984/01/01 00:00'],"['1984/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Cancer Res. 1984;42:149-66. doi: 10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60457-1.,"['S0065-230X(08)60457-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0065-230x(08)60457-1 [doi]']","['CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-31768/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,95,,,,,,,,,

Before 9 overt CNS relapses, the mean increase of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta 2m concentration was 588 micrograms/l/month (range: -50 to +2020), which was significantly higher than the steady levels during maintenance treatment. Although the absolute value of CSF beta 2m was increased to 1 430 micrograms/l in the group with overt CNS relapse, individual variations in CSF beta 2m before a relapse were so great that no difference was seen between samples from CSF with or without lymphoblasts. The ratio between beta 2m in the CSF and in serum did not increase in serial samples prior to overt relapse, but the ratio was higher in patients with CNS relapse compared with a control group on maintenance therapy. In 9 children without CNS leukemia, the beta 2m concentration in CSF and serum decreased to a nadir 4 weeks after the start of induction treatment. The subsequent increase of CSF beta 2m was similar to the increase before a CNS relapse. Mean values of CSF beta 2m changes differed between groups of children with and without CNS leukemia early in the induction phase and during the maintenance treatment, but the wide range in individual values made serial beta 2m determinations unsuitable for detecting a CNS relapse.","['Clausen, N', 'Ibsen, K K']","['Clausen N', 'Ibsen KK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica,0000211,['0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Central Nervous System/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*cerebrospinal fluid/complications/pathology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Paediatr Scand. 1984 Nov;73(6):848-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.1984.tb17786.x.,['10.1111/j.1651-2227.1984.tb17786.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

This substance resembles parathormone in pseudo-hyperparathyroidism, prostaglandins, or other substances not yet identified. The most common tumors involved are bronchial or renal cancers. Diagnostic problems vary depending on whether the cancer has been identified or not, and if bony metastases have or have not been discovered. Primary hyperparathyroidism must also be considered since it is frequently associated with cancer. Hypercalcemia from blood dyscrasias (myeloma and lymphoma) originates from the same mechanisms. It may or may not be associated with bony lesions. The hypercalcemia could be due to a ""parathormone like"" substance, to prostaglandins, to a substance that stimulates osteoclasts (OAF), or to calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol). The treatment of hypercalcemia due to malignancies is primarily through the use of antiosteoclastic agents: calcitonin, mithramycin, and more recently diphosphonates.

Blastic metamorphoses of CMPD are regressions to a more primitive level of cellular differentiation. The predominant proliferative cell line characterizes the classical entities of PV, PT and CML, and their different prognoses. Pure erythrocytic and megakaryocytic proliferations are more compatible with sustained physiologic bone marrow functions than granulocytic proliferations. The combinations of granulocytic and megakaryocytic growth are especially prone to develop MF/OMS, in which participation of immune reactions, of granulocytic and of platelet factors is probable. An etiologic role for ineffective thrombocytopoiesis is supported by experimental as well as by histologic evidence. Myelofibrosis and osteomyelosclerosis may have similar causes, but develop independently. The prevalence of the female sex among thrombocythaemic patients was proven statistically also for the increase of giant type megakaryocytes in the form of clusters in the bone marrow, and for longer median survival of females in CMPD, especially when there is megakaryocytosis in the bone marrow. It is assumed that females may be better protected against the detrimentous effects of abnormal platelet production. An arbitrary classification according to haematologic and histologic criteria was applied to PV, PT and CML, and groups with typical and atypical haematologic and histologic signs were distinguished. The latter cannot be separated from each other by their various haematologic manifestations, but by histology and their different propensity to progress into more immature and/or fibrotic stages. Three major groups are characterized by histology: mixed granulocytic-megakaryocytic myelosis with giant megakaryocytic clusters, a similar variant with diffuse distribution of giant megakaryocytes, and immature and/or pleomorphic megakaryocytic myelosis. Transitions from each of these groups have been observed as well as transitions from each of the typical CMPD-entities into these less typical forms. CML, frequently accompanied by dwarf-megakaryocytes, often develops into pleomorphic megakaryocytic or blastic myelosis. Blastic dedifferentiation and myelofibrosis manifest themselves as closely related end stages, to which principally all groups proceed after a longer or shorter period of time, modified by the proliferating cell lines in each group. Clinical, experimental and histologic evidence of this natural history has been reviewed, with special emphasis on the re-evaluation of technically optimal bone marrow biopsies of untreated patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Burkhardt, R', 'Bartl, R', 'Jager, K', 'Frisch, B', 'Kettner, G', 'Mahl, G', 'Sund, M']","['Burkhardt R', 'Bartl R', 'Jager K', 'Frisch B', 'Kettner G', 'Mahl G', 'Sund M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/classification/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology', 'Thrombocytosis/pathology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1984 Nov;179(2):131-86. doi: 10.1016/S0344-0338(84)80124-7.,"['S0344-0338(84)80124-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0344-0338(84)80124-7 [doi]']",,,224,,,,,,,,,

In all nine patients with grade I, elevation of the serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase level without an increase in the serum bilirubin level was observed, which suggested the presence of GVHD in the liver. All 11 patients with grade I and II responded well to therapy with predonisolone. Eleven (73%) of the 15 patients who survived for more than 100 days after marrow transplantation developed chronic GVHD. As signs of chronic GVHD, hepatic disturbances were observed in nine patients (82%), while exanthema, ophthalmic symptoms and oral mucosal symptoms were observed in seven (64%), six (55%) and four (36%), respectively. These symptoms could be well controlled by predonisolone combined with either azathioprine or cyclosporin A.

The first group of 10 patients were given marrow grafts at the time of leukemic relapse and the second group of six patients were given the grafts in the period of remission of their disease. For the first group (ALL/ANLL 2:8, age (median) 33, M/F 8:2), HLA-identical donor cells (25 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with NSC D 245382 (ACNU) or daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide (CY) and a single shot of 1000 rad of TBI. For the second group (ALL/ANLL 4:2, age (median) 20, M/F 5:1), HLA-identical donor cells (22 x 10(7)/kg [median]) were infused after the patients were conditioned with CY and fractionated (250 rad x 4) TBI. All the patients were isolated in a laminar air flow room (LAF) after gut and skin decontamination. Engraftment of donor cells was confirmed in 15 out of the 16 patients. Febrile periods in LAF and the days required for platelet transfusion were prolonged in the first group. All the patients in the first group died within 12-214 days after BMT because of interstitial pneumonitis (7 patients) or bacterial infection (3 patients). On the other hand, five out of six patients in the second group are alive 84-540 days after BMT. For the surviving patients, the complications of chronic graft versus host disease, viral infections, tuberculosis, hepatitis, hemorrhagic cystitis and recurrence of leukemia are now the problems. It can be stated that the patient's clinical condition at the time of BMT is one of the most essential factors for the success of BMT although the effects of other variables, such a change in the conditioning regimens of the supportive care, must also be carefully analyzed.","['Kodera, Y', 'Morishima, Y', 'Morishita, Y', 'Murase, T', 'Okumura, M', 'Yamada, H', 'Minami, S', 'Kato, Y', 'Ogura, M', 'Nagura, E']","['Kodera Y', 'Morishima Y', 'Morishita Y', 'Murase T', 'Okumura M', 'Yamada H', 'Minami S', 'Kato Y', 'Ogura M', 'Nagura E', 'et al.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1984 Dec;14 Suppl 1:479-85.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 stimulates terminal differentiation of M1 and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells and epidermal keratinocytes, blocks dimethylsulfoxide-induced differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells, and enhances chemically induced transformation of BALB 3T3 cells. Unlike TPA, 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 does not induce ornithine decarboxylase in mouse skin, but inhibits induction of this enzyme by TPA. These actions are all specific for 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3: at least 100 times higher doses of other derivatives of vitamin D3 are required for the same biological effects. A specific cytosol receptor for 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 was found in these cells, suggesting that this compound has a receptor mediated action.

The concept of treating erythroblastosis fetalis by exchange transfusion grew from our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease, as first explained by Philip Levine and Alexander Wiener. Three techniques of exchange transfusion were tried.

Many murine monoclonal antibodies that react with glycosphingolipids have been described recently. Most of these antibodies have been elicited by immunization with tumor cells and they may also bind to glycoproteins that contain similar carbohydrate sequences. Immunization with a variety of tissues, murine teratocarcinomas, myeloid leukemia, and carcinomas of the human lung, colon and stomach, has elicited antibodies that react with the sugar sequence Gal beta 1-4[Fuc alpha 1-3]GlcNAc beta 1-3Gal----. The suppression of lymphocyte responses to mitogens and antigens by gangliosides in vitro has led to suggestions that these glycolipids possess immunodulatory properties in vivo. The in vitro studies were performed by incubating mononuclear cells with either dispersions of pure gangliosides or ganglioside-containing liposomes. In vivo gangliosides are found only in cell membranes or in lipoproteins, where they represent a small mole percent of total lipids, and there is little information about the transfer of gangliosides from lipoproteins to cells in vivo. A role for gangliosides as modulators of the immune response is an interesting possibility that is not supported by physiologically relevant data at present.","['Marcus, D M']",['Marcus DM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigens/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Glycosphingolipids/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Lipoproteins', 'Liposomes', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology', 'Sialic Acids/blood', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1984 Nov;21(11):1083-91. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(84)90118-4.,['10.1016/0161-5890(84)90118-4 [doi]'],,,98,,,,,,,,,

This method combines a radiant heat technology with monitoring of individual rectal temperatures at 10-min intervals. In 66 heating sessions, involving 116 AKR mice and a total of 619 WBH treatments, the mortality rate was less than 1%. Treatment at 41-42 degrees C for periods of up to 120 min were accomplished. Relationships of several variables of mouse temperature-time profiles were studied including (1) initial core temperature, (2) rate of heating, (3) whole body irradiation, and (4) the presence of tumor (transplanted AKR leukemia). Sham treatments produce a consistent temperature-time profile showing about a 1 degree C rise. Between-mouse variability, as well as between-treatment variability in individual animals was estimated. Thermal mapping of the device demonstrates a range from 32-38 degrees C of the air temperature in the zone with the mice to a high of 47 degrees C near to the radiant heating surface at the top of the apparatus.","['Robins, H I', 'Steeves, R A', 'Shecterle, L M', 'Martin, P A', 'Miller, K A', 'Paliwal, B', 'Neville, A J', 'Dennis, W H']","['Robins HI', 'Steeves RA', 'Shecterle LM', 'Martin PA', 'Miller KA', 'Paliwal B', 'Neville AJ', 'Dennis WH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Med Phys,Medical physics,0425746,,IM,"['Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*methods', 'Leukemia, Experimental/radiotherapy/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Phys. 1984 Nov-Dec;11(6):833-9. doi: 10.1118/1.595571.,['10.1118/1.595571 [doi]'],"['P01-CA19278/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA35361/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25-CA18397/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that patients developing IP have restrictive ventilatory changes, but in the absence of complicating IP, the marrow transplant regimen (including marrow infusion and total body irradiation) leaves pulmonary function largely unchanged.","['Springmeyer, S C', 'Silvestri, R C', 'Flournoy, N', 'Kosanke, C W', 'Peterson, D L', 'Huseby, J S', 'Hudson, L D', 'Storb, R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Springmeyer SC', 'Silvestri RC', 'Flournoy N', 'Kosanke CW', 'Peterson DL', 'Huseby JS', 'Hudson LD', 'Storb R', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*etiology', 'Lung Volume Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Respiratory Function Tests', 'Transplantation/*adverse effects']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1984 Nov;12(10):805-10.,,"['AI 02425/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Ultimately 36 patients in the chemotherapy group and 31 in the chemoimmunotherapy group were evaluable. Six months after the last entry, immunotherapy with PSK showed a borderline beneficial effect on remission duration (P = 0.089) and on duration of survival (P = 0.062). When the data were analyzed 12, 18, and 24 months after the last entry there were no significant differences in duration of remission and survival between the two groups. However, analysis of the data of patients who had maintained complete remission for more than 270 days revealed that immunotherapy had a suggestive beneficial effect (P = 0.105), prolonging the 50% remission period by 418 days (885 vs 467 days).

The incidence of infection is related to neutropenia and is increased by the administration of cytotoxic drugs and corticosteroids; such drugs should be used cautiously in these patients. Opportunistic or unusual pathogens occur frequently in HCL, but recovery from such infections is the rule if the diagnosis is made early. Marrow hypoplasia is not infrequently seen and may present diagnostic difficulties. Such patients may have a lower tumor burden and clinically milder anemia. Hemorrhagic complications are unusual in HCL, though many patients have platelet function abnormalities. Other medical problems occur with increased frequency in HCL, and failure to recognize them leads to increased morbidity in this disease. Autoimmune disease is seen in up to one fourth of patients.

The fluorescence intensity distribution of insulin receptors on cells was determined by incubating the cells with one of three different anti-receptor antisera (human serum B-9 containing polyclonal autoantibodies, serum from a rabbit with polyclonal antibodies, and a monoclonal antibody to the receptor produced in mouse hybridomas), followed by incubation with an appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled second antibody and analysis on an Epics-V flow cytometer. All three anti-receptor antibodies specifically labeled the insulin receptors. The monoclonal antibody showed the highest level of labeling. Treatment of cells with proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin or chymotrypsin, produced a dose-dependent loss of 125I-labeled insulin (125I-insulin) binding but a relatively small decrease in the binding of anti-receptor antibodies, suggesting that most antibody binding occurred in domains other than the insulin binding site. Treatment with glycosidic enzymes, such as neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase did not affect the binding of 125I-insulin, and fluorescence was actually enhanced by about 20% in the beta-galactosidase-treated cells. Exposure of IM-9 cells to insulin resulted in a reduction in the number of insulin receptors. Analysis of the down-regulated cells by immunofluorescence revealed a complete correlation between the percent binding of 125I-insulin and percent peak fluorescence. In all cases, receptors were lost proportionally from all cells, yielding a single symmetrical peak by fluorescence analysis. Exposure of IM-9 cells to anti-receptor antibodies at 37 degrees C for 16 hr also produced a down-regulation in the number of insulin receptors. Incubation with human antiserum B-9 caused a 95% loss of both 125I-insulin binding and peak fluorescence, while the monoclonal antibody resulted in a 50% loss of receptors. Incubation of cells with anti-receptor antibodies for 2 hr at 4 degrees C did not produce any receptor loss; however, the human anti-receptor antisera B-2 and B-9 inhibited the binding of the monoclonal anti-receptor antibody by about 50%, suggesting that these antisera contained autoantibodies directed at the monoclonal antibody binding site.

The values of each receptor comprise a continuum from very low to relatively high, suggesting that previous considerations of hormone dependence on the basis of presence or absence of hormone receptors may be oversimplified.

Advances in the fields of hematology-oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, and neonatology have resulted in a marked improvement in both perinatal survival statistics, and median maternal survival. Since 1972, there have been 14 pregnancies reported in patients cured of acute lymphocytic leukemia, with 1 early spontaneous abortion and 13 term infants. All mothers survived. There have been 47 reports of pregnancy in association with acute leukemia. In 40 pregnancies in which acute leukemia was treated, there were 5 abortions, 3 perinatal demises, 1 infant ""liveborn in grave condition,"" and 31 surviving infants. Median maternal survival was at least 6, and possibly more than 12 months from delivery. In seven cases in which leukemia was untreated, there were one abortion, two perinatal demises, and four living infants; only one of six mothers survived beyond 6 months. Here, a case of pregnancy complicated by acute promyelocytic leukemia is presented. The mother was aggressively treated with combination chemotherapy. The fetus was closely monitored and delivered following a course of betamethasone at 34 weeks' gestation, and had no neonatal problems. The mother expired 13 months status-post bone marrow transplantation, 16 months after delivery. Cases of pregnancy complicated by acute leukemia reported in the period 1972-1982 are reviewed, and management is discussed in detail.

These studies provide a potentially important new approach in the treatment of certain neoplastic diseases that may be an alternative to the use of cytotoxic agents, namely, agents that induce transformed cells to terminal cell division, expression of differentiated characteristics, and loss of oncogenic properties. A strong note of caution is needed concerning the potential therapeutic role of these agents that are able to induce transformed cells to terminal differentiation. In general, it appears that inducer-sensitive transformed cell lines are blocked at a particular stage in the development of these cells. The evidence suggests that these compounds trigger certain events that then are involved in the progression of differentiation of these cells with loss of proliferative capacity. It is not known how to predict which transformed cell lines are blocked in a stage of differentiation susceptible to the inducer-mediated effects of agents as described above. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to suggest that the pursuit of studies in this area may permit researchers to determine the potential efficacy of these inducers for in vivo controlled trials with certain select types of neoplasms.","['Marks, P A', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Marks PA', 'Rifkind RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Dec 1;54(11 Suppl):2766-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2766::aid-cncr2820541424>3.0.co;2-n.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2766::aid-cncr2820541424>3.0.co;2-n [doi]'],"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0 1CA31768-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,36,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) provides a way of rescue from this toxicity. The donor may be a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) ""matched"" sibling (allogeneic), an identical twin (syngeneic), or the patient (autologous). Long remissions and possible cures of 50% to 60% have been reported in acute leukemia after intensive treatment with chemotherapy, with and without total body irradiation, followed by allogeneic BMT. A similar approach has been used in chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) and in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with encouraging results. Results are best in younger patients and those transplanted early in their disease (i.e., in the first remission for acute leukemia and in the chronic phase of the disease in CML). Solutions to major problems associated with allogeneic BMT, such as graft-versus-host disease and viral infections, are being actively pursued. Syngeneic BMT avoids some of the above problems, but relapses appear to be greater. Nevertheless, this approach has produced a significant number of cures. Autologous BMT is the newest approach, and the demonstration that marrow may be purged of residual tumor cells by immunologic or pharmacologic means has engendered enthusiasm for this area of clinical therapeutic investigation.","['Santos, G W']",['Santos GW'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Graft vs Host Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/etiology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1984 Dec 1;54(11 Suppl):2732-40. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2732::aid-cncr2820541421>3.0.co;2-a.,['10.1002/1097-0142(19841201)54:2+<2732::aid-cncr2820541421>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],"['CA-15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CAO-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,81,,,,,,,,,

Hybrids secreting antibodies reactive with HL-60 cells but unreactive with peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and further cloned. One clone was found to produce an IgG2a antibody recognizing an 85,000-dalton molecular weight surface glycoprotein, and a second clone was found to produce an IgM antibody recognizing a heat-stable determinant present on a glycolipid. We have termed these antigens Pro-Im1 and Pro-Im2, respectively (Pro for using HL-60 promyelocytes as an immunogen and Im for the presence of these antigens on immature cells). alpha Pro-Im1 and alpha Pro-Im2 were used to investigate the surface expression and tissue distribution of these two antigens. Pro-Im1 and Pro-Im2 were found to be brightly expressed on a fraction of fetal liver hematopoietic and bone marrow cells. Both antibodies mediated complement-dependent inhibition of CFU-GM, BFU-E, and CFU-GEMM formation assayed by soft agar colony and burst formation, indicating the expression of these antigens by early hematopoietic precursor cells. This was further confirmed by the induction of HL-60 cells by TPA to differentiate into more mature monocytes and macrophages, accompanied by the loss of both antigens. Pro-Im1 and Pro-Im2 were absent from peripheral blood monocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets, but Pro-Im2 was expressed on granulocytes. Both antigens were absent from thymocytes and peripheral T cells. Cytofluorographic analysis suggested their absence from peripheral blood B cells but that both were expressed on a minority of tissue B cells. Analysis of 150 cases of various myeloid and lymphoid malignancies demonstrated Pro-Im1 and Pro-Im2 expression on myeloblasts and promyelocytes from some acute myelogenous leukemias as well as some B cell malignancies, suggesting that these antigens are shared by early hematopoietic cells and a subset of B cells.","['Peng, R', 'Al-Katib, A', 'Knowles, D M 2nd', 'Lu, L', 'Broxmeyer, H', 'Tolidjian, B', 'Chiao, J W', 'Koziner, B', 'Wang, C Y']","['Peng R', 'Al-Katib A', 'Knowles DM 2nd', 'Lu L', 'Broxmeyer H', 'Tolidjian B', 'Chiao JW', 'Koziner B', 'Wang CY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C/immunology', 'Phorbol Esters']",1984/12/01 00:00,1984/12/01 00:01,['1984/12/01 00:00'],"['1984/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1984 Dec;64(6):1169-78.,['S0006-4971(20)62758-6 [pii]'],"['AL-18321/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

CsA for prophylaxis or treatment of graft-versus-host disease. Since CsA is extensively metabolized and subject to biliary elimination, CsA courses were divided according to the presence (serum bilirubin greater than 2.0 mg/dl) or absence (serum bilirubin less than or equal to 1.2 mg/dl) of hepatic dysfunction. All patients had normal renal function. Serum CsA concentrations were measured concurrently by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Serum concentration-time data were analyzed by standard nonlinear regression methods. Systemic clearance (Cls) calculated from HPLC results was higher than that derived from RIA results, regardless of hepatic function (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that results obtained by RIA overestimate CSP concentrations, presumably because of the presence of crossreactive CSP metabolites. These differences can significantly affect derived pharmacokinetic parameters. Therefore, clinicians who make dosage recommendations based on pharmacokinetic parameters should consider the effect of assay method.","['Yee, G C', 'Kennedy, M S', 'Storb, R', 'Thomas, E D']","['Yee GC', 'Kennedy MS', 'Storb R', 'Thomas ED']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Cyclosporins)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclosporins/administration & dosage/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/*therapy']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1984 Nov;38(5):511-3. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198411000-00014.,['10.1097/00007890-198411000-00014 [doi]'],"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this investigation was twofold: (1) to define the contribution of hemopoetic cells to neopterin excretion, and (2) to search for the clinical utility of this biochemical marker in the monitoring of such patients. Thirteen patients were grafted with allogeneic, 1 with syngeneic, and 2 with autologous marrow. Urinary neopterin excretion was measured daily by means of high-performance liquid chromatography from the time before transplantation until the patients' discharge from the isolation unit. In all patients bone marrow aplasia was associated with depressed, and engraftment with increased, neopterin values. Rising neopterin levels invariably preceded the cytological definition of ""take,"" on the average by seven days. After hematological reconstitution, neopterin excretion continuously declined in all 5 patients lacking infectious complications and/o-graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A transitory increase of urinary neopterin followed by normalization was observed in 5 further patients. At the time of increased neopterin excretion, 4 experienced either herpetic infection or GVHD, both of which resolved promptly under the appropriate treatment. Neopterin values remained elevated after engraftment in 6 patients who suffered from persistent GVHD. Results of this pilot study suggest that (1) bone marrow derived cells are crucially involved in production of neopterin in vivo and (2) evaluation of neopterin excretion patterns after hemopoietic reconstitution enables one to discriminate between patients with and without an increased risk of developing GVHD or viral disease.","['Niederwieser, D', 'Huber, C', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Bannert, P', 'Fuchs, D', 'Hausen, A', 'Reibnegger, G', 'Speck, B', 'Wachter, H']","['Niederwieser D', 'Huber C', 'Gratwohl A', 'Bannert P', 'Fuchs D', 'Hausen A', 'Reibnegger G', 'Speck B', 'Wachter H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Pteridines)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '670-65-5 (Neopterin)']",IM,"['Biopterin/analogs & derivatives/*urine', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/methods', 'Clinical Laboratory Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Neopterin', 'Pteridines/*urine']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1984 Nov;38(5):497-500. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198411000-00011.,['10.1097/00007890-198411000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical results and effect on circulating T lymphocytes.,469-74,"Eight recipients of a bone-marrow graft from HLA-identical, MLR-nonreactive sibling donors who had developed grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), were given 14 consecutive daily injections of 5 mg of a murine anti-T-cell monoclonal antibody (MCA) called OKT3. Four patients with grade II aGVHD showed a complete response; two patients with grade II had a partial response, and two patients (one with grade II and one with grade IV) showed no improvement at all. The main side effect was a high spiking fever after the first injection. T cells were monitored with monoclonal antibodies, indirect immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry. Circulating T3+ T cells dropped to virtually zero within 1 hr following the first injection. Low numbers of E-rosetting cells were still demonstrable during OKT3 therapy. During the second week of treatment, T-cell markers (T3, T4, T8) started to increase again, in spite of excess antibody in the circulation. At that time, T cells showed weaker fluorescence with OKT3 than before OKT3 therapy, suggesting modulation of the T3 antigen. After cessation of OKT3 therapy, T cells reached pretreatment levels within one week. None of the six patients studied developed anti-mouse-Ig antibodies. These results suggest that OKT3 therapy is effective in limited aGVHD. The absence of anti-mouse-Ig antibody formation may allow repeated courses of MCA that may add to their therapeutical potential.","['Gratama, J W', 'Jansen, J', 'Lipovich, R A', 'Tanke, H J', 'Goldstein, G', 'Zwaan, F E']","['Gratama JW', 'Jansen J', 'Lipovich RA', 'Tanke HJ', 'Goldstein G', 'Zwaan FE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1984 Nov;38(5):469-74. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198411000-00005.,['10.1097/00007890-198411000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In CP mortality was primarily age-dependent and relapses occurred in only 7%.

Longlasting cytogenetic and clinical remissions with potential for cure are possible in a high percentage of patients. The incidence of transplant-related mortality is acceptable.

In confirmation of previous results, negligible binding or internalization was observed for unstimulated cells, while activated lymphocytes showed significant insulin binding. The majority of this insulin was demonstrated to be internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis and acidified within 60 min after addition of insulin. Dual-fluorescence flow cytometry, using antibodies specific for human T cell subsets, was used to show that the expression of insulin binding sites occurs for at least some cells from both the helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor T cell subsets. Insulin internalization is not an artifact of in vitro stimulation, since more than 90% of the unstimulated lymphocytes from a patient with a helper T cell leukemia are positive for insulin internalization. The usefulness of flow cytometric analysis for measuring lymphocyte activation in unstimulated populations and the therapeutic potential of the reported findings for control of lymphocyte proliferation are discussed.","['Murphy, R F', 'Bisaccia, E', 'Cantor, C R', 'Berger, C', 'Edelson, R L']","['Murphy RF', 'Bisaccia E', 'Cantor CR', 'Berger C', 'Edelson RL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Insulin)', '0 (insulin, fluorescein-isothiocyanated-)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Flow Cytometry', '*Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Leukemia/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptor, Insulin/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1984 Nov;121(2):351-6. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041210212.,['10.1002/jcp.1041210212 [doi]'],"['GM14825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27576/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

Prediction of early relapse.,1067-73,"Previous reports have suggested that the technique of premature chromosome condensation (PCC) is useful for predicting relapse in patients with acute leukemia. However, these studies involved patients had been in complete remission (CR) for various periods of time and had heterogeneous expectations for relapse. The purpose of this study was to further determine the value of PCC in predicting relapse by examining the PCC characteristics of bone marrow specimens from patients with acute leukemia on a common therapeutic regimen after similar periods in CR. The remission durations after the PCC determinations were compared between patients with high or low proliferative potential indices (PPI, or the fraction of G1 cells in late G1 phase). Of 60 patients studied between two and eight weeks after achieving CR, 14 of the 16 patients exhibiting high PPI values (greater than or equal to 35) have relapsed. The mean time from PCC measurement to relapse was 23 weeks. In contrast, only 19 of the 44 patients exhibiting low PPI values have relapsed, with an estimated mean time to relapse of 68+ weeks. Likewise, of 38 patients studied between nine and 15 weeks of CR, nine of the ten patients exhibiting high PPI values have relapsed (mean time to relapse, 23 weeks), while only 16 of 28 patients with low PPI values have relapsed (estimated mean time to relapse, 54+ weeks). The predictive value of the PCC technique was found to be independent of other prognostic factors for the duration of CR, and it identified those patients within the poor prognostic category with a high likelihood of imminent relapse. While similar trends were observed at later time intervals in CR, the differences in relapse rate between patients with high or low PPI values is not significant. These results confirm the usefulness of the PCC technique in predicting relapse in acute leukemia and could aid in the identification of patients who might benefit by an alteration of therapeutic strategy.","['Hittelman, W N', 'Menegaz, S D', 'McCredie, K B', 'Keating, M J']","['Hittelman WN', 'Menegaz SD', 'McCredie KB', 'Keating MJ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/therapeutic use', 'Amsacrine', 'Animals', 'Cell Fusion', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Ovary/cytology', 'Prognosis']",1984/11/01 00:00,1984/11/01 00:01,['1984/11/01 00:00'],"['1984/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1984 Nov;64(5):1067-73.,['S0006-4971(20)84712-0 [pii]'],"['CA 27931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,

L-Asparaginase made in the USSR and crasnitin are recommended for wide use in clinical practice.","[""Kondrat'eva, N A""]","[""Kondrat'eva NA""]",['rus'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Sravnitel'naia otsenka klinicheskoi effektivnosti trekh preparatov L-asparaginazy iz E. coli.,Russia (Federation),Antibiotiki,Antibiotiki,0375020,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Parenteral', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antibiotiki. 1984 Jul;29(7):527-31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It decreased with age in C57BL/6 mice, whereas it increased and reached a maximum at 5 months in AKR mice. When the animals developed leukaemia, NK activity completely disappeared. A considerable increase in NK activity was observed in AKR and C57BL/6 mice which had been thymectomized at 30 days of age. This activity remained at a high level for 3 months and slowly decreased afterwards. The NK activity of C57BL/6 mice fell after sublethal irradiation (1.75 Gy X 4) and did not recover within 12 weeks, except in mice restored with bone marrow (BM). When mice were thymectomized prior to radiation exposure, NK activity remained at a normal level and BM restoration resulted in a weak but significant enhancement. NK activity, which was already low in AKR mice, was not significantly modified by sublethal irradiation, whether the animals were previously thymectomized or not. In this strain, BM restoration increased the NK activity after sublethal irradiation, and a higher level was reached in thymectomized animals than in intact ones. Lethally irradiated mice restored with bone marrow displayed a high level of NK activity, which was comparable in both strains and was augmented by thymectomy. Taken together, these results indicate that spleen NK activity is, at least in part, controlled by the thymus. The increased NK activity in thymectomized animals might result from the decline or inactivation of a thymus-dependent suppressive activity. The low NK activity observed in AKR mice seems to be related to a thymus-mediated suppressive effect rather than to a defect of BM in NK precursors.","['Vaillier, D', 'Legrand, E', 'Labat, V', 'Duplan, J F']","['Vaillier D', 'Legrand E', 'Labat V', 'Duplan JF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,France,Ann Immunol (Paris),Annales d'immunologie,0353045,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*physiology/radiation effects']",1984/07/01 00:00,1984/07/01 00:01,['1984/07/01 00:00'],"['1984/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1984/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1984/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Immunol (Paris). 1984 Jul-Aug;135D(1):1-12. doi: 10.1016/s0769-2625(84)80150-6.,['10.1016/s0769-2625(84)80150-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,
