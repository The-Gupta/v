The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the antitumor activity of bortezomib against the in vitro and in vivo childhood cancer preclinical models of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). PROCEDURES: Bortezomib was tested against the PPTP in vitro panel at concentrations ranging from 0.1 nM to 1.0 microM and was tested in vivo at a dose of 1 mg/kg for a planned duration of 6 weeks. RESULTS: Bortezomib was uniformly active against the PPTP's in vitro panel, with a median IC(50) of 23 nM and with a steep dose-response curve. The four acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines had significantly lower IC(50) values compared to the remaining lines of the in vitro panel. Limited in vivo activity was observed for bortezomib against the solid tumor xenografts tested, with one line meeting criteria for intermediate activity for the time to event measure and with the remaining lines showing low activity for this measure. Bortezomib demonstrated in vivo activity against the ALL panel, inducing two complete and two partial responses among seven evaluable lines. CONCLUSIONS: Administered at its MTD in mice, bortezomib demonstrated activity against selected lines of the PPTP's ALL in vivo panel. Further studies are indicated to determine the activity of bortezomib when combined with standard agents to treat childhood ALL.","['Houghton, Peter J', 'Morton, Christopher L', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Lock, Richard', 'Carol, Hernan', 'Reynolds, C Patrick', 'Keshelava, Nino', 'Maris, John M', 'Keir, Stephen T', 'Wu, Jianrong', 'Smith, Malcolm A']","['Houghton PJ', 'Morton CL', 'Kolb EA', 'Lock R', 'Carol H', 'Reynolds CP', 'Keshelava N', 'Maris JM', 'Keir ST', 'Wu J', 'Smith MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2007/04/11 09:00,2008/01/09 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Jan;50(1):37-45. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21214.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', '*Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",['10.1002/pbc.21214 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","[""St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA. peter.houghton@stjude.org""]",['N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the use of recombinant human haemopoietic growth factors in vitro to improve cytogenetic cultures. Using a combination of granulocyte colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor, stem cell factor, and interleukin-3, we developed an additive for bone marrow cultures intended to stimulate myeloid cell growth. Sixty-seven paired parallel cultures were analyzed, of which 50 were abnormal. The growth factor (GF) cultures showed a median four- to five-fold increase in mitotic index (MI) (P < 0.0001). In addition, the chromosome morphology was significantly improved in the GF cultures with a median increase in United Kingdom National External Quality Assessment Scheme quality score of 1.25 points (P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the number of abnormal cells between the two culture methods. The combination of higher MI and improved chromosome quality substantially reduces the time required to process a case; furthermore, the GF medium is cheaper than the medium with which it was compared. This method is suitable for both diagnostic and follow-up cytogenetic analysis of acute and chronic myeloid neoplasia and is particularly useful for poorly cellular marrow samples or blood samples that would be expected to fail on standard culture. The use of this method has enabled substantial improvements in work efficiency in our oncology cytogenetic laboratory and reduced average reporting times from 9.0 days (2004/5) to 7.1 days (2005/6), despite a 6% increase in sample numbers.","['Earle, Victoria L', 'Ross, Fiona', 'Fisher, Andrew', 'Strike, Paul', 'Berrington, Samantha', 'Chiecchio, Laura', 'Cabanas, Elisabet Dachs', 'Washbourne, Rebecca', 'Watts, Kathryn', 'Grand, Francis']","['Earle VL', 'Ross F', 'Fisher A', 'Strike P', 'Berrington S', 'Chiecchio L', 'Cabanas ED', 'Washbourne R', 'Watts K', 'Grand F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Jul;46(7):670-4. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20450.,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],IM,,"['Acute Disease', '*Chromosomes, Human', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",['10.1002/gcc.20450 [doi]'],,"['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury SP2 8BJ, UK. victoria.earle@salibury.nhs.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied cross talk among (1) the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1, FLT-1; (2) the human eag-related gene 1 (hERG1) K(+) channels; and (3) integrin receptors in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. FLT-1, hERG1, and the beta(1) integrin were found to form a macromolecular signaling complex. The latter mostly recruited the hERG1B isoform of hERG1 channels, and its assembly was necessary for FLT-1 signaling activation and AML cell migration. Both effects were inhibited when hERG1 channels were specifically blocked. A FLT-1/hERG1/beta(1) complex was also observed in primary AML blasts, obtained from a population of human patients. The co-expression of FLT-1 and hERG1 conferred a pro-migratory phenotype to AML blasts. Such a phenotype was also observed in vivo. The hERG1-positive blasts were more efficient in invading the peripheral circulation and the extramedullary sites after engraftment into immunodeficient mice. Moreover, hERG1 expression in leukemia patients correlated with a higher probability of relapse and shorter survival periods. We conclude that in AML, hERG1 channels mediate the FLT-1-dependent cell migration and invasion, and hence confer a greater malignancy.","['Pillozzi, Serena', 'Brizzi, Maria Felice', 'Bernabei, Pietro Antonio', 'Bartolozzi, Benedetta', 'Caporale, Roberto', 'Basile, Venere', 'Boddi, Vieri', 'Pegoraro, Luigi', 'Becchetti, Andrea', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa']","['Pillozzi S', 'Brizzi MF', 'Bernabei PA', 'Bartolozzi B', 'Caporale R', 'Basile V', 'Boddi V', 'Pegoraro L', 'Becchetti A', 'Arcangeli A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/09/21 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Aug 15;110(4):1238-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-02-003772.

ATRA binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and triggers the formation of the transcription coactivator complex, which leads to changes in gene expression, APL cell-cycle arrest and differentiation, and clinical remission. The mechanisms responsible for ATRA's beneficial effects are still ill-defined. Here, we conducted a large-scale, unbiased short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen aiming to identify mediators of ATRA-induced differentiation and growth arrest of APL cells. Twenty-six proteins were identified. They cover a wide range of cellular functions, including gene expression, intracellular signaling, cell death control, stress responses, and metabolic regulation, indicating the complexity of ATRA-induced cell growth control and differentiation in APL. One of these proteins, the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBE2D3, is up-regulated in ATRA-treated acute promyelocytic NB4 cells. UBE2D3 is physically associated with cyclin D1 and mediates ATRA-induced cyclin D1 degradation. Knocking down UBE2D3 by RNA interference (RNAi) leads to blockage of ATRA-induced cyclin D1 degradation and cell-cycle arrest. Thus, our results highlight the involvement of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway in ATRA-induced cell-cycle arrest and provide a novel strategy for modulating ATRA-elicited cellular effects.","['Hattori, Hidenori', 'Zhang, Xueqing', 'Jia, Yonghui', 'Subramanian, Kulandayan K', 'Jo, Hakryul', 'Loison, Fabien', 'Newburger, Peter E', 'Luo, Hongbo R']","['Hattori H', 'Zhang X', 'Jia Y', 'Subramanian KK', 'Jo H', 'Loison F', 'Newburger PE', 'Luo HR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1924478,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):640-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-059048.

EGR1 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene within the commonly deleted segment of 5q, and encodes a zinc finger transcription factor. To test the hypothesis that loss of function of Egr1 is an initiating event in the pathogenesis of AML/MDS, Egr1-deficient mice were treated with a potent DNA alkylating agent, N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU), to induce secondary cooperating mutations. Egr1(+/-) and Egr1(-/-) mice treated with ENU developed immature T-cell lymphomas (CD4(+), CD8(+)) or a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) at increased rates and with shorter latencies than that of wild-type littermates. The MPD was characterized by an elevated white blood cell count, anemia, and thrombocytopenia with ineffective erythropoiesis. Biallelic mutations of Egr1 were not observed in MPDs in Egr1(+/-) mice.

In addition to its location in the cytoplasm, Par 6 is localized to the nucleus. However, its organization and potential functions in the nucleus have not been examined. Using an affinity-purified Par 6 antibody and a chimera of Par 6 and green fluorescent protein, we show that Par 6 localizes precisely to nuclear speckles, but not to other nuclear structures, and displays characteristics of speckle proteins. We show that Par 6 colocalizes in the nucleus with Tax, a transcriptional activator of the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 long terminal repeat, but multiple lines of evidence show that Par 6 is not directly involved in known functions of speckle proteins, including general transcription, splicing, or mRNA transport. Significantly, however, the structure of nuclear speckles is lost when Par 6 levels are reduced by Par 6-specific small interfering RNA. Therefore, we hypothesize that Par 6 in the nucleus acts as a scaffolding protein in nuclear speckle complexes, similar to its role in the cytoplasm.","['Cline, Erin G', 'Nelson, W James']","['Cline EG', 'Nelson WJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC1900068,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Jun;27(12):4431-43. doi: 10.1128/MCB.02235-06.

Null genotypes of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) exhibit absence of enzymatic activity and are hypothesized to be at increased risk of developing cancers. The aim of the study was to examine whether null genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 confer susceptibility to chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). We carried a case control study involving 80 consecutive North Indian CML patients (58 males, 22 females; age (mean+/-S.D.) 36.2+/-10.9 years) and 105 healthy individuals (59 males, 46 females; age (mean+/-S.D.) 36.8+/-11.3 years). Multiplex PCR was carried out to determine the frequency of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes. The relationship between GSTM1, GSTT1 genotypes and risk of CML was assessed by means of odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence limits calculated by logistic regression. A test for trend (P(trend)) in increasing the risk of CML having more than one putative high-risk allele or genotype was evaluated by means of the chi-square test. There was no difference in the frequencies of the GSTM1 null genotype and the combined GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes between patients and controls in the study. However, statistical significance was found with GSTT1 null genotype frequency in CML patients as compared to controls (16/80 (20%) versus 9/105 (8.5%); OR=2.67, 95% CI: 1.03-7.01). It projects a 2.67-fold increased risk for CML in individuals with GSTT1 null genotype as compared to those possessing both alleles of the gene. Our findings suggest that heritable GST status may influence the risk of developing CML.","['Bajpai, Prachi', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Agrawal, Deepa']","['Bajpai P', 'Tripathi AK', 'Agrawal D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2006/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/07 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Oct;31(10):1359-63. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.02.003.

Particles were collected by high volume air samplers during summer and winter periods in three European cities (Prague, Kosice, and Sofia), representing different levels of air pollution. The genotoxic potential of extractable organic matter (EOM) was compared with the genotoxic potential of individual carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (c-PAHs) as well as their artificial mixtures. Metabolically competent human hepatoma HepG2 cells, confluent cultures of human diploid lung fibroblasts (HEL), and the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 were used as models. DNA adducts were analyzed by (32)P-postlabeling. The total DNA adduct levels induced in HepG2 cells after exposure to EOMs were higher than in HEL cells treated under the same conditions (15-190 versus 2-15adducts/10(8) nucleotides, in HepG2 and HEL cells, respectively). THP-1 cells exhibited the lowest DNA adduct forming activity induced by EOMs (1.5-3.7adducts/10(8) nucleotides). A direct correlation between total DNA adduct levels and c-PAH content in EOM was found for all EOMs in HepG2 cells incubated with 50microg EOM/ml (R=0.88; p=0.0192). This correlation was even slightly stronger when B[a]P content in EOMs and B[a]P-like adduct spots were analyzed (R=0.90; p=0.016). As THP-1 cells possess a limited metabolic capacity for most c-PAHs to form DNA reactive intermediates and are also more susceptible to toxic effects of PAHs and various EOM components, this cell line seemed to be an inappropriate system for genotoxicity studies of PAH-containing complex mixtures. The seasonal variability of genotoxic potential of extracts was stronger than variability among the three localities studied. In HepG2 cells, the highest DNA adduct levels were induced by EOM collected in Prague in the winter period, followed by Sofia and Kosice. However, in the summer sampling period, the order was quite opposite: Kosice>Sofia>Prague. When the EOM content per m(3) of air was taken into consideration in order to compare real exposures of humans to genotoxic compounds in all three localities, extracts from respirable dust particles collected in Sofia exhibited the highest genotoxicity regardless of the sampling period. The results indicate that most of DNA adducts detected in cells incubated with EOMs have their origin in low concentrations of c-PAHs representing 0.03-0.17% of EOM total mass. Finally, our results suggest that HepG2 cells have a metabolic capacity for PAHs similar to human hepatocytes and represent therefore the best in vitro model for investigating the genotoxic potential of complex mixtures containing PAHs among the three cell lines tested in this study.","['Sevastyanova, O', 'Binkova, B', 'Topinka, J', 'Sram, R J', 'Kalina, I', 'Popov, T', 'Novakova, Z', 'Farmer, P B']","['Sevastyanova O', 'Binkova B', 'Topinka J', 'Sram RJ', 'Kalina I', 'Popov T', 'Novakova Z', 'Farmer PB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 Jul 1;620(1-2):123-34. doi: 10.1016/j.mrfmmm.2007.03.002.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), acute or chronic, attacking host tissue is a major threat. However, donor immunocompetent T cells have a potent graft-versus-leukemia effect. A combination of calcineurin inhibitors and methotrexate is the standard therapy to prevent GVHD. Modulation of the immunosuppressive regimen may induce mild acute and mild chronic GVHD, reduce the risk of relapse, and improve long-term survival. Natural killer cells also play a role in this context. Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor incompatibility between recipient and donor may reduce the risk of relapse in patients with myeloid leukemia. Relapse of leukemia is a major cause of death after ASCT. Minimal residual disease and recipient leukemia lineage-specific chimerism are sensitive techniques for early detection of leukemic relapse. Donor lymphocyte infusions can enhance the antitumor effect, especially for patients with molecular relapse. The allogeneic graft-versus-cancer effect has been demonstrated in patients with metastatic breast, renal, colorectal, ovarian, prostatic, and pancreatic carcinoma. Mesenchymal stem cells have immunomodulatory properties and may be used for immunomodulation of GVHD and tissue repair.

Except for cytogenetics, no clinical parameter was shown to be significantly associated with outcome. The analysis of individual cytogenetic subgroups demonstrated that aberrations involving chromosome 16q were the strongest predictor of a good prognosis, while +8 and complex karyotypes represented the strongest predictors of a poor prognosis.

While GVHD is often associated with the beneficial graft vs. tumour effect, it also contributes towards significant morbidity and mortality. No reliably effective treatment has yet been established. We present 10 patients with haematological malignancies who underwent an allogeneic stem cell transplant and developed sclerodermatous GVHD. Donor lymphocyte infusion administered for relapse or reducing donor T-cell chimerism was a known trigger for sclerodermatous GVHD in four of the patients. Treatment with immunosuppressants, psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) and extracorporeal photopheresis has been largely unsuccessful in their management. Intensive immunosuppression including the use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody may have contributed to relapse of leukaemia in one patient 10 years after her transplant. Sclerodermatous GVHD may occur without a preceding lichenoid stage. Clinical heterogeneity is common, although sclerodermatous GVHD has a predilection for the limbs. Treatment options are largely unsatisfactory if conventional immunosuppression fails. PUVA may give some symptomatic benefit and extracorporeal photopheresis seems to be less efficacious than previously published work suggests.","['White, J M L', 'Creamer, D', 'du Vivier, A W P', 'Pagliuca, A', 'Ho, A Y', 'Devereux, S', 'Salisbury, J R', 'Mufti, G J']","['White JM', 'Creamer D', 'du Vivier AW', 'Pagliuca A', 'Ho AY', 'Devereux S', 'Salisbury JR', 'Mufti GJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/09/06 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2007 May;156(5):1032-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2007.07827.x.

A candidate compartment for these events is the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear domain (PML-ND), within which are found numerous effectors of damage recognition, repair, and cell death. We predicted that the identification of PML-ND cargo proteins would clarify those biochemical pathways that straddle the recognition of cellular damage and cell fate. We now use mass spectrometry of peptides eluted from PML coprecipitates to demonstrate that the gamma 1 (gamma1) isoform of PLC associates with nuclear PML. Though thought to act primarily in the cytoplasm, we use biochemical fractionation combined with immunocytochemistry to verify the nuclear expression of PLC-gamma1 and its interaction with PML. These are the first data to show an interaction between endogenous levels of a phosphoinositide metabolizing protein and the biophysically labile PML-ND by mass spectrometry and add weight to the view that PML-NDs may act as tumor suppressors by sequestering mitogenic effectors.","['Ferguson, Brian J', 'Dovey, Claire L', 'Lilley, Kathryn', 'Wyllie, Andrew H', 'Rich, Tina']","['Ferguson BJ', 'Dovey CL', 'Lilley K', 'Wyllie AH', 'Rich T']",['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Proteome Res,Journal of proteome research,101128775,,2007/04/11 09:00,2007/07/25 09:00,['2007/04/11 09:00'],"['2007/04/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/11 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Proteome Res. 2007 May;6(5):2027-32. doi: 10.1021/pr060684v.

We also show that the cytosolic portion of VDR in leukemia cells is localized in the vicinity of the plasma membrane, close to the F-actin cytoskeleton.","['Gocek, Elzbieta', 'Kielbinski, Marek', 'Marcinkowska, Ewa']","['Gocek E', 'Kielbinski M', 'Marcinkowska E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2007 May 1;581(9):1751-7. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.03.055.

However, the molecular mechanism of the Tax-induced NFkappaB activation remains unknown. One of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinses (MAP3Ks) members, TAK1, plays a critical role in cytokine-induced activation of NFkappaB, which involves lysine 63-linked (K63) polyubiquitination of NEMO, a noncatalytic subunit of the IkappaB kinase complex. Here we show that Tax induces K63 polyubiquitination of NEMO. However, TAK1 is dispensable for Tax-induced NFkappaB activation, and deubiquitination of the K63 polyubiquitin chain failed to block Tax-induced NFkappaB activation. In addition, silencing of other MAP3Ks, including MEKK1, MEKK3, NIK, and TPL-2, did not affect Tax-induced NFkappaB activation. These results strongly suggest that unlike cytokine signaling, Tax-induced NFkappaB activation does not involve K63 polyubiquitination-mediated MAP3K activation.","['Gohda, Jin', 'Irisawa, Masato', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Sato, Shintaro', 'Ohtani, Kiyoshi', 'Fujisawa, Jun-ichi', 'Inoue, Jun-ichiro']","['Gohda J', 'Irisawa M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sato S', 'Ohtani K', 'Fujisawa J', 'Inoue J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 May 25;357(1):225-30. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.125.

Smudge cells are CLL cells ruptured during smear preparation. We hypothesized that smudge cell formation is inversely correlated with expression of vimentin, a cytoskeletal protein and prognostic marker, and that the percentage of smudge cells would predict prognosis in CLL. We reviewed the blood smears of 75 patients with previously untreated early and intermediate-stage CLL (Rai stage 0-II) who were seen at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn, between September 1989 and December 2000. A total of 200 lymphocytes and smudge cells were counted on each slide and the results expressed as a percentage of the total lymphocytes (intact and smudged). The median percentage of smudge cells was 27% (range, 4%-72%). The percentage of smudge cells inversely correlated with vimentin expression (r=-0.57; P=.007). The median percentage of smudge cells was higher in patients with the mutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene than in those with the unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (31% vs 13%; P=.02). Patients with less than 30% smudge cells had a median time from diagnosis to initial treatment of 72.7 months, whereas the median time from diagnosis to initial treatment in patients with 30% or more smudge cells was not reached (P=.001). The percentage of smudge cells as a continuous variable correlated with overall survival (P=.04).

Recently, centrosome aberrations have been described as a possible cause of chromosomal instability and aneuploidy in many human malignancies. To investigate whether centrosome aberrations do occur in CLL and whether they correlate with common prognostic factors and disease activity, we examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 70 patients with previously untreated CLL using an antibody to gamma-tubulin. All 70 CLL samples displayed significantly more cells with centrosome aberrations (median: 26.0%, range 11.0-41.5%) as compared to peripheral blood B lymphocytes from 20 age-matched, healthy individuals (median: 2.0%, range 0-6%; p < 0.001). The extent of centrosome aberrations correlated with the proliferative activity of the CLL cases as measured by lymphocyte doubling time (p = 0.02) as well as with time to first treatment (p = 0.05). Accordingly, more centrosome aberrations were found in PHA-stimulated T lymphocytes from healthy individuals as well as in B cells from surgically removed tonsil tissue of patients with acute tonsillitis as compared to the peripheral blood B lymphocytes from the control group. In contrast, no correlation was observed between centrosome aberrations and immunoglobulin VH gene mutation status or cytogenetically defined risk groups. These findings suggest that, despite the common observation of most CLL cells remaining in G(0)/G(1) phase, their centrosome replication process is deregulated and correlates to the proliferative activity of CLL cells.","['Hensel, Manfred', 'Zoz, Martin', 'Giesecke, Christian', 'Benner, Axel', 'Neben, Kai', 'Jauch, Anna', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Kramer, Alwin']","['Hensel M', 'Zoz M', 'Giesecke C', 'Benner A', 'Neben K', 'Jauch A', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Ho AD', 'Kramer A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2007 Sep 1;121(5):978-83. doi: 10.1002/ijc.22752.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Proliferation', '*Centrosome', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",['10.1002/ijc.22752 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

During the investigation of pyrexia evidence of N. farcinica infection was found in the bronchial secretions. The second case was a man of 61 receiving long term corticosteroids and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Investigation of a pneumonia with pleural effusion found evidence, on culture of blood and pleural fluid, of disseminated infection with N. nova (cerebral, pleural, pulmonary and splenic). CONCLUSION: Nocardiosis is a rare cause of pneumonia mainly occurring in immuno-compromised adults (corticosteroid therapy, HIV infection, transplantation, cancer or leukaemia).

It currently relies on either the use of recombinant cytokines or transfer of transcription factor genes. Among these, the HOXB4 homeoprotein is of particular interest since it promotes the expansion of mouse HSCs without inducing leukemia. To prevent potential deleterious side effects associated with stable HOXB4 gene transfer into the cells, we took advantage of the ability of homeoproteins to passively pass through cell membranes. We have shown that, when co-cultured with stromal cells engineered to secrete HOXB4, human stem cells and immature progenitors clearly were expanded. This expansion was associated with enhanced stem cell repopulating capacity in vivo and maintenance of pluripotentiality. The role that HOXB4 plays on stem cell expansion has also been tested on human lymphoid progenitors. We found that our model of protein transfer was also able to induce the expansion of the immature lympho-myeloid and pro-T/NK progenitors as well as of more mature NK progenitors. We then looked for synergistic activities between HOXB4 and other homeoproteins such as HOXC4. We found that HOXC4 was able to promote the expansion of human hematopoietic cells in vitro roughly as HOXB4 did and that the presence of both HOXB4 and HOXC4 molecules induced even higher expansion levels of these cells. Our method provides a basis for developing cell therapy strategies using expanded HSCs that are not genetically modified.","['Amsellem, Sophie', 'Fichelson, Serge']","['Amsellem S', 'Fichelson S']",['fre'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,J Soc Biol,Journal de la Societe de biologie,100890617,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Soc Biol. 2006;200(3):235-41. doi: 10.1051/jbio:2006027.,"['0 (HOXB4 protein, human)', '0 (HOXC4 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/metabolism/virology', 'Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lentivirus/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic']","['MDOI-JSB-10-2006-200-3-ENCOURS-101019-200610005 [pii]', '10.1051/jbio:2006027 [doi]']",,"[""Institut Cochin, Departement d'Hematologie, Inserm U567, CNRS UMR 8104, Universite Paris 5, Faculte de Medecine Rene Descartes, UM 3.

In order to identify these novel proteins, we have developed a proteomics methodology using purified plasma membranes prepared from human leukemic cells.","['Boyd, Robert S', 'Dyer, Martin J S', 'Cain, Kelvin']","['Boyd RS', 'Dyer MJ', 'Cain K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,2007/04/10 09:00,2008/07/03 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2007;370:135-46. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-353-0_11.,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'Proteomics/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['1-59745-353-6:135 [pii]', '10.1007/978-1-59745-353-0_11 [doi]']",,"['Proteomics Facility, MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to their unique morphology and antimicrobial activity, neutrophils are characterized by the ability to migrate rapidly up shallow gradients of attractants in vivo. The directed migration of neutrophils, referred to as chemotaxis, requires the temporal and spatial regulation of intracellular signaling pathways allowing the neutrophil to detect a gradient of attractant, polarize, and migrate rapidly toward the highest concentration of the chemoattractant. A challenge to understanding neutrophil chemotaxis is the inherent difficulty encountered when working with primary neutrophils, which are difficult to purify in the resting state, are not easily transfected, are terminally differentiated, and have a short life span after purification. Here we discuss neutrophil purification methods and chemotaxis assays and provide methodology for working with a neutrophil-like cell line, the HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line. We also discuss methods for HL-60 transfection using retroviral approaches and chemotaxis assays used with differentiated HL-60 cells.","['Nuzzi, Paul A', 'Lokuta, Mary A', 'Huttenlocher, Anna']","['Nuzzi PA', 'Lokuta MA', 'Huttenlocher A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,,2007/04/10 09:00,2008/07/03 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2007;370:23-36. doi: 10.1007/978-1-59745-353-0_3.,,IM,,"['Cell Separation/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/cytology/*physiology']","['1-59745-353-6:23 [pii]', '10.1007/978-1-59745-353-0_3 [doi]']",,"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison, WI, USA.']",['R01 GM074827/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the in vitro effects of Decitabine and two structurally unrelated HDAC inhibitors (Sodium 4-phenyl butyrate, Tricostatin A) on clonogenic AML cells. Based on morphological criteria we identified four major colony types: (i) non-erythroid colonies, (ii) erythroid colonies that were detected only for a subset of patients and could be further sub classified into mature and immature forms, and (iii) intermediate colonies. Erythroid differentiation was associated with low CD34 expression. The colonies showed differences in morphology, viability, cell cycle distribution and expression of differentiation markers. Both Decitabine and the two HDAC inhibitors altered AML cell expression of differentiation markers, whereas the drugs did not have any major influence on cell cycle distribution. However, the pharmacological effects differed between the four colony subsets, and differences were also detected between the two HDAC inhibitors. We conclude that clonogenic AML cells can be classified into well-defined subsets based on their differentiation, and these subsets differ in their biological characteristics as well as their response to pharmacological targeting of epigenetic regulation.","['Ryningen, Anita', 'Stapnes, Camilla', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Ryningen A', 'Stapnes C', 'Bruserud O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/04/10 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2007/04/10 09:00'],"['2006/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/24 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Sep;31(9):1303-13. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.01.019.

After U937 cells was treated with EKI-785, an irreversible specific inhibitor of erbBs, the growth was assessed by MTT and growth curve, apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit, and signal pathway was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: erbB2-4 were expressed in U937 cell line, but not erbB1. Especially, protein of erbB2 was expressed in this cell line. After treating with EKI-785, the growth of U937 cells was inhibited and early apoptosis was induced. Moreover, the Ras/MAPK and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were all blocked.

The rapid expansion of BMT reflects its increasingly important role in the treatment of several life-threatening diseases of the hemopoietic system. The first BMT in human patients was performed after conditioning with total body irradiation (TBI). As an important part of BMT protocols, TBI has an established role in many preparative regimens used before BMT in the treatment of hematological diseases. Historically, TBI schedules varied during the last 30-year period with regard to different radiation source used, treatment technique, beam modifiers, actually delivered total dose, dose rate, and fractionation schedule. The aim of this review article is to discuss the 50- year experience in the field of TBI, as well as radiobiological, technical and dosimetric requirements and especially effects of total dose, dose rate and fractionation schedules on the prognosis of transplanted patients. The radiobiological and radio-oncological requirements demand special TBI treatment techniques quite different from usual radiotherapy. The technique needed depends extremely on the prescribed values of treatment parameters and on the local technical possibilities. TBI dosimetry has to account for the physical situation of treatment with very large field sizes at extended distances and should be performed under TBI conditions close to the real treatment situation. The effects of total dose, dose rate, fractionation schedule on the leukemia cell killing, immunosuppression, and sparing of normal tissues are considered in detail. Their effects on overall survival, leukemia recurrence, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD), late radiation-induced injuries to normal tissues or organs as well as incidence of interstitial pneumonitis, renal dysfunction and cataract development are analyzed. The definition of currently used TBI procedures is so different in different centers that retrospective analyses remain futile, under better definition and normalization of dose, fraction size, and endpoints occur. There are a lot of difficulties to evaluate, compare or understand clinical RESULTS from so different treatment regimens, often with an irregular set of parameters. In order to establish clinical trials and to evaluate clinical RESULTS, we need comparable schedules, uniform specification, and complete reporting of all relevant parameters. After 50-year experience in the field of TBI, we are beginning to understand the relationship of TBI dose, dose rate and fractionation. However, 20 years after Glasgow we will repeat his persuasion that, however, many questions remain unanswered.","['Gocheva, L']",['Gocheva L'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/04/07 09:01,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/07 09:01 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J BUON. 2004 Apr-Jun;9(2):147-60.,,,,,,,"['Department of Radiotherapy, Medical University Hospital, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine models suggest that gut toxicity, induced by the intensive chemotherapy preceding hematopoietic stem cell infusion, aggravates systemic GVHD. In HSCT patients gut toxicity correlates with chemotherapy intensity. The present study investigates acute GVHD severity and intestinal toxicity in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In 38 patients intestinal permeability was assessed before and after chemotherapy (on days -1, +4, +7 and +14 as related to the stem cell infusion). Cumulative acute GVHD (days 0-100) and clinical intestinal toxicity (days 0-14) were evaluated in parallel. Patients with mild, acute GVHD (grades 0-I) had better-preserved intestinal barrier function (P=0.04) and less pronounced cumulative clinical intestinal toxicity (P=0.02) compared with patients with more severe acute GVHD (grades II-IV). Gut toxicity predicts acute GVHD severity. Therefore, gut protective strategies may diminish GVHD severity in allogeneic HSCT patients.","['Johansson, Jan-Erik', 'Ekman, Tor']","['Johansson JE', 'Ekman T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dig Dis Sci,Digestive diseases and sciences,7902782,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2005/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dig Dis Sci. 2007 Sep;52(9):2340-5. doi: 10.1007/s10620-006-9404-x.

In the current study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of LY293111-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Two human pancreatic cancer cell lines were used in this study, MiaPaCa-2 and AsPC-1. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry showed a dramatic increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells as well as S-phase arrest after treatment with 250 nmol/l LY293111 for up to 48 h. Western blotting indicated that LY293111 treatment induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondria into the cytosol, accompanied by caspase-9, caspase-7 and caspase-3 activation, and cleavage of poly ADP-ribose polymerase. Caspase-8 was not activated by LY293111. A decrease was found in the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, and an increase in the proapoptotic protein, Bax. LY293111 reduced the expression of CDK2, cyclin A and cyclin E, consistent with the S-phase arrest observed in these cells. The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21 and p27 was not affected by LY293111 treatment. In conclusion, LY293111 induces apoptosis in human pancreatic cancer cells through the mitochondria-mediated pathway. LY293111 also induces S-phase arrest with downregulation of CDK2, cyclin A and cyclin E. Blockade of leukotriene B4 metabolic pathway may provide a novel treatment for human pancreatic cancer.","['Tong, Wei-Gang', 'Ding, Xian-Zhong', 'Talamonti, Mark S', 'Bell, Richard H', 'Adrian, Thomas E']","['Tong WG', 'Ding XZ', 'Talamonti MS', 'Bell RH', 'Adrian TE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2007 Jun;18(5):535-41. doi: 10.1097/01.cad.0000231477.22901.8a.,"['0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (LY 293111)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Leukotriene B4)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzoates/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspase 7/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin A/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin E/biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukotriene Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Receptors, Leukotriene B4/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'S Phase/*drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/biosynthesis']","['10.1097/01.cad.0000231477.22901.8a [doi]', '00001813-200706000-00003 [pii]']",,"['Department of Surgery, Robert H.

Despite these successes in the last 2 decades, 15% to 25% of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients relapse. Therefore, better dosing therapies are still needed. Insights in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) contributions of licensed drugs may guide us into better protocol design and optimal use of existing combination drug regimens. Currently, 3 asparaginase formulations are available in the United States, Escherichia coli native asparaginase (ASNase), Pegaspargase, and Erwinase. On the basis of these clinical studies, PK and PD population modeling (NONMEM) have been used to delve into new insights as to the optimal dose, formulation, and time intervals of ASNases that may be used in future clinical trials. Pegaspargase 2500 IU/m2 Q2week dosing seems to be the ""golden standard"" as far as being safe and effective. Lower doses of this formulation Qweek may achieve better PK ""steady-state"" profiles in serum. Native E. coli or Erwinia ASNase at 6000 IU/m2 showed inferior PK parameters (peak, trough, and area under the curve) than Pegaspargase. Assuming linear handling of ASNase modeling, simulations of higher doses of these ASNase formulations on a daily or Q48 hours regimen are showing bioequivalency with Pegaspargase PK-PD parameters. Future clinical trial designs may prove these efforts useful.","['Avramis, Vassilios I', 'Spence, Susan A']","['Avramis VI', 'Spence SA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Apr;29(4):239-47. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e318047b79d.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e318047b79d [doi]', '00043426-200704000-00007 [pii]']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USC Keck School of Medicine, CA 90026, USA. vavramis@chla.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A mechanistic understanding of stress erythropoiesis would benefit multiple clinical settings, and may aid in understanding leukemogenesis. RECENT FINDINGS: The spectrum of progenitors targeted by the erythropoietin receptor is broader during stress than during baseline erythropoiesis. Further, the requirement for erythropoietin receptor signaling is more stringent during stress. However, erythropoietin receptor signaling has been mostly studied in vitro, where it is difficult to relate signaling events to stress-dependent changes in erythroid homeostasis. Here we review advances in flow cytometry that allow the identification and study of murine erythroid precursors in hematopoietic tissue as they are responding to stress in vivo. The death receptor Fas and its ligand, FasL, are coexpressed by early splenic erythroblasts, suppressing erythroblast survival and erythropoietic rate. During stress, erythropoietin receptor signaling downregulates erythroblast Fas and FasL, consequently increasing erythropoietic rate. SUMMARY: Erythropoietic rate is regulated at least in part through the erythropoietin receptor-mediated survival of splenic early erythroblasts. Future research will delineate how multiple antiapoptotic pathways, potentially activated by the erythropoietin receptor, interact to produce the remarkable dynamic range of erythropoiesis.","['Socolovsky, Merav']",['Socolovsky M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/05/17 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2007 May;14(3):215-24. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0b013e3280de2bf1.,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/physiology', '*Stress, Physiological']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e3280de2bf1 [doi]', '00062752-200705000-00007 [pii]']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01605, USA. merav.socolovsky@umassmed.edu']",['R01 HL084168-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on the clinical and imaging records of 27 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of orbital leukemic tumors. The following data were extracted from the patients' records: age at diagnosis of orbital leukemic tumors, sex, race, national origin, type of leukemia, temporal relationship of orbital disease to diagnosis of leukemia, survival from diagnosis of orbital leukemic tumor, laterality of the orbital disease, location of the mass within the orbit, imaging features of the mass, chemotherapeutic protocol, treatment with bone marrow transplant, and orbital radiation. RESULTS: The median age at diagnosis of orbital leukemic tumor was 8 years (range, 1-18 years). Nineteen of the 27 patients were male, and 21 patients were born and lived in the United States. Twenty-one patients had acute myeloid leukemia, five had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one had chronic myelogenous leukemia. In 85% of patients (n = 23), the diagnosis of leukemia was based on the bone marrow examination findings. Orbital imaging revealed homogenous masses that molded to one or more orbital walls without bony destruction. Nine patients had bilateral orbital involvement. All patients received multiagent systemic chemotherapy, and 14 underwent bone marrow transplantation. Five patients received external beam radiation for the treatment of orbital disease. Fifteen (55.6%) of the 27 patients were alive at the time of the study. The median survival for all patients was 4.75 years (range, 0.1-24 years) after the diagnosis of orbital disease. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital leukemic tumors occur most commonly in the first decade of life, in association with acute myeloid leukemia. They appear as homogenous masses along the orbital walls. Although the overall survival rate for patients with leukemia has improved over the past 3 decades, the mortality of patients who develop orbital leukemic tumors remains high.","['Bidar, Maziar', 'Wilson, Matthew W', 'Laquis, Steven J', 'Wilson, Terry D', 'Fleming, James C', 'Wesley, Ralph E', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Haik, Barrett G']","['Bidar M', 'Wilson MW', 'Laquis SJ', 'Wilson TD', 'Fleming JC', 'Wesley RE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Haik BG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2007 Mar-Apr;23(2):87-93. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0b013e3180333a85.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']","['10.1097/IOP.0b013e3180333a85 [doi]', '00002341-200703000-00002 [pii]']",,"[""Department of Surgery, Division of Ophthalmology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]","['CA 57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether eradication of CML after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) was influenced by PR3 and ELA2 gene expression or PR1-specific CTL responses, we studied cells from 87 CML patients and 27 HLA-A*0201(+) donors collected prior to T-cell-depleted HLA-identical sibling SCT. For patients in advanced phase (AdP), a higher expression of both PR3 and ELA2 in CD34(+) progenitors before SCT was associated with a lower incidence of relapse-related death, improved leukemia-free survival (LFS), and overall survival (OS); in chronic phase patients, no differences were observed. PR1-CTL responses were detected in 7 of 27 HLA-identical sibling donors, and associated with improved LFS and OS after SCT on follow-up. PR1-CTL responses detected in 7 of 28 CML patients before transplantation were not predictive of outcome and correlated inversely with PR3 and ELA2 expression. These findings suggest that assessment of PR3 and ELA2 expression in leukemic progenitors is useful for predicting posttransplantation outcome in AdP patients undergoing SCT. The presence of a donor immune response against PR1 may be advantageous and could be exploited therapeutically.","['Yong, Agnes S M', 'Rezvani, Katayoun', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Eniafe, Rhoda', 'Mielke, Stephan', 'Goldman, John M', 'Barrett, A John']","['Yong AS', 'Rezvani K', 'Savani BN', 'Eniafe R', 'Mielke S', 'Goldman JM', 'Barrett AJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1924474,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):770-5. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-02-071738.

The diagnosis can be challenging since there is a wide set of alternative diagnoses, including opportunistic infections and relapse of the leukaemia. CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year old girl presented with a severe acute myelopathy and encephalopathy. She was in prolonged remission from a central nervous system and bone marrow relapse of an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, treated with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Neuroimaging showed multifocal grey and white matter lesions of demyelinating appearance in the brain and entire spine. Immunophenotyping and cytogenetic investigations of the girl's cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis excluded a late central nervous system relapse of her leukaemia. The diagnosis was acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. With standard immunosuppressive therapy, the girl had early cerebral recovery but a prolonged period of recovery from her myelopathy. CONCLUSION: Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute encephalomyelopathy after bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia. Demyelinating syndromes such as acute disseminated encephalomyelitis may be late sequelae of bone marrow transplantation.","['Kumar, Ram', 'Nijalingappa, Shobha', 'Grainger, John', 'Ismayl, Omar']","['Kumar R', 'Nijalingappa S', 'Grainger J', 'Ismayl O']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,PMC1839762,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/04/07 09:01,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/07 09:01 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2007 Feb 9;1:4. doi: 10.1186/1752-1947-1-4.,,,,,"['1752-1947-1-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-1947-1-4 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Paediatric Neurology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Hospital Road, Manchester, UK. kumarr1@doctors.org.uk.""]",,,20070209,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarities of Ordered Gene Lists (SOGL) is a recently proposed approach to meta-analysis suitable for identifying features shared by two data sets. Here we extend the idea of SOGL to the detection of significant prognostic marker genes from microarrays of multiple data sets. Three data sets for leukemia and the other six for different solid tumors are used to demonstrate our method, using established statistical techniques. RESULTS: We describe a set of significantly similar ordered gene lists, representing outcome comparisons for distinct types of cancer. This kind of similarity could improve the diagnostic accuracies of individual studies when SOGL is incorporated into the support vector machine algorithm. In particular, we investigate the similarities among three ordered gene lists pertaining to mesothelioma survival, prostate recurrence and glioma survival. The similarity-driving genes are related to the outcomes of patients with lung cancer with a hazard ratio of 4.47 (p = 0.035). Many of these genes are involved in breakdown of EMC proteins regulating angiogenesis, and may be used for further research on prognostic markers and molecular targets of gene therapy for cancers. CONCLUSION: The proposed method and its application show the potential of such meta-analyses in clinical studies of gene expression profiles.","['Yang, Xinan', 'Sun, Xiao']","['Yang X', 'Sun X']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC1853113,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2006/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 Apr 6;8:118. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-8-118.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Databases, Protein', 'Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval/methods', '*Meta-Analysis as Topic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods', 'Prognosis']","['1471-2105-8-118 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-8-118 [doi]']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Bioelectronics, Southeast University, Nanjing, PR China. xnyang@seu.edu.cn']",,,20070406,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, LIF activates the Jak/Stat signaling pathway with which many viruses, including HIV-1, interfere. We used CXCR4 and the LIF signaling receptor (gp130)-expressing cMAGI cells transfected with CD4, CCR5, and HIV-LTR-beta-galactosidase as a model system to investigate the potential involvement of Stat proteins in the anti-HIV-1 effect of LIF. Pretreatment with recombinant human (rh)LIF resulted in a significantly reduced uptake of HIV-1(BaL) , HIV-1(LAI), and SIVmac251 viral particles without affecting uptake of murine leukemia retroviral particles. HIV-1(BaL), HIV-1(LAI), as well as rhLIF selectively induced phosphorylation of Stat 3 but not Stat 1 or Stat 5. However, treatment of cMAGI cells with rhLIF prior to HIV-1 infection downregulated the HIV-1-mediated Stat 3 phosphorylation. In addition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) transfected with Stat 3 siRNA prior to HIV-1(LAI) or HIV-1(BaL) infection produced significantly less HIV-1 p24 antigen as compared to nontransfected HIV-1(LAI) and HIV-1(BaL)-infected PBMCs. Thus, the Jak/Stat signaling pathway is important for the HIV-1 replication life cycle and rhLIF excerts its anti-HIV-1 activity by disrupting this signaling cascade.","['Tjernlund, Annelie', 'Walther-Jallow, Lilian', 'Behbahani, Homira', 'Screpanti, Valentina', 'Nowak, Piotr', 'Grandien, Alf', 'Andersson, Jan', 'Patterson, Bruce K']","['Tjernlund A', 'Walther-Jallow L', 'Behbahani H', 'Screpanti V', 'Nowak P', 'Grandien A', 'Andersson J', 'Patterson BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 2007 Mar;23(3):398-406. doi: 10.1089/aid.2006.0100.,"['0 (HIV Core Protein p24)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'HIV Core Protein p24/metabolism', 'HIV Infections/*immunology', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*virology', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication/*immunology/*physiology']",['10.1089/aid.2006.0100 [doi]'],,"['Center for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

We report here studies designed to identify the minimal chicken hypersensitive site-4 (cHS4) sequences necessary for this activity. Using a gammaretroviral reporter vector and expression analysis in cell lines and primary mouse hematopoietic progenitor colonies, we found that a 250-bp core fragment reported to contain most of the cHS4 insulating activity failed to prevent silencing when used alone, although some barrier activity was observed when this fragment was combined with a 790-bp, but not 596-bp, spacer. Similar studies showed that four copies of a 90-bp fragment containing the cHS4 enhancer-blocking activity actually repressed vector green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. In contrast, a 400-bp fragment containing the 250-bp core plus 3' flanking sequences protected vector expression to the same degree as the full-length 1.2-kb fragment. The 400-bp fragment activity was confirmed in a lentiviral vector expressing human beta-globin in murine erythroid leukemia (MEL) cells. Taken together, these studies indicate that the insulating activity of the 250-bp cHS4 core can be influenced by distance, and identify an extended core element that confers full barrier activity in the setting of two different classes of retroviral vectors.","['Aker, Mari', 'Tubb, Julie', 'Groth, Amy C', 'Bukovsky, Anatoly A', 'Bell, Adam C', 'Felsenfeld, Gary', 'Kiem, Hans-Peter', 'Stamatoyannopoulos, George', 'Emery, David W']","['Aker M', 'Tubb J', 'Groth AC', 'Bukovsky AA', 'Bell AC', 'Felsenfeld G', 'Kiem HP', 'Stamatoyannopoulos G', 'Emery DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,,2007/04/07 09:00,2007/06/20 09:00,['2007/04/07 09:00'],"['2007/04/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2007 Apr;18(4):333-43. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.021.,"['147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/genetics', '*Gene Silencing', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Globins/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Insulator Elements/*genetics', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Transduction, Genetic']",['10.1089/hum.2007.021 [doi]'],,"['Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the cell-based assay TARDIS, the dietary flavonoids genistein (1) and luteolin (2) have been evaluated as topo I and topo II poisons and catalytic inhibitors in K562 leukemia cells. Both flavonoids induced topo II-DNA complexes, but they did not induce significant levels of topo I-DNA complexes. Genistein decreased the topo II-DNA complexes induced by the topo II poison etoposide, suggestive of a catalytic inhibition of topo II, and luteolin decreased the topo I-DNA complexes induced by the topo I poison camptothecin, indicative of a catalytic inhibition of topo I. Murine transgenic cells lacking topo II beta were resistant to genistein-induced cell growth inhibition (XTT assays) and cytotoxicity (clonogenic assay). High levels of topo II beta-DNA complexes were also observed in K562 cells exposed to genistein. These data suggest that topo II beta has an important function in genistein-induced cell growth inhibition and cell death.

However, the modest treatment effect encourages studies on novel therapeutic molecules, delivery systems and combination therapies. Full-length TRAIL, delivered from an adenoviral vector (Ad-hTRAIL), was studied in combination with DTIC or the histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in human melanoma cell lines. METHODS: The cytotoxic potential of the combination treatments was assessed by cell viability measurements and CalcuSyn analysis. Involvement of apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining, mitochondrial membrane potential measurements, and activation and expression levels of caspases and other mediators of apoptosis. RESULTS: Ad-hTRAIL in combination with DTIC or SAHA resulted in additive or synergistic growth inhibition compared to each treatment used as single agent. Both combinations augmented apoptosis, which was mediated through the death receptor (DR) pathway by enhanced activation of caspase-8, and through increased loss of mitochondrial integrity. Provoked cleavage of Bid, which bridges the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways, and downregulation of the anti-apoptotic mediators Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1 and XIAP (but not Bcl-2) were critical contributing factors. Increased levels of DR4 and DR5 were not a common underlying mechanism as DTIC did not affect the levels of either of the receptors. However, SAHA-induced expression of DR4 may have reduced the TRAIL resistance in the SKMEL-28 cell line. CONCLUSION: Administration of Ad-hTRAIL in combination with DTIC or SAHA enhances apoptosis in human melanoma cell lines, and suggests that the therapeutic potential of such treatment strategies should be further evaluated for possible clinical use.","['Lillehammer, Trine', 'Engesaeter, Birgit O', 'Prasmickaite, Lina', 'Maelandsmo, Gunhild M', 'Fodstad, Oystein', 'Engebraaten, Olav']","['Lillehammer T', 'Engesaeter BO', 'Prasmickaite L', 'Maelandsmo GM', 'Fodstad O', 'Engebraaten O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gene Med. 2007 Jun;9(6):440-51. doi: 10.1002/jgm.1036.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Melanoma/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Vorinostat', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",['10.1002/jgm.1036 [doi]'],,"['Department of Tumor Biology, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet Medical Center, Montebello, Oslo, Norway. trinelil@rr-research.no']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further characterize the biological features of this disease, we performed IgVH gene mutational status, FISH and high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization (HR-CGH) analysis in 17 cases of CLL/PL. All CLL/PL utilized members of VH1, VH3 and VH4 families, with the highest prevalence of the VH1-69 gene. In all but one cases analyzed, the VH genes were unmutated. The FISH and HR-CGH analyses showed frequent occurrence of trisomy 12, del(11)(q23), del(17)(p13) and genetic imbalances, but recurrent genetic lesion characteristic for CLL/PL was not found. The follow-up HR-CGH analysis of two cases showed that increase of prolymphocytes in the course of CLL or CLL/PL are associated with clonal evolution and selection of the tumour clone. In conclusion, this study suggests that CLL/PL is a relatively homogeneous disease regarding VH gene mutation, but heterogeneous regarding genetic lesions. The heterogeneity and high number of genomic imbalances found in CLL/PL suggest that a genome-wide instability of the neoplastic cells may play a role in the development of the disease.","['Balogh, Zsofia', 'Reiniger, Lilla', 'Deak, Linda', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Csomor, Judit', 'Szepesi, Agota', 'Gagyi, Eva', 'Kopper, Laszlo', 'Matolcsy, Andras']","['Balogh Z', 'Reiniger L', 'Deak L', 'Bodor C', 'Csomor J', 'Szepesi A', 'Gagyi E', 'Kopper L', 'Matolcsy A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2007 Jun;25(2):90-5. doi: 10.1002/hon.812.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",['10.1002/hon.812 [doi]'],"['Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['1st Department of Pathology and Experimental Cancer Research, Faculty of Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the potential value of a minimal four-color combination panel of 13 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with a CD45/sideward light scatter-gating strategy for a standardized MFC immunophenotyping of the clinically most relevant subgroups of AL. Bone marrow samples from 155 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=79), B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL, n=29), T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL, n=12) and normal bone marrow donors (NBMD, n=35) were analyzed. A knowledge-based learning algorithm was generated by comparing the results of the minimal panel with the actual diagnosis, using discriminative function analysis. Correct classification of the test sample according to lineage, that is, BCP-ALL, T-ALL, AML and differentiation of NBMD was achieved in 97.2% of all cases with only six of the originally applied 13 mAbs of the panel.

To understand how HTLV-1-positive cells including ATLL cells were suppressed by allo-HSCT, we examined HTLV-1 provirus load and residual ATLL cells in peripheral blood of transplant recipients using PCR-based tests. We found that the copy number of HTLV-1 genome, called provirus, became very small in number after allo-HSCT; however, in most cases, provirus did not disappear even among long-term survivors. Tumor-specific PCR tests demonstrated that most of HTLV-1-positive cells that remained long after transplantation were not primary ATLL cells but donor-derived HTLV-1-positive cells. We also found a case having very low amount of residual disease in peripheral blood even long after transplantation. There was only one recipient in whom we failed to show the presence of HTLV-1 genome and antibody against HTLV-1 even with an extensive search, which strongly suggested the elimination of HTLV-1 after allo-HSCT. These results demonstrated that after allo-HSCT the small amount of residual HTLV-1-positive cells were heterogeneous in origin and that long-term disease control for ATLL could be obtained without the complete elimination of HTLV-1.","['Yamasaki, R', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Moriuchi, Y', 'Tsutsumi, C', 'Fukushima, T', 'Yoshida, S', 'Taguchi, J', 'Inoue, Y', 'Matsuo, E', 'Imaizumi, Y', 'Imanishi, D', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Tsushima, H', 'Honda, S', 'Hata, T', 'Tsukasaki, K', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Yamasaki R', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Moriuchi Y', 'Tsutsumi C', 'Fukushima T', 'Yoshida S', 'Taguchi J', 'Inoue Y', 'Matsuo E', 'Imaizumi Y', 'Imanishi D', 'Fujimoto T', 'Tsushima H', 'Honda S', 'Hata T', 'Tsukasaki K', 'Tomonaga M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1212-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404678.

A better understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying induction of immunological tolerance is the key to successful transplantation. Polyclonal antibodies such as antithymocyte globulins (ATG) have been used for decades. The common belief is that ATG efficacy relies on its capacity to deplete T lymphocytes. The aim of this review is to offer an overview of the recent findings that have been demonstrated in ATG's immunomodulatory activity. The polyclonal nature of ATG is reflected in its diverse effects on the immune system: (1) T-cell depletion in blood and peripheral lymphoid tissues through complement-dependent lysis and T-cell activation and apoptosis; (2) modulation of key cell surface molecules that mediate leukocyte/endothelium interactions; (3) induction of apoptosis in B-cell lineages; (4) interference with dendritic cell functional properties; and (5) induction of regulatory T and natural killer T cells. As a consequence, ATG provides multifaceted immunomodulation paving the way for future applications and suggesting that the use of ATG should be included in the immunosuppression therapeutic armamentarium to help reduce the incidence of organ rejection and GVHD.","['Mohty, M']",['Mohty M'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jul;21(7):1387-94. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404683.

There was also a marked reduction in the dissemination of ALL cells to extramedullary sites including liver and kidney in all cases where this occurred. Considering the inhibitory effect of stromal layers on the activity of chemotherapeutic agents and the interactive effect of CXCL12 antagonists with chemotherapeutic agents in vitro, this raises the possibility of using these agents to potentiate the effects of current chemotherapy regimens.","['Juarez, J', 'Dela Pena, A', 'Baraz, R', 'Hewson, J', 'Khoo, M', 'Cisterne, A', 'Fricker, S', 'Fujii, N', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Bendall, L J']","['Juarez J', 'Dela Pena A', 'Baraz R', 'Hewson J', 'Khoo M', 'Cisterne A', 'Fricker S', 'Fujii N', 'Bradstock KF', 'Bendall LJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1249-57. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404684.

Reciprocal chromosomal translocations generate two MLL fusion alleles, where 5'- and 3'-portions of MLL are fused to gene segments of given fusion partners. In case of t(4;11) patients, about 80% of all patients exhibit both reciprocal fusion alleles, MLL.AF4 and AF4.MLL, respectively. By contrast, 20% of all t(4;11) patients seem to encode only the MLL.AF4 fusion allele. Here, we analyzed these 'MLL.AF4(+)/AF4.MLL(-)' patients at the genomic DNA level to unravel their genetic situation. Cryptic translocations and three-way translocations were found in this group of t(4;11) patients. Reciprocal MLL fusions with novel translocation partner genes, for example NF-KB1 and RABGAP1L, were identified and actively transcribed in leukemic cells. In other patients, the reciprocal 3'-MLL gene segment was fused out-of-frame to PBX1, ELF2, DSCAML1 and FXYD6. The latter rearrangements caused haploinsufficiency of genes that are normally expressed in hematopoietic cells. Finally, patients were identified that encode only solitary 3'-MLL gene segments on the reciprocal allele. Based on these data, we propose that all t(4;11) patients exhibit reciprocal MLL alleles, but due to the individual recombination events, provide different pathological disease mechanisms.","['Kowarz, E', 'Burmeister, T', 'Lo Nigro, L', 'Jansen, M W J C', 'Delabesse, E', 'Klingebiel, T', 'Dingermann, Theo', 'Meyer, C', 'Marschalek, R']","['Kowarz E', 'Burmeister T', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Jansen MW', 'Delabesse E', 'Klingebiel T', 'Dingermann T', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1232-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404686.

The supervised learning algorithm k-nearest neighbor was utilized to build gene expression predictors that could classify the ALLs/AMLs according to clinically important subtypes with high accuracy. Validation experiments in an independent data set verified the high prediction accuracies of our classifiers. B-lineage ALLs with uncharacteristic cytogenetic aberrations or with a normal karyotype displayed heterogeneous gene expression profiles, resulting in low prediction accuracies.

Despite potentially curative resection, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients remain at high risk of relapse and death, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 67%. Several randomized trials now confirm a survival benefit with adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy seen in the NSCLC Collaborative Group meta-analysis, including the International Adjuvant Lung Trial, National Cancer Institute of Canada BR.10, and Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association (ANITA) trials, with absolute improvements in 4- and 5-year survival rates of 4% to 15%. This study examines whether referral patterns for adjuvant therapy in NSCLC have changed since the presentation of confirmatory trials. METHODS: Retrospective chart review was undertaken at a major tertiary care center, identifying patients with completely resected stages I-IIIA NSCLC from May 2003 to May 2005. RESULTS: A total of 204 patients were identified (59 IA, 77 IB, 8 IIA, 41 IIB, and 19 IIIA). Institutional policy before May of 2003 was not to administer adjuvant therapy outside a clinical trial. After presentation of the International Adjuvant Lung Trial in May 2003, 31% (36/115) of patients with completely resected NSCLC from May 2003 to May 2004 were referred for adjuvant chemotherapy. After presentation of the BR.10 and Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9633 results in June 2004, 63% (56/89) were referred between June 2004 and May 2005. Reasons for not referring to a medical oncologist included stage IA disease, surgeon thought adjuvant therapy inappropriate, patient declined, comorbidities, postoperative complications, and advanced age. Of 92 patients referred to medical oncology, 42 (46%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Reasons for not prescribing adjuvant chemotherapy included patient refusal (50%), comorbidities (14%), stage IA (10%), and advanced age (4%). Vinorelbine/cisplatin was the regimen most commonly used (67%). CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of positive adjuvant therapy trials in NSCLC has changed clinical practice substantially, doubling the number of patients with completely resected NSCLC referred for adjuvant chemotherapy since May 2004 (31% versus 63%). Although new evidence to support adjuvant chemotherapy in lung cancer is being disseminated to and accepted by physicians, more patient education and decision support may be required to increase uptake of adjuvant therapy in the early stage NSCLC population.","['Kassam, Farrah', 'Shepherd, Frances A', 'Johnston, Michael', 'Visbal, Antonio', 'Feld, Ronald', 'Darling, Gail', 'Keshavjee, Shaf', 'Pierre, Andrew', 'Waddell, Thomas', 'Leighl, Natasha B']","['Kassam F', 'Shepherd FA', 'Johnston M', 'Visbal A', 'Feld R', 'Darling G', 'Keshavjee S', 'Pierre A', 'Waddell T', 'Leighl NB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Thorac Oncol,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,101274235,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/05/22 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Thorac Oncol. 2007 Jan;2(1):39-43. doi: 10.1097/JTO.0b013e31802baff6.,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Pneumonectomy', '*Referral and Consultation']","['10.1097/JTO.0b013e31802baff6 [doi]', 'S1556-0864(15)30016-2 [pii]']",,"['Division of Medical Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital/University Health Network, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: The maximal tolerated dose of 35 mg/m twice-weekly gemcitabine and concurrent standard thoracic radiation was established in a previous phase Ia trial. In this study, a second patient cohort (phase Ib) received twice-weekly gemcitabine concurrent with three-dimensional dose-escalated thoracic radiation (60-74 Gy) after two cycles of induction chemotherapy: gemcitabine (1000 mg/m) day 1 and 8 and carboplatin (area under the curve 5.0-5.5) day 1 every 21 days. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were entered in the phase Ib portion of this trial. Grade III/IV hematologic toxicity was primarily thrombocytopenia (22%) and neutropenia (26%). Grade III/IV esophageal toxicities occurred in 17% of patients, and grade III radiation pneumonitis/dyspnea was observed in 7 of 23 patients. The median and 2-year survival for phase Ib patients were 17.4 months and 32%, respectively. The overall 1- and 2-year survival for all 39 patients (16 phase Ia, 23 phase Ib) was 69% and 32%, respectively.

Due to its unique chemical and bio-activity components, buckwheat has been found to have many uses in food products and medicine. However, very little is known about the toxicity of protease inhibitors from buckwheat. Here, the possible effects of a recombinant buckwheat trypsin inhibitor (rBTI) on the induction of apoptosis of the human K562 cell line were investigated by MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays and flow cytometric analysis. MTT assay showed that rBTI could specifically inhibit the growth of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner, but there were minimal effects on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Furthermore, comparison the effects of rBTI on K562 cells with those of negative control (BSA and the complex of BSA and rBTI) revealed that rBTI was highly toxic to K562 cells, and BSA hardly had any inhibition on proliferation in K562 cells. The analysis of flow cytometric indicated that the apoptosis of K562 cells were 31.0%, 32.8%, 35.3% and 52.1% after treated by rBTI in range of 12.5-100 microg/ml, respectively.

Inhibition of enzymes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis at steps before the formation of 7-dehydrocholesterol has been shown to selectively affect cell cycle progression from G(2) phase in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. In the present work, we explored whether cholesterol starvation by culture in cholesterol-free medium and treatment with different distal cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors induces differentiation of HL-60 cells. Treatment with SKF 104976, an inhibitor of lanosterol 14-alpha demethylase, or with zaragozic acid, which inhibits squalene synthase, caused morphologic changes alongside respiratory burst activity and expression of cluster of differentiation antigen 11c (CD11c) but not cluster of differentiation antigen 14. These effects were comparable to those produced by all-trans retinoic acid, which induces HL-60 cells to differentiate following a granulocyte lineage. In contrast, they differed from those produced by vitamin D(3), which promotes monocyte differentiation. The specificity of the response was confirmed by addition of cholesterol to the culture medium. Treatment with PD 98059, an inhibitor of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, abolished both the activation of NADPH oxidase and the expression of the CD11c marker. In sharp contrast, BM 15766, which inhibits sterol Delta(7)-reductase, failed to induce differentiation or arrest cell proliferation. These results show that changes in the sterol composition may trigger a differentiation response and highlight the potential of cholesterol pathway inhibition as a possible tool for use in cancer therapy.","['Sanchez-Martin, Carolina C', 'Davalos, Alberto', 'Martin-Sanchez, Covadonga', 'de la Pena, Gema', 'Fernandez-Hernando, Carlos', 'Lasuncion, Miguel A']","['Sanchez-Martin CC', 'Davalos A', 'Martin-Sanchez C', 'de la Pena G', 'Fernandez-Hernando C', 'Lasuncion MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Apr 1;67(7):3379-86. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4093.,"['0 (CYP51A1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors)', '136209-43-3 (SK&F 104976)', '1J05Z83K3M (Lanosterol)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.14.14.154 (Sterol 14-Demethylase)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cholesterol/biosynthesis/*deficiency', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lanosterol/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Oxidoreductases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Sterol 14-Demethylase']","['67/7/3379 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4093 [doi]']",,"['Servicio de Bioquimica-Investigacion, Hospital Ramon y Cajal, and CIBER Fisologia Obesidad y Nutricion (CB06/03), Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is well known that the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway is essential for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells under hypoxic conditions. To discover how pancreatic cancer cells adapt to glucose deprivation as well as hypoxia, we sought glucose deprivation-inducible genes by means of a DNA microarray system. We identified 63 genes whose expression was enhanced under glucose-deprived conditions at >2-fold higher levels than under normal glucose conditions. Among these genes, asparagine synthetase (ASNS) was studied in detail. Although it is known to be associated with drug resistance in leukemia and oncogenesis triggered by mutated p53, its function is yet to be determined. In this study, we found that glucose deprivation induced the overexpression of ASNS through an AMP-activated protein kinase-independent and activating transcription factor-4-dependent manner and that ASNS protects pancreatic cancer cells from apoptosis induced by glucose deprivation itself. ASNS overexpression also induced resistance to apoptosis triggered by cisplatin [cis-diammine-dichloroplatinum (CDDP)] and carboplatin, but not by 5-fluorouracil, paclitaxel, etoposide, or gemcitabine. We show that glucose deprivation induces the activation of c-jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) in a mock transfectant but not in an ASNS transfectant. Consequently, an inhibitor of JNK/SAPK decreased the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to apoptosis by glucose deprivation and CDDP. These results strongly suggest that ASNS is induced by glucose deprivation and may play a pivotal role in the survival of pancreatic cancer cells under glucose-deprived conditions.","['Cui, Hongyan', 'Darmanin, Stephanie', 'Natsuisaka, Mitsuteru', 'Kondo, Takeshi', 'Asaka, Masahiro', 'Shindoh, Masanobu', 'Higashino, Fumihiro', 'Hamuro, Junji', 'Okada, Futoshi', 'Kobayashi, Masataka', 'Nakagawa, Koji', 'Koide, Hideyuki', 'Kobayashi, Masanobu']","['Cui H', 'Darmanin S', 'Natsuisaka M', 'Kondo T', 'Asaka M', 'Shindoh M', 'Higashino F', 'Hamuro J', 'Okada F', 'Kobayashi M', 'Nakagawa K', 'Koide H', 'Kobayashi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Apr 1;67(7):3345-55. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2519.,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Asparagine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose/*deficiency', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transfection']","['67/7/3345 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-2519 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathological Oncology, Division of Cancer, Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the interaction of Raf/MEK/ERK and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockades using a selective small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3a, and a pharmacologic MEK-specific inhibitor, PD98059. We found that PD98059, which itself has minimal apoptogenic activity, acts synergistically with Nutlin-3a to induce apoptosis in wild-type p53 AML cell lines OCI-AML-3 and MOLM-13. Interestingly, PD98059 enhanced nuclear proapototic function of p53 in these cells. In accordance with the activation of transcription-dependent apoptosis, PD98059 treatment promoted the translocation of p53 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in OCI-AML-3 cells, in which p53 primarily initiates transcription-independent apoptosis when cells are treated with Nutlin-3a alone. The critical role of p53 localization in cells with increased p53 levels was supported by enhanced apoptosis induction in cells cotreated with Nutlin-3a and the nuclear export inhibitor leptomycin B. PD98059 prevented p53-mediated induction of p21 at the transcriptional level. The repressed expression of antiapototic p21 also seemed to contribute to synergism between PD98059 and Nutlin-3a because (a) the synergistic apoptogenic effect was preserved in G(1) cells, (b) p53-mediated induction of p21 was preferentially seen in G(1) cells, (c) PD98059 strongly antagonized p21 induction by Nutlin-3a, and (d) cells with high p21 levels were resistant to apoptosis.

Ecotropic viral integration site-1 (EVI1) and myelodysplastic syndrome 1 (MDS1) are located at the center of this region, and their DNA copy number increases are associated with at least 5-fold increased RNA transcript levels in 83% and 98% of advanced ovarian cancers, respectively.

EVI1 and MDS1/EVI1 gene products increased cell proliferation, migration, and decreased transforming growth factor-beta-mediated plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter activity in ovarian epithelial cells. Intriguingly, the increases in EVI1 DNA copy number and MDS1/EVI1 transcripts are associated with improved patient outcomes, whereas EVI1 transcript levels are associated with a poor patient survival. Thus, the favorable patient prognosis associated with increased DNA copy number seems to be as a result of high-level expression of the fusion transcript MDS1/EVI1.

The immunogenicity of the epitope was generated by differential protein expression due to alternative splicing, which was completely controlled by 1 intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism located in the consensus 5' splice site adjacent to an exon. Both HMSD-v and HMSD transcripts were selectively expressed at higher levels in mature dendritic cells and primary leukemia cells, especially those of myeloid lineage. Engraftment of mHA(+) myeloid leukemia stem cells in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID)/gammac(null) mice was completely inhibited by in vitro preincubation with the mHA-specific CTL clone, suggesting that this mHA is expressed on leukemic stem cells. The patient from whom the CTL clone was isolated demonstrated a significant increase of the mHA-specific T cells in posttransplantation peripheral blood, whereas mHA-specific T cells were undetectable in pretransplantation peripheral blood and in peripheral blood from his donor.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prefers to integrate within active genes, whereas murine leukemia virus (MLV) prefers to integrate near transcription start sites and CpG islands. On the other hand, integration of avian sarcoma-leukosis virus (ASLV) shows little preference either for genes, transcription start sites, or CpG islands. While host cellular factors play important roles in target site selection, the viral integrase is probably the major viral determinant. It is reasonable to hypothesize that retroviruses with similar integrases have similar preferences for target site selection. Although integration profiles are well defined for members of the lentivirus, spumaretrovirus, alpharetrovirus, and gammaretrovirus genera, no members of the deltaretroviruses, for example, human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), have been evaluated. We have mapped 541 HTLV-1 integration sites in human HeLa cells and show that HTLV-1, like ASLV, does not specifically target transcription units and transcription start sites. Comparing the integration sites of HTLV-1 with those of ASLV, HIV, simian immunodeficiency virus, MLV, and foamy virus, we show that global and local integration site preferences correlate with the sequence/structure of virus-encoded integrases, supporting the idea that integrase is the major determinant of retroviral integration site selection. Our results suggest that the global integration profiles of other retroviruses could be predicted from phylogenetic comparisons of the integrase proteins. Our results show that retroviruses that engender different insertional mutagenesis risks can have similar integration profiles.","['Derse, David', 'Crise, Bruce', 'Li, Yuan', 'Princler, Gerald', 'Lum, Nicole', 'Stewart, Claudia', 'McGrath, Connor F', 'Hughes, Stephen H', 'Munroe, David J', 'Wu, Xiaolin']","['Derse D', 'Crise B', 'Li Y', 'Princler G', 'Lum N', 'Stewart C', 'McGrath CF', 'Hughes SH', 'Munroe DJ', 'Wu X']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC1900082,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/07/12 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(12):6731-41. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02752-06.

Western blot analysis was performed on samples in which there was discrepancy between the results. Information regarding breed, age, gender, housing arrangement and health status were recorded for all pet and cattery-confined cats, while the estimated age and current physical condition were recorded for feral cats. The FIV prevalence in the two feral cat populations was 21% and 25%. The majority of FIV-positive cats were male (60-80%). The FIV prevalence in cattery-confined cats was nil. The prevalence of FIV in the pet cat sample population was 8% (27/340) with almost equal prevalence in 'healthy' (13/170) and 'systemically unwell' (14/170) cats. The age of FIV-positive pet cats ranged from 3 to 19 years; all FIV-positive cats were domestic shorthairs with outside access. The median age of FIV-positive pet cats (11 years) was significantly greater than the median age of FIV-negative pet cats (7.5 years: P<0.05). The prevalence of FIV infection in male pet cats (21/172; 12%) was three times that in female pet cats (6/168; 4%; P<0.05). With over 80% of this pet cat population given outside access and continued FIV infection present in the feral population, this study highlights the need to develop rapid, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic methods that are not subject to false positives created by concurrent vaccination against FIV. This is especially important in re-homing stray cats within animal shelters and monitoring the efficacy of the new vaccine, which has not been challenged against Australian strains. The absence of FIV within cattery-confined cats highlights the value in routine screening and indoor lifestyles. This study provides cogent baseline FIV prevalences in three cat subpopulations which can be used for appraising potential disease associations with FIV in Australia.","['Norris, Jacqueline M', 'Bell, Erin T', 'Hales, Louise', 'Toribio, Jenny-Ann L M L', 'White, Joanna D', 'Wigney, Denise I', 'Baral, Randolph M', 'Malik, Richard']","['Norris JM', 'Bell ET', 'Hales L', 'Toribio JA', 'White JD', 'Wigney DI', 'Baral RM', 'Malik R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,J Feline Med Surg,Journal of feline medicine and surgery,100897329,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/09/07 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Feline Med Surg. 2007 Aug;9(4):300-8. doi: 10.1016/j.jfms.2007.01.007.

The signalling pathways triggered by receptor engagement translate exposure to cytokine into a coordinated biological response. To contain these responses, the initiation, duration and magnitude of the signal is controlled at multiple levels. Suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins act in a negative feedback loop to inhibit signal transduction. Mice with a deletion of SOCS3 die at midgestion due to placental insufficiency. SOCS3-null placentae have increased numbers of mature trophoblast giant cells, disruption of the labyrinthine layer and a decrease in the spongiotrophoblast layer. Genetic crosses have revealed that the phenotype is due to dysregulation of signalling downstream of the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) receptor alpha (LIFRalpha) and that the ligand responsible for this, LIF, is produced by embryonic tissues and acts in a paracrine fashion. These observations highlight the role of LIF as an extrinsic factor regulating trophoblast differentiation in vivo. The creation of mice with conditional deletion of SOCS3 in different tissues has also uncovered critical roles for SOCS3 in the regulation of IL-6, G-CSF and leptin signalling.","['Boyle, Kristy', 'Robb, Lorraine']","['Boyle K', 'Robb L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Ireland,J Reprod Immunol,Journal of reproductive immunology,8001906,PMC2289801,2007/04/06 09:00,2008/03/26 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Reprod Immunol. 2008 Jan;77(1):1-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jri.2007.02.003.

However, the proteins that regulate the structure and activity of SNARE proteins in mast cells are not well understood. Munc18 is one such regulatory protein that plays a crucial role in neurotransmitter release. In this study, we investigated the role of Munc18 and its mechanism for regulating exocytotic release (degranulation) in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3). We obtained RBL-2H3 cells that express a low level of Munc18-2 and found that degranulation was remarkably inhibited in knockdown cells without any change in the expression level of syntaxins or Ca(2+) mobilization. We also observed the behavior of secretory granules in a single cell, and found no significant changes in their number and distribution in Munc18-2 knockdown cells. Using chimera proteins fused with fluorescent proteins, we demonstrated that Munc18-2 interacted with syntaxin-3, but not with syntaxin-4, in vivo. Interestingly, this interaction occurred not only on plasma membrane but also on secretory granules, suggesting that Munc18-2 may regulate granule-granule fusion as well as granule-plasma membrane fusion. These observations suggest that Munc18-2 together with syntaxin-3 regulate degranulation positively during the process of membrane fusion between secretory granules and plasma membrane, rather than during processes that regulate the number or behavior of secretory granules.","['Tadokoro, Satoshi', 'Kurimoto, Toru', 'Nakanishi, Mamoru', 'Hirashima, Naohide']","['Tadokoro S', 'Kurimoto T', 'Nakanishi M', 'Hirashima N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/08/01 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/14 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 2007 Jul;44(13):3427-33. doi: 10.1016/j.molimm.2007.02.013.

These cytokines share the same receptor complex in which the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) subunit is a common constituent. However, at low concentrations and in their monomeric forms, such molecules have a relatively short plasma half-life due to rapid clearance from the kidneys. Here, to prolong their serum half-lives, we have used a multi-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to fuse each of the LIF05 and MH35-BD cDNA fragments to a sequence encoding the Fc portion, and the hinge region, of the human immunoglobulin G (hIgG) heavy chain. The linking was achieved through an oligomer encoding a thrombin-sensitive peptide linker thus generating MH35-BD:Fc and LIF05:Fc, respectively. Both Fc fusion constructs were expressed in insect cell Sf21 and the proteins were purified by two successive affinity chromatography steps using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose and protein A beads. The Ba/F3 cell-based proliferation assay was used to confirm that the proteins were biologically active. In addition, preliminary pharmacokinetics indicates that the Fc fusion constructs have a longer serum half-life compared to their non-fusion counterparts.","['Jazayeri, Jalal A', 'De Weerd, Nicole', 'Raye, Warren', 'Velkov, Tony', 'Santos, Lanie', 'Taylor, David', 'Carroll, Graeme J']","['Jazayeri JA', 'De Weerd N', 'Raye W', 'Velkov T', 'Santos L', 'Taylor D', 'Carroll GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/16 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 2007 May 31;323(1):1-10. doi: 10.1016/j.jim.2007.02.011.

Whether this translates into hypermethylation in UC-associated cancers (UC-Cs) is not known. METHODS: We evaluated the methylation status of 11 genes (MINT1, 2, 31, hMLH1, p16, p14, MGMT, HPP1, SFRP1, ERalpha, and LINE-1) in 48 UC-Cs, 21 UC-associated dysplasias, and 69 sporadic colorectal cancers (S-CRCs) using a quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing analysis. RESULTS: Methylation levels in UC-Cs were lower than S-CRCs for all the genes except MGMT. A methylation index based on the average of Z-scores, for type C (cancer-specific genes: MINT1, MINT2, MINT31, hMLH1, p16, and p14) was -.97 in UC-Cs and .92 in S-CRCs (P = .009). That of type A (age-related genes: HPP1, SFRP1, and ERalpha) was -1.97 in UC-Cs and 1.24 in S-CRCs (P < .001). We observed a significant difference in the incidence of CpG island methylator phenotype between UC-Cs and S-CRCs (8 of 48 [17%] and 26 of 69 [38%]; P = .022). UC-associated dysplasias had significantly higher methylation of type A gene than UC-Cs (Z-score: .07 and -1.97, respectively; P < .001). By contrast, global DNA methylation measured using a LINE-1 assay was significantly higher in UC-Cs than in S-CRCs (58.2% vs 51.0%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation alterations are uncommon in UC cancers. Given that both genetic and epigenetic changes are common in UC mucosa and dysplasias, we speculate that the genetic changes lead to a more aggressive clinical course than epigenetic changes.","['Konishi, Kazuo', 'Shen, Lanlan', 'Wang, Suna', 'Meltzer, Stephen J', 'Harpaz, Noam', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre J']","['Konishi K', 'Shen L', 'Wang S', 'Meltzer SJ', 'Harpaz N', 'Issa JP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Gastroenterology,Gastroenterology,0374630,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/05/18 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2006/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gastroenterology. 2007 Apr;132(4):1254-60. doi: 10.1053/j.gastro.2007.01.035.

While over 50 translocated-partner genes have been identified so far, few studies have detailed the molecular mechanism of partial tandem duplication (PTD) of the MLL gene. The prognostic impact and contribution to leukaemogenesis of MLL-PTD, especially in childhood cases, remain unknown. We have established a novel cell line containing MLL-PTD derived from an 11-year-old patient with AML and designated as KOPM-88. KOPM-88 cells exhibited certain characteristics associated with the myeloid lineage including abundant primary granules in the cytoplasm and the expression of myeloperoxidase. The cell growth of KOPM-88 was cytokine independent but was accelerated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. MLL-PTD of exon 2 to exon 6 and exon 2 to exon 8 was revealed using Southern blotting, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/DNA sequencing. Furthermore, non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice inoculated with KOPM-88 cells exhibited leukaemic infiltrations in the bone marrow and hemiparalysis because of compression myelopathy. This is the first report of an in vivo animal model exhibiting the systemic involvement of childhood AML containing MLL-PTD. KOPM-88 cells and our murine model may be useful for investigating the pathogenesis of childhood AML associated with MLL gene rearrangement.","['Hayashi, Mutsumi', 'Kondoh, Kensuke', 'Nakata, Yuji', 'Kinoshita, Akitoshi', 'Mori, Taijiro', 'Takahashi, Takao', 'Sakamoto, Michi-Ie', 'Yamada, Taketo']","['Hayashi M', 'Kondoh K', 'Nakata Y', 'Kinoshita A', 'Mori T', 'Takahashi T', 'Sakamoto MI', 'Yamada T']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/05/19 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 May;137(3):221-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06553.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Cell Division/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Child', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', '*Gene Duplication', 'Gene Rearrangement/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics']","['BJH6553 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06553.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, and Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. mutsumi@mtb.biglobe.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical staining showed a significant increase of bone marrow microvascular density (MVD) in MDS and de novo AML compared with controls. Surprisingly, in MDS, MVD significantly decreased upon transformation to OL, which was also significantly lower than the MVD of de novo AML. This evidence was strengthened by the pattern of angiogenic mediator gene expression, confirming the importance of various angiogenic mediators including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and the angiopoietin family of mediators (Ang-1 and Ang-2) as well as the receptors for angiogenic mediators, such as VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and the tyrosine kinase receptor, TIE2. By contrast, the anti-angiogenic mediator, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) exhibited significantly higher expression in the bone marrow of MDS --> OL, indicating the importance of this cytokine as the suppressive factor of angiogenesis in MDS.

Ten patients were enrolled, DC were generated from peripheral blood monocytes and vaccination consisted of four subcutaneous injections of increasing numbers of DC (1-50 x 10(6) cells per injection) on days 1, 2, 8 and 21. Vaccination was feasible and safe. Improvement of the cytogenetic/molecular response, as detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), was possibly related to vaccination in four of 10 patients. In three of these patients, T cells recognizing leukaemia-associated antigens became detectable. The proliferative capacity of PBMC in response to autologous DC increased after vaccination in all evaluable patients. We conclude that vaccination with autologous, non-irradiated 'leukaemic' DC is feasible, safe and induces anti-leukaemic T-cell responses in some CML patients. DC vaccination might be useful in CML as postremission therapy, i.e. after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Westermann, Jorg', 'Kopp, Joachim', 'van Lessen, Antje', 'Hecker, Ann-Christine', 'Baskaynak, Gokben', 'le Coutre, Philipp', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dorken, Bernd', 'Pezzutto, Antonio']","['Westermann J', 'Kopp J', 'van Lessen A', 'Hecker AC', 'Baskaynak G', 'le Coutre P', 'Dohner K', 'Dohner H', 'Dorken B', 'Pezzutto A']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/04/06 09:00,2007/06/19 09:00,['2007/04/06 09:00'],"['2007/04/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 May;137(4):297-306. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06547.x.

However, particle-induced mechanisms that control TNFalpha gene expression are not yet well characterized. LITAF [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFalpha factor] is a novel transcription factor that regulates expression of the TNFalpha gene, but nothing is known about its role in wear particle-induced osteolysis. We evaluated the effect of titanium aluminum vanadium (TiAlV) and polyethylene particles on mRNA expression of LITAF. A human monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was used in this in vitro study. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated to macrophage-like cells and exposed to LPS-detoxified polyethylene particles and prosthesis-derived TiAlV particles. Supernatant was used for TNFalpha protein measurement and total RNA was extracted from cells. LITAF was analyzed at the mRNA level using semiquantitative RT-PCR. Both polyethylene and TiAlV particles induced significant upregulation of LITAF mRNA that was followed by a significant TNFalpha response. These effects were dependent on the particle dose. Low particle concentrations exhibited no significant effect on expression of TNFalpha and LITAF mRNA. In comparison to exposure to polyethylene and TiAlV particles, LPS stimulation exhibited similar upregulation of LITAF mRNA, but led to an overwhelming TNFalpha response. Our findings provide evidence that LITAF is implicated in the pathogenesis of wear particle-induced osteolysis.","['Baumann, Bernd', 'Seufert, Jochen', 'Rolf, Olaf', 'Jakob, Franz', 'Goebel, Sascha', 'Eulert, Jochen', 'Rader, Christof P']","['Baumann B', 'Seufert J', 'Rolf O', 'Jakob F', 'Goebel S', 'Eulert J', 'Rader CP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Biomed Tech (Berl),Biomedizinische Technik.

The histologic distribution of cancers in infants and that in older children are also different. We collected infant cases diagnosed as having cancer from the database of the Cancer Registry in our Medical Center between 1995 and 2004. One hundred and twenty infants (66 males and 54 females), including 17 neonates, were diagnosed with cancer over this 10-year period. The top five cancer subtypes were: leukemia in 34 infants (28.3%), retinoblastoma in 19 (15.8%), neuroblastoma in 16 (13.3%), germ cell tumor in 15 (12.5%), and brain tumor in 14 (11.7%).

During the retroviral life cycle, numerous cellular factors interact with the virus and play an essential role in infection. Cultured embryonic stem (ES) cells are susceptible to retroviral infection, therefore providing access to all of the genes required for this process to take place. In order to identify the host factors involved in retroviral infection, we designed and implemented a scheme for identifying ES cells that are resistant to retroviral infection and subsequent cloning of the mutated gene. RESULTS: A library of mutant ES cells was established by genome-wide insertional mutagenesis in Blm-deficient ES cells, and a screen was performed by superinfection of the library at high multiplicity with a recombinant retrovirus carrying a positive and negative selection cassette. Stringent negative selection was then used to exclude the infected ES cells. We successfully recovered five independent clones of ES cells that are resistant to retroviral infection. Analysis of the mutations in these clones revealed four different homozygous and one compound heterozygous mutation in the mCat-1 locus, which confirms that mCat-1 is the ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor in ES cells. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of this recessive genetic approach to identifying critical genes required for retroviral infection in ES cells; the approach provides a unique opportunity to recover other cellular factors required for retroviral infection. The resulting insertionally mutated Blm-deficient ES cell library might also provide access to essential host cell components that are required for infection and replication for other types of virus.","['Wang, Wei', 'Bradley, Allan']","['Wang W', 'Bradley A']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,PMC1895998,2007/04/05 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/04/05 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genome Biol. 2007;8(4):R48. doi: 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r48.,"['0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (TRPV Cation Channels)', '0 (Trpv6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Adenosine Triphosphatases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Bloom syndrome protein)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (RecQ Helicases)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Calcium Channels/*genetics/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Helicases/*genetics', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*virology', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Integrases', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/*growth & development', 'Mice', '*Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'TRPV Cation Channels/*genetics/physiology']","['gb-2007-8-4-r48 [pii]', '10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r48 [doi]']",,"['Department of Cell Biology and Genetics, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, PR China. wxw@sanger.ac.uk']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here I discuss some facts and thoughts that support the idea that p73 could still be a tumor suppressor gene. The tumor suppressor network in which p73 appears to be a participant involves E2F1, JunB, INK4a/p16, ARF/p19, p57kip2 and BRCA1. Knock out of each gene in E2F-1-p73-JunB-p16INK4a network of tumor suppressor proteins result in lymphoma/leukemia formation.

These cells are a common phenomenon for the hematological malignancies and solid tumors. In response to DNA damage, the complex cellular mechanisms including cell cycle arrest, transcription induction and DNA repair are activated. The cells when exposed to cytotoxic agents, the apoptosis lead to cell death. However, the absence of repair machinery makes the cells resistant to tumor sensitizing agents and result in malignant transformation. Mismatch repair gene defects are recently identified in hematopoietic malignancies, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines.

In this investigation, the authors attempted to express the results in terms of the proportion of long-term disease-free survivors and in terms of lifetime in patients who developed recurrent disease or died. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the influence of different covariates on the 2 result criteria in 922 participants in the Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia-94 multicenter trial. RESULTS: The proportion of long-term survivors was 21.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 18.1-25.4%) and was higher in women than in men. The proportion decreased with increasing age, white blood cell count, and lactate dehydrogenase level. The lowest proportion was observed in patients ages 44 years to 55 years (11.4%; 95% CI, 7-17.9%) and in patients with the t(9;22) BCR-ABL karyotype (13.4%; 95% CI, 8.8-19.8%), and the highest proportion was observed in patients with the t(4;11) MLL-AF4 karyotype (31.3%; 95% CI, 18.2-48.3%). The mean expected lifetime of patients who were not cured was 11.4 months (95% CI, 9.1-14.1 months). It was longer in men than in women and was shorter with increasing age, performance status, hemoglobin level, and white blood cell count. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlighted and specified the importance of some classic prognostic factors in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Le, Quoc-Hung', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Ecochard, Rene', 'Iwaz, Jean', 'Lheritier, Veronique', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Fiere, Denis']","['Le QH', 'Thomas X', 'Ecochard R', 'Iwaz J', 'Lheritier V', 'Michallet M', 'Fiere D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/04/05 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 May 15;109(10):2058-67. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22632.,"['0 (MLL-AF4 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Failure']",['10.1002/cncr.22632 [doi]'],['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society'],"[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a patient with chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) infiltrates of the skin of the whole scalp, conventional external-beam radiotherapy with electrons or photons was not able to treat the target sufficiently. Thus, the authors developed a brachytherapy moulage technique using a customized helmet (polyethylene) with flexible interstitial plastic applicators and irradiated the target very homogeneously with a microselectron (192)Ir HDR (high-dose-rate) source (2.0 Gy daily fractionated; 36.0 Gy total dose related to the reference points in 3 mm focus depth). Technical difficulties, CT-supported three-dimensional conformal treatment planning, and verification with TLD probe measurements are described. The treatment was well tolerated and resulted in complete local remission of the CLL infiltrates within a follow-up of 30 months. CONCLUSION: The presented treatment of lymphoma infiltrates at the scalp by HDR moulage techniques is exceptional but safe and practicable to achieve local tumor control.","['Liebmann, Andre', 'Pohlmann, Stefan', 'Heinicke, Frank', 'Hildebrandt, Guido']","['Liebmann A', 'Pohlmann S', 'Heinicke F', 'Hildebrandt G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Here, we describe a protocol for retrovirus-mediated single-cell gene knockout in adult new neurons in vivo.

High-titer retrovirus is prepared by transfecting plasmids into the HEK293T cells and by concentrating the supernatant containing virus. The retrovirus is stereotaxically injected into the dentate gyrus. Cre recombinase is transduced and expressed in a small fraction of adult new neurons in an intact environment, and the gene knockout is highly efficient within the transduced neurons. Virus preparation takes 7 days, but virus injections take less than 1 h per mouse. By changing the survival time of the mice after the injection, one can analyze the effects on new neurons at different ages.","['Tashiro, Ayumu', 'Zhao, Chunmei', 'Gage, Fred H']","['Tashiro A', 'Zhao C', 'Gage FH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nat Protoc,Nature protocols,101284307,,2007/04/05 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Protoc. 2006;1(6):3049-55. doi: 10.1038/nprot.2006.473.,"['EC 2.7.7.- (Cre recombinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Integrases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neurons/*metabolism']","['nprot.2006.473 [pii]', '10.1038/nprot.2006.473 [doi]']",,"['Laboratory of Genetics, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, 10010 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the prevalence of KD mutations in newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive Ph(+) ALL patients and assessed their clinical relevance in the setting of uniform frontline therapy with imatinib in combination with chemotherapy. Patients enrolled in the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (GMALL) trial ADE10 for newly diagnosed elderly Ph(+) ALL were retrospectively examined for the presence of BCR-ABL KD mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (D-HPLC), cDNA sequencing, and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A KD mutation was detected in a minor subpopulation of leukemic cells in 40% of newly diagnosed and imatinib-naive patients. At relapse, the dominant cell clone harbored an identical mutation in 90% of cases, the overall prevalence of mutations at relapse was 80%. P-loop mutations predominated and were not associated with an inferior hematologic or molecular remission rate or shorter remission duration compared with unmutated BCR-ABL.

However, the importance of tissue architecture in the control of nuclear organization remains to be determined. Differentiation of mammary epithelial cells into functional tissue structures, in three-dimensional culture, is characterized by a specific tissue architecture (i.e. a basoapical polarity axis), cell cycle exit and maintenance of cell survival. Here we show that induction of partial differentiation (i.e. basal polarity only, cell cycle exit and cell survival) by epigenetic mechanisms in malignant breast cells is sufficient to restore features of differentiation-specific nuclear organization, including perinucleolar heterochromatin, large splicing factor speckles, and distinct nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) foci. Upon alteration of nuclear organization using an antibody against NuMA, differentiated non-neoplastic cells undergo apoptosis, whereas partially differentiated malignant cells enter the cell cycle. Non-neoplastic cells cultured under conditions that prevent the establishment of apical polarity also enter the cell cycle upon NuMA antibody treatment. These findings demonstrate that the differentiation status rather than the non-neoplastic or neoplastic origin of cells controls nuclear organization and suggest a link between nuclear organization and epigenetic mechanisms dictated by tissue architecture for the control of cell behavior.","['Chandramouly, Gurushankar', 'Abad, Patricia C', 'Knowles, David W', 'Lelievre, Sophie A']","['Chandramouly G', 'Abad PC', 'Knowles DW', 'Lelievre SA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,,2007/04/05 09:00,2007/10/03 09:00,['2007/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2007 May 1;120(Pt 9):1596-606. doi: 10.1242/jcs.03439.

Case report.,912-5,"Granulocytic sarcomas are rare tumors that occur primarily in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia or other myeloproliferative disorders, are seldom seen in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and have never been reported to occur in the cerebellum. The authors describe the case of a patient with APL who harbored a hemorrhagic granulocytic sarcoma in the cerebellum. This 39-year-old woman presented with cerebellar ataxia. Magnetic resonance images revealed an intraaxial tumor in the cerebellum. Bone marrow samples showing infiltration by leukemic blast cells and data from hematological tests led to a diagnosis of APL. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and surgery. She had no response to chemotherapy and died of progressive intratumoral hemorrhage. Results of histopathological studies and immunohistochemical staining of the cerebellar tumor confirmed a granulocytic sarcoma. Flow cytometry showed that the blast cells were positive for leukocyte common antigen, CD13, and CD33 markers. Bone marrow cytogenetics revealed that the patient had a 46,XX karyotype. Although no cytogenetic abnormality was present, fluorescence in situ hybridization detected a chimeric fusion of PML and RARA. This is the first report to document a granulocytic sarcoma in the cerebellum as the primary presentation in a patient with APL and abnormal coagulation. As predicted by the unusual clinical manifestations and radiological findings, the patient's survival was short. Although central nervous system complications in patients with APL are rare, the data in this case highlight the need for individualized treatment when such conditions occur.","['Fukushima, Shintaro', 'Terasaki, Mizuhiko', 'Tajima, Yutaka', 'Shigemori, Minoru']","['Fukushima S', 'Terasaki M', 'Tajima Y', 'Shigemori M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,,2007/04/05 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/04/05 09:00'],"['2007/04/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2006 Dec;105(6):912-5. doi: 10.3171/jns.2006.105.6.912.,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cerebellar Ataxia/etiology', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Cerebellum/pathology', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Chimera/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion/genetics', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies/pathology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications/diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/pathology']",['10.3171/jns.2006.105.6.912 [doi]'],,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Kurume University School of Medicine, Fukuoka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major concern for this growing number of survivors is the risk of late effects of treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether signs of cardiomyopathy were present in patients treated in childhood with cumulative anthracycline doses of less than 300 mg/m(2). PROCEDURE: Evaluation of cardiac function in a cohort of 63 long-term survivors in first continuous remission following treatment of ALL with multi-drug chemotherapy including anthracyclines was performed using standard M-mode echocardiography and tissue doppler imaging (TDI). Associations between age at diagnosis, cumulative dose of anthracycline, sex, length of follow-up, and deviations from normal values in M-mode echocardiograms were evaluated using univariate and multivariate regression analysis. TDI data were compared to normal values using Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. RESULTS: By standard M-mode echocardiography the most significant findings were diastolic dilation of the left ventricle, thinner interventricular septum (IVS), decreased left ventricular mass (LVM) in females, follow-up dependent dilation of the left ventricle in systole and follow-up dependent decrease in ejection fraction (EF). TDI abnormalities included signs of early diastolic dysfunction and myocardial hypertrophy, and were also found in structures that appeared normal by M-mode echocardiography. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the growing evidence that even low to moderate doses of anthracyclines might lead to progressive cardiac dysfunction. It is important that children treated with anthracyclines receive life long follow-up for signs of cardiomyopathy.","['Rathe, Mathias', 'Carlsen, Niels L T', 'Oxhoj, Henrik']","['Rathe M', 'Carlsen NL', 'Oxhoj H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/10/11 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2007 Jun 15;48(7):663-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.20313.,['0 (Anthracyclines)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Echocardiography/methods', 'Echocardiography, Doppler/methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Time', 'Treatment Outcome']",['10.1002/pbc.20313 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Department of paediatrics, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, Bcl-2 expression was shown to be regulated by microRNAs, small endogenous RNA molecules that regulate protein expression through sequence-specific interaction with messenger RNA. By analogy, we reasoned that Mcl-1 expression may also be regulated by microRNAs. We chose human immortalized, but non-malignant, H69 cholangiocyte and malignant KMCH cholangiocarcinoma cell lines for these studies, because Mcl-1 is dysregulated in cells with the malignant phenotype. By in silico analysis, we identified a putative target site in the Mcl-1 mRNA for the mir-29 family, and found that mir-29b was highly expressed in cholangiocytes. Interestingly, mir-29b was downregulated in malignant cells, consistent with Mcl-1 protein upregulation. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 protein expression in KMCH cells. This effect was direct, as mir-29b negatively regulated the expression of an Mcl-1 3' untranslated region (UTR)-based reporter construct. Enforced mir-29b expression reduced Mcl-1 cellular protein levels and sensitized the cancer cells to tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) cytotoxicity. Transfection of non-malignant cells (that express high levels of mir-29) with a locked-nucleic acid antagonist of mir-29b increased Mcl-1 levels and reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Thus mir-29 is an endogenous regulator of Mcl-1 protein expression, and thereby, apoptosis.","['Mott, J L', 'Kobayashi, S', 'Bronk, S F', 'Gores, G J']","['Mott JL', 'Kobayashi S', 'Bronk SF', 'Gores GJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC2432524,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/10/25 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Sep 13;26(42):6133-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210436.

In this respect patients taking cancer chemotherapy are followed for these adverse effects. Echocardiographic myocardial performance index (MPI) was reported as a new method of combined systolic and diastolic function for both adults and children, calculated as isovolumic relaxation time plus isovolumic contraction time divided by ejection time. In addition, it has been postulated that increased inter-lead differences in QT interval (QT dispersion) may be associated with an increased risk of cardiac death. The aim of this study was to determine the probable immediate and late adverse effects of childhood leukaemia treatment containing moderate dose of anthracyclines on heart by MPI and corrected QT dispersion (QTcD). METHODS: MPI and QTcD in 55 children with leukaemia and 38 healthy controls matched for age and sex were evaluated. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference between MPI values of patients and controls (20.7+/-13.1 (1-59.4) and 16.1+/-13.5 (0.3-77.5), P: 0.1, respectively). Also, there was no significant difference in MPI and QTc values between patients taking active treatment and those who completed the therapy and between the patients given a cumulative dose of anthracycline lower and higher than 250 mg/m2. But QTcD values were found to be higher in patients than controls (0.08+/-0.03 and 0.03+/-0.01, P<0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: There was no overt cardiotoxicity in our children with leukaemia treated with protocols of ALL BFM 95 and TRALL 2000 (Modified BFM in Turkey) containing moderate dose of anthracyclines. However, they can cause subclinical cardiotoxicity and further monitoring and evaluation with such sensitive and noninvasive methods over a longer period of time are needed.","['Gulen, H', 'Kazanci, E', 'Mese, T', 'Uzunkaya, D', 'Erbay, A', 'Tavli, V', 'Vergin, C']","['Gulen H', 'Kazanci E', 'Mese T', 'Uzunkaya D', 'Erbay A', 'Tavli V', 'Vergin C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Minerva Pediatr,Minerva pediatrica,0400740,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/09/08 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Minerva Pediatr. 2007 Apr;59(2):107-13.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Daunorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Echocardiography, Doppler', '*Electrocardiography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors']",,,"[""Clinic of Haematology-Oncology, Dr. Behcet Uz Children's Hospital, Izmir, Turkey. huseyingulen@hotmail.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Cancer and Leukemia Group B 39801, we evaluated whether induction chemotherapy before concurrent chemoradiotherapy would result in improved survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between July 1998 and May 2002, 366 patients were randomly assigned to arm A, which involved immediate concurrent chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 2 and paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 given weekly during 66 Gy of chest radiotherapy, or arm B, which involved two cycles of carboplatin AUC 6 and paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 administered every 21 days followed by identical chemoradiotherapy. The accrual goal was 360 patients. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of patients were female, 66% were male, and the median age was 63 years. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities during induction chemotherapy on arm B consisted mainly of neutropenia (18% and 20%, respectively). During concurrent chemoradiotherapy, there was no difference in severity of in-field toxicities of esophagitis (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 30% and 2% for arm A v 28% and 8% for arm B) and dyspnea (grade 3 and 4 were, respectively, 11% and 3% for arm A v 15% and 4% for arm B). Survival differences were not statistically significant (P = .3), with a median survival on arm A of 12 months (95% CI, 10 to 16 months) versus 14 months (95% CI, 11 to 16 months) on arm B and a 2-year survival of 29% (95% CI, 22% to 35%) and 31% (95% CI, 25% to 38%). Age, weight loss before therapy, and performance status were statistically significant predictive factors. CONCLUSION: The addition of induction chemotherapy to concurrent chemoradiotherapy added toxicity and provided no survival benefit over concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone.

To measure effectiveness, viral titers were analyzed in cornea and trigeminal ganglia (TG) during acute ocular HSV-1 infection. Ad:IFN-gamma potently suppressed HSV-1 replication in a dose-dependent fashion, requiring IFN-gamma receptor. Moreover, Ad:IFN-gamma was effective when delivered -72 and -24 h before infection as well as 24 h postinfection. Associated with antiviral opposition, TG from Ad:IFN-gamma-transduced mice harbored fewer T cells. Also related to T cell involvement, Ad:IFN-gamma was effective but attenuated in TG from alphabeta TCR-deficient mice. In corneas, alphabeta TCR(+) T cells were obligatory for protection against viral multiplication. Type I IFN involvement amid antiviral efficacy of Ad:IFN-gamma was further investigated because types I and II IFN pathways have synergistic anti-HSV-1 activity. Ad:IFN-gamma inhibited viral reproduction in corneas and TG from alphabeta IFNR-deficient (CD118(-/-)) mice, although viral titers were 2- to 3-fold higher in cornea and TG compared with wild-type mice. The absence of IFN-stimulated antiviral proteins, 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L, and dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R completely eliminated the antiviral effectiveness of Ad:IFN-gamma. Collectively, the results demonstrate the following: 1) nonexistence of type I IFN receptor does not abolish defense of Ad:IFN-gamma against HSV-1; 2) antiviral pathways oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L and protein kinase R are mandatory; and 3) alphabeta TCR(+) T cells are compulsory for Ad:IFN-gamma effectiveness against HSV-1 in cornea but not in TG.","['Austin, Bobbie Ann', 'Halford, William P', 'Williams, Bryan R G', 'Carr, Daniel J J']","['Austin BA', 'Halford WP', 'Williams BR', 'Carr DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC1865505,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/05/22 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Apr 15;178(8):5166-72. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.8.5166.,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Interferon)', '07MXG07O12 (interferon gamma receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (eIF-2 Kinase)', ""EC 2.7.7.84 (2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase)""]",IM,,"[""2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase/*physiology"", 'Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Cornea/*virology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*drug effects', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interferon/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Trigeminal Ganglion/virology', 'eIF-2 Kinase/*physiology']","['178/8/5166 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.8.5166 [doi]']",,"['Department of Ophthalmology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK 73104, USA.']","['R01 AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI051414-04/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 EY012190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY12190/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI051414/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI053108/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS16539'],,,,,,,,

Heat shock protein (HSP) 90 is a molecular chaperone involved in signal transduction pathways. We hypothesized that HSP90 inhibitors will potentiate ATO effect on constitutive STAT3 activity and cell killing. One concern was that the effect of ATO and HSP90 inhibitors will result in up-regulation of HSP70, a protein known to inhibit apoptosis. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We have used a semimechanistic pharmacodynamic model to characterize concentration-effect relationships of ATO and HSP90 inhibitors on constitutive STAT3 activity, HSP70 expression, and cell death in a cell line model. RESULTS: Pharmacodynamic interaction of ATO and three HSP90 inhibitors showed synergistic interactions in inhibiting constitutive STAT3 activity and inducing cell death, in spite of a concurrent synergistic up-regulation of HSP70.

RESULTS: Supervised statistical analysis identified eight gene expression markers that could predict patient response to tipifarnib. The most robust gene was the lymphoid blast crisis oncogene (AKAP13), which predicted response with an overall accuracy of 63%. This gene provided a negative predictive value of 93% and a positive predictive value of 31% (increased from 18%). AKAP13 was overexpressed in patients who were resistant to tipifarnib. When overexpressed in the HL60 and THP1 cell lines, AKAP13 increased the resistance to tipifarnib by approximately 5- to 7-fold.

Multiple therapies cause down-regulation of Mcl-1 in chronic and acute lymphoid leukemia (CLL and ALL) cells. Mcl-1 has also been reported to mediate resistance to rituximab in CLL. We therefore investigated whether direct reduction of Mcl-1 was sufficient to induce apoptosis and increase sensitivity to rituximab. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used Mcl-1-specific small interfering RNA in ALL cell lines and tumor cells from CLL patients to block transcription of Mcl-1. RESULTS: We show that Mcl-1 down-regulation alone is sufficient to promote mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis in ALL and CLL cells. Given the importance of rituximab in B-cell malignancies, we next assessed the influence of Mcl-1 down-regulation on antibody-mediated killing. Mcl-1 down-regulation by small interfering RNA increased sensitivity to rituximab-mediated killing both by direct apoptosis and complement-dependent cytotoxicity, but did not enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that Mcl-1 is a relevant therapeutic target for ALL and CLL, and its down-regulation has the potential to enhance the therapeutic effect of rituximab in CD20-bearing lymphoid cells.","['Hussain, Syed-Rehan A', 'Cheney, Carolyn M', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lin, Thomas S', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Lucas, David M', 'Byrd, John C']","['Hussain SR', 'Cheney CM', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lin TS', 'Grever MR', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Lucas DM', 'Byrd JC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Apr 1;13(7):2144-50. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2294.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Complement System Proteins', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rituximab', 'Transfection']","['13/7/2144 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2294 [doi]']",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']","['P01 CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA112947-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ketoconazole is used as an inhibitor of adrenal androgen synthesis in men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. This study analyzes the relationship between pretreatment androgen levels and outcome following ketoconazole treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Baseline levels of three adrenal androgens (androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione, and dehydroepiandrostenedione-sulfate) and testosterone were measured. Regression models (logistic and proportional hazard) were used to assess the prognostic significance of these levels in predicting overall survival and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response defined by Consensus Criteria. RESULTS: In 103 patients with available levels, PSA response rate was 28% and median response duration was 4.8 months. The median baseline androstenedione level was 0.64 ng/mL and was 0.88 ng/mL versus 0.53 ng/mL for those with and without a PSA response, respectively (P = 0.034). In univariate analysis, elevation of baseline androstenedione levels was predictive of PSA response [odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.03-4.96; P = 0.043]. In multivariate analysis, both the uppermost and the middle tertile of baseline androstenedione level were associated with an improved overall survival compared with those in the lower tertile (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36-0.98; P = 0.40; hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.32-0.90; P = 0.018, respectively). A linear correlation was observed among all androgen levels. CONCLUSIONS: Higher androstenedione levels predict likelihood of response to ketoconazole and improved survival compared with patients with lower levels. These data suggest that therapy with ketoconazole is less effective in patients with low levels of androgen at baseline.","['Ryan, Charles J', 'Halabi, Susan', 'Ou, San-San', 'Vogelzang, Nicholas J', 'Kantoff, Philip', 'Small, Eric J']","['Ryan CJ', 'Halabi S', 'Ou SS', 'Vogelzang NJ', 'Kantoff P', 'Small EJ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Apr 1;13(7):2030-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2344.,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', '0 (Androgens)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)', 'R9400W927I (Ketoconazole)']",IM,,"['Adrenal Glands/drug effects', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Androgen Antagonists/*therapeutic use', 'Androgens/*blood', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Ketoconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood/drug effects', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*blood/mortality/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']","['13/7/2030 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2344 [doi]']",,"['Urologic Oncology Program, University of California,/San Francisco, California 94143, USA. ryanc@medicine.ucsf.edu']",['CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Etoposide-induced apoptosis plays a role in not only anticancer effect but also adverse reaction, such as myelosuppression. Since we have found that wogonin, a flavone found in Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, prevents thymocyte apoptosis induced by various compounds including etoposide, we examined the effect of this flavone on etoposide-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Although 100 muM wogonin itself significantly increased DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells, this change was not observed in Jurkat cells. On the other hand, this flavone significantly potentiated etoposide-induced apoptosis in Jurkat and HL-60 cells. Similarly, wogonin accelerated etoposide-induced cell death in lung cancer cells.

Therefore, there is a strong need for compounds that are able to modulate or inactivate upregulated signaling events. Natural compounds extracted from plants have long been used and still present a dynamic domain in the research of new therapeutic tools. Among those molecules, curcumin was already described for its antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiseptic properties. Many actions of curcumin target proteins and kinases implicated in the signaling pathways. However, the effects described depend on the treatment conditions used, as well as the cell line studied, and these features vary strongly from one study to the other. During this work, we evaluated the effect of one curcumin treatment (20 muM, 48 h) on the phosphorylation of a number of proteins and kinases in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562.

In our article we found a concentration-dependent cytotoxic activity of curcumin in a panel of eight leukemic cell lines (SKW-3, CEM, U-937, HL-60, HL-60/Dox, K-562, LAMA-84, and AR-230). Additive to synergistic interactions was recorded for combinations with bendamustine and idarubicine in SKW-3 and LAMA-84 cells. Noteworthy, in multiple myeloma cells (RPMI-8226 and U-266) a potentiation of the efficacy of bendamustine by curcumin application was found. Moreover, curcumin increased the bendamustine cytotoxicity in cultures of cells isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The increased bendamustine efficacy could be explained by NF-kappaB inhibition, because this factor is activated in many cancers, especially leukemia and multiple myeloma. Curcumin is characterized by low toxicity and was described to have a chemoprotective activity. Therefore, the level of reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured and a concentration-dependent increase of GSH levels was recorded in AR-230 and SKW-3 cells (concentration range 5-25 muM). Experiments with mice showed significant protection against cisplatin-induced chromosomal aberrations (clastogenic effect) and inhibition of mitoses in bone marrow cells. Curcumin alone caused reduction of the mitotic index. In combination with cisplatin, however, this parameter was increased when compared to cisplatin alone. Our data indicate that curcumin has pleiotropic effects on signal transduction by inhibiting transcription thus exerting antitumor activity. In addition, curcumin has protective and anticlastogenic activity by enhancing the scavenging of free radicals.","['Alaikov, Tzvetan', 'Konstantinov, Spiro M', 'Tzanova, Tzvetomira', 'Dinev, Kyril', 'Topashka-Ancheva, Margarita', 'Berger, Martin R']","['Alaikov T', 'Konstantinov SM', 'Tzanova T', 'Dinev K', 'Topashka-Ancheva M', 'Berger MR']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2007 Jan;1095:355-70. doi: 10.1196/annals.1397.039.,"['0 (Antimutagenic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)']",IM,,"['Antimutagenic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Curcumin/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'U937 Cells']","['1095/1/355 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1397.039 [doi]']",,"['Lab for Experimental Chemotherapy, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University of Sofia, 2 Dunav Str., 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It belongs to the group of alkylphosphocholines (APC) that are inhibitors of protein kinase C and phospholipase C. However, the mechanism of action of erufosine remains rather unclear. We focused on combination effects with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (gleevec, former STI-571 or CGP-57148) against two chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-derived cell lines (K-562 and BV-173). The influence of erufosine on proteins involved in the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate pathway and on expression of the retinoblastoma protein Rb was studied, the latter being a key component for cell cycle entry and progression in mammalian cells. The consecutive treatment of K-562 and BV-173 cells with erufosine (2.5, 5, 15, 30 microM) and imatinib mesylate (0.05, 0.1 microM) led to synergism as measured by the MTT-dye reduction assay and this is reason to hypothesize that such combinations could be beneficial for relapsed patients with drug-resistant disease. Whole cell lysates from K-562 and BV-173 were investigated for the expression of Rb, PKB/Akt, pAkt, and p27 by Western blot. Erufosine caused decreases of pAkt and CML fusion protein p210 (BCR-ABL) protein expression, but induced the Rb protein expression in K-562 cells. A parallel increase in p27 level was observed after 24 and 48 h treatment. These alterations in signal transduction could be an explanation for the drug interaction found. Furthermore, Rb is a substrate of caspases and is cleaved during apoptosis as already evidenced for BV-173 cells. Our experimental findings suggest that erufosine acts through induction of changes in protein signaling and especially through Rb induction. This unique mode of action makes it an attractive partner for combination therapies, for example, in combination with imatinib mesylate for treatment of CML.","['Zaharieva, M M', 'Konstantinov, S M', 'Pilicheva, B', 'Karaivanova, M', 'Berger, M R']","['Zaharieva MM', 'Konstantinov SM', 'Pilicheva B', 'Karaivanova M', 'Berger MR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/05/09 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2007 Jan;1095:182-92. doi: 10.1196/annals.1397.022.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organophosphates)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '0 (erucylphospho-N,N,N-trimethylpropylammonium)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Organophosphates/*pharmacology', 'Quaternary Ammonium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/physiology']","['1095/1/182 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1397.022 [doi]']",,"['Laboratory for Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Chemotherapy, Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical University of Sofia, 2 Dunav Street, 1000 Sofia, Bulgaria. zaharieva26@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we examined whether various types of surfactants including anionic and amphoteric surfactants induce apoptosis or not in mammalian cells. Antimicrobial cationic surfactants induced apoptosis at lower concentration than its critical micelle concentration (CMC) in rat thymocytes. Other quaternary ammonium surfactants, such as cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, similarly increased biochemical and morphological features of apoptosis, whereas both anionic and amphoteric surfactants had no significant effect on these apoptotic features.

METHODS: Recommendations for improving informed consent were elicited from 140 parents of children who had been offered participation in a randomized clinical trial for the treatment of their acute leukemia. Four different methods and data collection time points were used with this group of parents, including open-ended, in-person interviews within 72 hours after the informed consent conference; follow-up telephone interviews 6 months after diagnosis; focus groups during year 3 of the project; and a parent advisory group on informed consent meeting in year 4. RESULTS: The most frequently cited suggestions for improving informed consent during the interviews and focus groups related to giving parents more time to make their decision, the amount and type of information provided, organization of the consent conference, communication style, and providing additional materials. During the parent advisory group on informed consent meeting, parents developed specific guidelines for organization of the information that is presented during the consent process that include 7 major components: timing, sequence, checklist, checking for understanding, anticipatory guidance, segue into randomized clinical trial discussion with historical perspective, and choice. CONCLUSIONS: Through the incorporation of parental perspectives that provide an authentic stakeholder voice, our research represents a true partnership approach to improving the consent process. Parents provided practical advice for improving informed consent that can be applied to most adult and pediatric patient populations.","['Eder, Michelle L', 'Yamokoski, Amy D', 'Wittmann, Peter W', 'Kodish, Eric D']","['Eder ML', 'Yamokoski AD', 'Wittmann PW', 'Kodish ED']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/04/24 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pediatrics. 2007 Apr;119(4):e849-59. doi: 10.1542/peds.2006-2208.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Decision Making', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Parental Consent', 'Patient Selection', 'Pediatrics/standards/trends', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']","['119/4/e849 [pii]', '10.1542/peds.2006-2208 [doi]']",,"['Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon, USA.']",['R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How the BCL-2 family of proteins regulates apoptosis in response to the shutoff of protein synthesis is not known. Here we demonstrate that an Escherichia coli toxin, MazF, inhibited protein synthesis by cleavage of cellular mRNA and induced apoptosis in mammalian cells. MazF-induced apoptosis required proapoptotic BAK and its upstream regulator, the proapoptotic BH3-only protein NBK/BIK, but not BIM, PUMA, or NOXA. Interestingly, in response to MazF induction, NBK/BIK activated BAK by displacing it from anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1 and BCL-X(L) that sequester BAK. Furthermore, NBK/BIK- or BAK-deficient cells were resistant to cell death induced by pharmacologic inhibition of translation and by virus-mediated shutoff of protein synthesis. Thus, the BH3-only protein NBK/BIK is the apical regulator of a BAK-dependent apoptotic pathway in response to shutoff of protein synthesis that functions to displace BAK from sequestration by MCL1 and BCL-X(L). Although NBK/BIK is dispensable for development, it is the BH3-only protein targeted for inactivation by viruses, suggesting that it plays a role in pathogen/toxin response through apoptosis activation.","['Shimazu, Tsutomu', 'Degenhardt, Kurt', 'Nur-E-Kamal, Alam', 'Zhang, Junjie', 'Yoshida, Takeshi', 'Zhang, Yonglong', 'Mathew, Robin', 'White, Eileen', 'Inouye, Masayori']","['Shimazu T', 'Degenhardt K', 'Nur-E-Kamal A', 'Zhang J', 'Yoshida T', 'Zhang Y', 'Mathew R', 'White E', 'Inouye M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,PMC1847711,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2007 Apr 15;21(8):929-41. doi: 10.1101/gad.1522007.

However, as in other malignancies, acquired resistance to cytostatic drugs is a common reason for treatment failure or disease progression. As a model for drug resistance, we developed a CML cell line resistant to cyclophosphamide (CP). Using oligonucleotide arrays, we examined changes in global gene expression. Selected genes were also examined by real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Neither the parent nor the resistant lines had mutations in their ATP binding domain. Filtering genes with a low-base line expression, a total of 239 genes showed significant changes (162 up- and 77 down-regulated) in the resistant clone. Most of the up-regulated genes were associated with metabolism, signal transduction, or encoded enzymes. The gene for aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 was over-expressed more than 2000-fold in the resistant clone. BCR-ABL was expressed in both cell lines to a comparable extent. When exposed to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and nilotinib, both lines were sensitive. In conclusion, we found multiple genetic changes in a CML cell line resistant to CP related to metabolism, signal transduction or apoptosis. Despite these changes, the resistant cells retained sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Bao, Fei', 'Polk, Paula', 'Nordberg, Mary L', 'Veillon, Diana M', 'Sun, Amanda', 'Deininger, Michael', 'Murray, David', 'Andersson, Borje S', 'Munker, Reinhold']","['Bao F', 'Polk P', 'Nordberg ML', 'Veillon DM', 'Sun A', 'Deininger M', 'Murray D', 'Andersson BS', 'Munker R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/04/04 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2006/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Nov;31(11):1511-20. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.03.002.

The putative action of LIF in the regulation of uterine function has been examined using mid-secretory stage monkey endometrial stromal cells cultured on rat-tail collagen type I and treated with recombinant human LIF (rhLIF) or immunoneutralized LIF (in LIF) under serum-free condition. Long-term ovariectomized rhesus monkeys (n=8) underwent simulation of their menstrual cycles with steroid hormones and endometrial tissue samples were collected on cycle day 18; stromal cells were isolated and grown in primary culture on three-dimensional collagen matrix. Significant decline in cellular protein synthesis (P < 0.01) and cell proliferation index (P < 0.05) was observed in cells with increasing doses (0-1000 ng/ml) of rhLIF under serum-free in vitro condition. JAK1 expression in cultured cells increased (P < 0.01) in response to rhLIF as revealed from Western blot and confocal laser scanning microscopic examination, STAT1 and STAT2 expressions were unchanged, while pSTAT3 expression increased (P < 0.01) with increased concentration of rhLIF in culture medium. Autophosphorylation of JAK1 in endometrial stromal cells showed no change with increasing concentration (0.01 to 100 ng/ml) of rhLIF in vitro, but significant (P < 0.05) increase was observed with the time of exposure to rhLIF. Immunoneutralization of LIF or no addition of rhLIF to cultured cells led to significant (P < 0.01) increase in stromal cell proliferation index and significant (P < 0.01) decrease in the level of JAK1 and its autophosphorylation as compared to cells exposed to rhLIF alone. From the present set of experiments we conclude that rhLIF affects the physiological behaviour of monkey mid secretory stage endometrial stromal cells in vitro via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.","['Ghosh, Debabrata', 'Najwa, Abdul Rashid', 'Sengupta, Jayasree']","['Ghosh D', 'Najwa AR', 'Sengupta J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,Indian J Physiol Pharmacol,Indian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0374707,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Physiol Pharmacol. 2006 Oct-Dec;50(4):355-66.,"['0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen Type I/pharmacology', 'Endometrium/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Hormones/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Janus Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Menstrual Cycle/physiology', '*Ovariectomy', 'Phosphorylation', 'STAT Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/*metabolism']",,,"['Department of Physiology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. dghosh@aiims.ac.in']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The WHO classification describes six major groups of chronic myeloproliferative disorders, as follows: chronic myeloid leukemia, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. The diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia and certain types of chronic eosinophilic leukemia are based on the detection of fusion genes (in chronic myeloid leukemia the BCR/ABL fusion gene, and in chronic eosinophilic leukemia the FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha gene). On the other hand molecular markers for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis were lacking, making it difficult to identify these disorders clearly. The authors investigated the incidence of the newly identified somatic point mutation V617F of the Janus-2 tyrosine kinase in patients with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. Janus-2 kinase is a cytoplasmic, non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinase with a key role in signal transduction from multiple hematopoietic growth factor receptors. The mutant protein is constitutively phosphorylated and is able to activate its downstream signaling pathways in the absence of any cytokine, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The authors investigated DNA samples from 132 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders. The V617F mutation was detected by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, and the patients were genotyped by a DNA tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system assay. Approximately 73% of polycythemia vera, 60% of essential thrombocythemia and 67% of myelofibrosis showed the JAK2 V617F mutation. Using the amplification refractory mutation system assay, the frequency of homozygotes was 17.5% in polycythemia vera, 5.4% in essential thrombocythemia and 0% in myelofibrosis. The authors established an effective polymerase chain reaction based method for the identification of JAK2 mutation in the routine oncohematologic diagnostics.","['Rajnai, Hajnalka', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Reiniger, Lilla', 'Timar, Botond', 'Csernus, Balazs', 'Szepesi, Agota', 'Csomor, Judit', 'Matolcsy, Andras']","['Rajnai H', 'Bodor C', 'Reiniger L', 'Timar B', 'Csernus B', 'Szepesi A', 'Csomor J', 'Matolcsy A']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,2007/04/04 09:00,2007/05/16 09:00,['2007/04/04 09:00'],"['2007/04/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/04 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2006 Nov 12;147(45):2175-9.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Phenylalanine', '*Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thrombocytopenia/diagnosis/genetics', 'Valine']",,,,,Uj lehetoseg a kronikus myeloproliferativ betegsegek diagnosztikajaban--a JAK2 mutaci6okimutatasa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory analysis revealed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), a slight elevation of liver enzymes and decreased IgG levels. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a lymphomononuclear pleocytosis and an elevation of protein. A broad diagnostic work-up was negative including a negative Borrelia IgG and IgM ELISA. The patient did not remember recent tick bites, but after specific questioning he recollected a transient erythema on his leg developing just before the start of the last cycle of chemotherapy. As the combination of neuropathic pain and arthralgia, the transient erythema and the lymphomononuclear pleocytosis raised the suspicion of Lyme neuroborreliosis, the patient was treated for 3 weeks with ceftriaxone. On therapy all symptoms resolved and CRP normalized. Retrospective PCR analysis of a CSF sample confirmed the clinical diagnosis by detecting Borrelia garinii DNA. This case demonstrates that in immunosuppressed patients borrelial serology may be negative and that additional diagnostic approaches (including tests for direct Borrelia detection) may be needed to demonstrate borrelial infection.","['Harrer, T', 'Geissdorfer, W', 'Schoerner, C', 'Lang, E', 'Helm, G']","['Harrer T', 'Geissdorfer W', 'Schoerner C', 'Lang E', 'Helm G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2006/05/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infection. 2007 Apr;35(2):110-3. doi: 10.1007/s15010-007-6121-0.,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (DNA, Bacterial)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Borrelia burgdorferi Group/*isolation & purification', 'DNA, Bacterial/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lyme Neuroborreliosis/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['10.1007/s15010-007-6121-0 [doi]'],,"['Dept. of Medicine III, University Hospital Erlangen, Krankenhausstr. 12, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.

We previously found that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25(OH)(2)D(3)) and its potent synthetic analogs downregulate TF and upregulate thrombomodulin expression on monocytic cells, counteracting the effects of TNF at the level of transcription. The human TF gene has characteristic binding sequences for activator protein-1 (AP-1) (c-Jun/c-Fos), nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), Sp-1, and early growth response factor-1 (Egr-1). In this study, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibits TNF-induced TF expression in human monocytic cells. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) reduced basal and TNF-induced TF activities. Gel-shift assay and luciferase assay with the respective reporter vectors showed that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) reduced basal and TNF-induced activities of the nuclear proteins AP-1 and NF-kappaB, but not Egr-1. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) inhibited TNF-induced phosphorylation of c-Jun without affecting phosphorylation of the other pathways. On the other hand, 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) directly inhibited nuclear binding and activities of NF-kappaB in the nucleus without affecting phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB activation pathway. These results indicate that 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) suppresses basal and TNF-induced TF expression in monocytic cells by inhibition of AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation pathways, but not of Egr-1. Our results may help to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) in TF induction, and may have physiological significance in the clinical challenge to use potential 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) analogs in antithrombotic therapy as well as immunomodulation and antineoplastic therapy of leukemia.","['Chung, Jihwa', 'Koyama, Takatoshi', 'Ohsawa, Mai', 'Shibamiya, Aya', 'Hoshi, Asuka', 'Hirosawa, Shinsaku']","['Chung J', 'Koyama T', 'Ohsawa M', 'Shibamiya A', 'Hoshi A', 'Hirosawa S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/07/17 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2007 Jun;87(6):540-7. doi: 10.1038/labinvest.3700550.

METHODS: This work was conducted on 63 ALL children (40 males and 23 females) with age range 4.5 months-16 years (mean = 7.76 years). They included 37 cases attained true remission and 26 complicated by failure of remission, early relapse or death. They were subjected to history, clinical examination and investigations including CBC, BM examination, karyotyping, FISH for translocations and flowcytometry for immunophenotyping and minimal residual disease diagnosis. RESULTS: Cases aged 50.000/mm3 also showed better but non-significant remission rates. Most of the present cases were L2 with better remission compared to other immunophenotypes. Forty informative karyotypes were subdivided into 15 hypodiploid, 10 pseudodiploid, 8 normal diploid and 7 hyperdiploid cases; the best remission rates were noticed among the most frequent ploidy patterns. Chromosomes 9, 11 and 22 were the most frequently involved by structural aberrations followed by chromosomes 5, 12 and 17. Resistance was noted with aberrations not encountered among remission group; deletions involving chromosomes 2p, 3q, 10p and 12q; translocations involving chromosome 5; trisomies of chromosomes 16 and 21; monosomies of 5 and X and inversions of 5 and 11.

Previous studies on mouse femur, however, have demonstrated a spatial gradient for the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, with higher concentrations near the bone surfaces. The objective of the present study was to directly measure the spatial concentration of these cells, as well as marrow vasculature structures, within images of human disease-free bone marrow. METHODS: Core-biopsy samples of normal bone marrow from the iliac crest were obtained from clinical cases at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida Department of Pathology. The specimens were sectioned and immunohistochemically stained for CD34 (red) and CD31 (brown) antigens. These 2 stains were used simultaneously to differentiate between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (CD34(+)/CD31(-)) and vascular endothelium (CD34(+)/CD31(+)). Distances from hematopoietic CD34(+) cells and blood vessels to the nearest bone trabecula surface were measured digitally and then binned in 50-mum increments, with the results then normalized per unit area of marrow tissue. The distances separating hematopoietic CD34(+) cells from vessels were also tallied. RESULTS: Hematopoietic CD34(+) cells were found to exist along a linear spatial gradient with a maximal areal concentration localized within the first 50 mum of the bone surfaces. An exponential spatial concentration gradient was found in the concentration of blood vessel fragments within the images. Distances between hematopoietic CD34(+) cells and blood vessels exhibited a lognormal distribution indicating a shared spatial niche. CONCLUSION: Study results confirm that the spatial gradient of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells previously measured in mouse femur is also present within human cancellous bone. The dosimetric implication of these results may be significant for those scenarios in which the absorbed dose itself is nonuniformly delivered across the marrow tissues, as would be the case for a low-energy beta- or alpha-particle emitter localized on the bone surfaces.","['Watchman, Christopher J', 'Bourke, Vincent A', 'Lyon, Jared R', 'Knowlton, Andrea E', 'Butler, Samantha L', 'Grier, David D', 'Wingard, John R', 'Braylan, Raul C', 'Bolch, Wesley E']","['Watchman CJ', 'Bourke VA', 'Lyon JR', 'Knowlton AE', 'Butler SL', 'Grier DD', 'Wingard JR', 'Braylan RC', 'Bolch WE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Nucl Med,"Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",0217410,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/05/17 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Nucl Med. 2007 Apr;48(4):645-54. doi: 10.2967/jnumed.106.035337.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD34/*biosynthesis', 'Bone and Bones/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells/*cytology']","['48/4/645 [pii]', '10.2967/jnumed.106.035337 [doi]']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona, USA.']",['R01 CA96411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['J Nucl Med. 2007 Apr;48(4):496-7.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety patients completed a battery assessing HRQOL, distress, and neuropsychological functioning before receiving their first HSCT. Delirium was assessed three times per week using the Delirium Rating Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale from 7 days before transplantation through 30 days after transplantation. At 30 days after transplantation, distress and neurocognitive functioning were assessed. At 80 days after transplantation, HRQOL, distress, and neuropsychological functioning were re-evaluated. RESULTS: After adjusting for confounding factors, patients who experienced a delirium episode, versus patients who did not, reported significantly worse depression, anxiety, and fatigue symptoms at 30 days (linear regression beta(s) = 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5, respectively; P < .04). At 80 days, patients with a delirium episode had significantly worse executive functioning (beta = -1.1; P < .02), attention and processing speed (beta(s) = -4.7 and -5.4, respectively; P < .03), mental health on the Medical Outcomes Study Health Survey, 12-item short form (beta = -6.5; P < .02), and anxiety, fatigue, and cancer and treatment distress symptoms (beta(s) = 0.4, 0.6, and 0.3, respectively; P < .03). CONCLUSION: Patients with a malignancy who experience delirium during myeloablative HSCT showed impaired neurocognitive abilities and persistent distress 80 days after transplantation.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The reverse transcriptase multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification technique was used for simultaneous quantification of 31 apoptosis-related transcripts in viable (7AAD-/AnnexinV-) blasts (CD45dim) from bone marrow aspirates of 120 newly diagnosed AML patients. By forward selection, a prognosis-predicting gene expression profile was constructed. The predictive validity of this profile was assessed by cross validation. RESULTS: High transcript levels were associated with poor OS for seven of 31 genes, three of which were proapoptotic. The average expression of all 12 antiapoptotic genes was associated with poor OS (P = .029). A similar association with poor OS was found for the average expression of all 19 proapoptotic genes (P = .009). Forward selection and cross validation revealed the antiapoptotic gene BIRC3 and the proapoptotic genes BAX-(l) and BMF to optimally predict OS. Three equally sized patient groups, constructed by ranking the cross-validated prognoses of the patients, were clearly distinct (median OS times were 8.2, 16.7, and 85.6 months). CONCLUSION: High expression of both pro- and antiapoptotic genes predicted poor OS, which postulates a mechanism of activation of the apoptosis pathway as a whole. This mechanism, which culminates in a three-gene expression signature, allows accurate clinical outcome prediction in AML and puts efforts to target single antiapoptosis genes in a new perspective.","['Hess, Corine J', 'Berkhof, Johannes', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Schouten, Jan P', 'Oudejans, Joost J', 'Waisfisz, Quinten', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J']","['Hess CJ', 'Berkhof J', 'Denkers F', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schouten JP', 'Oudejans JJ', 'Waisfisz Q', 'Schuurhuis GJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 1;25(10):1209-15. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4061.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BMF protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (BIRC3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Baculoviral IAP Repeat-Containing 3 Protein', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics']","['25/10/1209 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4061 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1979 and 1984, 456 children with newly diagnosed ALL and lymphoma were enrolled onto a single protocol at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN). The heights and weights of 422 of the children were measured at diagnosis, during treatment, at the end of therapy, and approximately every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Patients who had attained their adult height at the time of analysis (n = 248) were placed in weight categories based on their BMI, BMI percentile, or weight-for-length percentile depending on age. RESULTS: The overall percentage of survivors who were overweight or obese approximated rates prevalent in the general population of the United States. Young age (< 6 years) and overweight/obesity at diagnosis were the best predictors of obesity at adult height. The rate of BMI increase did not differ significantly between children who received radiation and those who did not, nor between patients who received 18 or 24 Gy of cranial radiation.

DESIGN: Retrospective study conducted in a 500-bed children's hospital in Taiwan. PATIENTS: The course of 101 patients who died between January 2002 and December 2005 was reviewed. The following data were collected: age at death, gender, disease and its status, place of death and survival. There were 59 males and 42 females with a median age of 103 months (range 1-263 months). 50 children had leukaemias, and 51 had malignancies other than leukaemia. The t test and the chi(2) test were applied as appropriate. RESULTS: The study found that 44% of patient deaths occurred in the paediatric oncology ward; 29% of patient deaths occurred in the intensive care unit; and 28% of patients died in their home or at another hospital. Other findings included the following: 46 of 101 (46%) patients died after attempted cardiopulmonary resuscitation and 55 (54%) died with a DNR order in effect. The mean age at death was 9.8 years in both groups with or without DNR orders. CONCLUSIONS: From the study of patient deaths in this tertiary-care children's hospital, it was concluded that an explicit DNR order is now the rule rather than the exception, with more DNR orders being written for patients who have been ill longer, who have solid tumours, who are not in remission and who are in the ward.","['Jaing, Tang-Her', 'Tsay, Pei-Kwei', 'Fang, En-Chen', 'Yang, Shu-Ho', 'Chen, Shih-Hsiang', 'Yang, Chao-Ping', 'Hung, Iou-Jih']","['Jaing TH', 'Tsay PK', 'Fang EC', 'Yang SH', 'Chen SH', 'Yang CP', 'Hung IJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Med Ethics,Journal of medical ethics,7513619,PMC2652771,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/09/12 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Ethics. 2007 Apr;33(4):194-6. doi: 10.1136/jme.2006.016360.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Resuscitation Orders/*ethics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Distribution', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']","['33/4/194 [pii]', '10.1136/jme.2006.016360 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, 5 Fu-Shin Street, Kwei-Shan 333, Taoyuan, Taiwan. jaing001@cgmh.org.tw""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumour types occurring most commonly in this age group are distinctive and differ markedly from those developing in younger children and older adults. OBJECTIVE: The aim is to present survival data for the major types of cancer and for all malignancies combined in adolescents aged from 15 to 19 years, highlighting intercountry differences, temporal trends, and age/treatment regimen comparisons of survival rates. RESULTS: Results from European and American data show that 5-year overall survival among adolescents with cancer is approximately 73-78%, close to that observed among children. As in paediatric series, there are geographical differences, with lower survival rates in Eastern European countries. Adolescents have substantially lower survival than children for acute lymphoid leukaemia, malignant non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Ewing's tumour, osteosarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma. Temporal improvement in survival from children cancer is twice higher than survival from adolescents malignancies. CONCLUSION: Several reasons could explain these geographical differences, such as better referral, greater availability of complex and expensive treatment regimens, reflecting variations in health care systems and resources. Age-group variations could be explained by differences in biology and in treatment regimen, and lack of participation in clinical trials. Some are inherent in the psychosocial characteristics of these patients, such as delays in seeking medical attention, poor compliance with treatment. It is necessary to focus on cancer in adolescence, as the new frontier in oncology, and adolescents with cancer must be now the subject of specific survival analyses.","['Desandes, Emmanuel']",['Desandes E'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,,2007/04/03 09:00,2008/01/04 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/19 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 2007 Nov;33(7):609-15. doi: 10.1016/j.ctrv.2006.12.007.

Treatment of K562 cells with IQDMA resulted in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, presumably involving the concomitant up-regulation of p21 and apoptosis through up-regulation of FasL and sequential activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. In contrast to the lack of appreciable effect on the phosphorylation of ERK and p38 MAPK, activation of JNK was noted when K562 cells were exposed to IQDMA. Moreover, IQDMA-mediated G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis were reversed after treatment with the JNK-specific inhibitors, SP600125 and JNK inhibitor 1. Further investigation showed that SP600125 reduced the activation of FasL, caspase-3, caspase-8, and led to a marked decline of p21.

Here we report a time-dependent biphasic regulation of NF-kappaB in VD(3)-treated HL-60 leukemia cells. After VD(3) treatment there was an early approximately 4 h suppression and a late 8-72 h prolonged reactivation of NF-kappaB. The reactivation of NF-kappaB was concomitant with increased IKK activities, IKK-mediated IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, p65 phosphorylation at residues S276 and S536, p65 nuclear translocation and p65 recruitment to the NF-kappaB/vitamin D responsive element promoters. In parallel with NF-kappaB stimulation, there was an up-regulation of NF-kappaB controlled inflammatory and anti-apoptotic genes such as TNFalpha, IL-1beta and Bcl-xL. VD(3)-triggered reactivation of NF-kappaB was associated with PI3K/Akt phosphorylation. PI3K/Akt antagonists suppressed VD(3)-stimulated IkappaBalpha phosphorylation as well as NF-kappaB-controlled gene expression. The early approximately 4 h VD(3)-mediated NF-kappaB suppression coincided with a prolonged increase of IkappaBalpha protein which require de novo protein synthesis, lasted for as least 72 h and was insensitive to MAPK, IKK or PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Our data suggest a novel biphasic regulation of NF-kappaB in VD(3)-treated leukemia cells and our results may have provided the first molecular explanation for the contradictory observations reported on VD(3)-mediated immune-regulation.","['Tse, Anfernee Kai-Wing', 'Wan, Chi-Keung', 'Shen, Xiao-Ling', 'Zhu, Guo-Yuan', 'Cheung, Hon-Yeung', 'Yang, Mengsu', 'Fong, Wang-Fun']","['Tse AK', 'Wan CK', 'Shen XL', 'Zhu GY', 'Cheung HY', 'Yang M', 'Fong WF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2006/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2007 May 1;313(8):1722-34. doi: 10.1016/j.yexcr.2007.02.022.

In this study, we compared the effect of a class I HDAC inhibitor FK228 with the pan-HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on the Hsp90 chaperone function of K562 cells. We demonstrated that, although having a weaker inhibitory effect on HDAC6, FK228 mediated a similar disruption of Hsp90 chaperone function compared to SAHA. Unlike SAHA, FK228 did not mediate hyperacetylation of Hsp90, instead the acetylation of Hsp70 was increased and Bcr-Abl was increasingly associated with Hsp70 rather than Hsp90, forming an unstable complex that promotes Bcr-Abl degradation. These results indicated that FK228 may disrupt the function of Hsp90 indirectly through acetylation of Hsp70 and inhibition of its function.","['Wang, Ying', 'Wang, Sheng-Yu', 'Zhang, Xu-Hui', 'Zhao, Ming', 'Hou, Chun-Mei', 'Xu, Yuan-Ji', 'Du, Zhi-Yan', 'Yu, Xiao-Dan']","['Wang Y', 'Wang SY', 'Zhang XH', 'Zhao M', 'Hou CM', 'Xu YJ', 'Du ZY', 'Yu XD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2007/04/03 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2007/04/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 May 18;356(4):998-1003. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.076.

HL-60 cells express the highest levels of Bcl-2 among the cell lines examined. Treated with 5 microM of MNB only for 6 h, 85% of HL-60 cells were detected to undergo apoptosis. Pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, blocks MNB-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Caspase-2, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-8, caspase-9, and PARP activation were observed at as early as 4 to 6 h of MNB treatment. In addition, it has been confirmed that the caspase-3 specific inhibitor, Z-DEVD-FMK, blocks the activation of caspase-8 in MNB-treated HL-60 cells. MNB treatment does not change Bcl-2 or Bax expression level in HL-60 cells, but causes Bid cleavage. Further experiments have illustrated that MNB inhibits the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with Bax or Bid, reduces the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsimt), and induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria in HL-60 cells. These results suggest that MNB induces apoptosis in HL-60 by inhibiting the heterodimerization of Bcl-2 with pro-apoptosis Bcl-2 members, resulting in a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome c release, activation of caspases and PARP; it is a caspase-dependent process in which the activation of caspase-8 is dependent on the mitochondrial apoptosis signal transduction pathway. MNB prolongs the life spans of HL-60 bearing mice, potently kills fresh AML and ALL cells, indicating that it has the potential to be developed to treat leukemia.","['Zhang, Manchao', 'Ling, Yan', 'Yang, Chao-Yie', 'Liu, Hongpeng', 'Wang, Renxiao', 'Wu, Xihan', 'Ding, Ke', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Griffith, Brian N', 'Mohammad, Ramzi M', 'Wang, Shaomeng', 'Yang, Dajun']","['Zhang M', 'Ling Y', 'Yang CY', 'Liu H', 'Wang R', 'Wu X', 'Ding K', 'Zhu F', 'Griffith BN', 'Mohammad RM', 'Wang S', 'Yang D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/09/22 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2007 Jul;86(7):471-81. doi: 10.1007/s00277-007-0288-4.

The patients in our case series with leukemic phase ALCL exhibited rare clinical features. The patients presented with massive extranodal disease involving cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), liver, spleen, lungs, and bone marrow. CSF involvement was documented morphologically as well as by flow cytometry in two patients. Two of the patients had small cell variant and the third patient had common type ALCL. The neoplastic cells in all three patients were ALK positive; however these patients died within months of diagnosis. Leukemic phase ALCL is rare, and behaves in an aggressive manner. Some, but not all, cases in the literature presenting with peripheral blood involvement had small cell variant ALCL, as seen in two of our cases.

Experiences with bortezomib in plasma cell leukemia prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have not yet been reported. CASE REPORT: A 66- year-old male patient was admitted for IgA myeloma(IIIA) with del q13. The myeloma progressed to plasma cell leukemia. Bortezomib was given, free light chain (FLC) excretion decreased, and myeloma cells disappeared from blood and decreased in marrow. An unrelated, mismatched allogeneic SCT was performed. The patient was discharged after engraftment with full chimerism without signs of GvHD. FLC excretion increased, and immunosuppression was discontinued. From day +84 on, bortezomib was infused again and FLC excretion decreased rapidly. Relapse was confirmed in marrow, and bortezomib was continued. Donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) had no effect, and a further cycle of bortezomib and thalidomide had only minor effects. On day +209, the patient died from myeloma. CONCLUSION: This case gives evidence for an excellent initial response of plasma cell leukemia to bortezomib, however, early relapse after SCT clearly indicates limitations of both bortezomib therapy and allogeneic SCT in high-risk myeloma. Future developments are mandatory and could include combination of bortezomib with other cytostatics and early DLI in the absence of GvHD. In addition, there is need to clarify if graft-versus-myeloma effect is diminished by bortezomib therapy after allogeneic SCT.","['Kruger, William H', 'Kiefer, Thomas', 'Schuler, Frank', 'Lotze, Christian', 'Busemann, Christoph', 'Dolken, Gottfried']","['Kruger WH', 'Kiefer T', 'Schuler F', 'Lotze C', 'Busemann C', 'Dolken G']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2007 Apr;30(4):193-5. doi: 10.1159/000100056.

We wanted to study incidence trends and familial risks for pituitary adenomas and associated tumors through parental and sibling probands, using the nation-wide Swedish Family-Cancer Database on 10.5 million individuals, containing families with parents and offspring. Cancer data were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from years 1958 to 2002, including 3239 pituitary tumor patients. Familial risk for offspring was defined through standardized incidence ratio (SIR), adjusted for many variables. The incidence of pituitary adenoma has increased moderately from 1958 to the 1990s and declined thereafter. There were only three offspring-parent pairs with a concordant pituitary tumor, the SIR was not significant. Parental skin cancer (SIR 1.60) and leukemia (1.90, chronic lymphatic leukemia 2.59) were associated with offspring pituitary adenoma diagnosed at any age up to 70 years. There was a strong association of pituitary adenomas with nervous system hemangiopericytomas, SIR 182. The only significant association among siblings was between pituitary tumors and breast cancer (1.46). The risk of pituitary adenoma was marginally increased in individuals whose siblings were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. The results suggest an association of pituitary adenomas with nervous system hemangiopericytomas and breast and colorectal cancers, in addition to some other tumor types. Whether these associations can be explained by the recently identified pituitary adenoma predisposing gene, AIP, remains to be established.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Ji, Jianguang']","['Hemminki K', 'Forsti A', 'Ji J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Endocr Relat Cancer,Endocrine-related cancer,9436481,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Endocr Relat Cancer. 2007 Mar;14(1):103-9. doi: 10.1677/ERC-06-0008.,,IM,,"['Adenoma/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemangiopericytoma/epidemiology/genetics', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/epidemiology/genetics', 'Pituitary Neoplasms/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Registries', 'Sweden/epidemiology']","['14/1/103 [pii]', '10.1677/ERC-06-0008 [doi]']",,"['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A particularly challenging example is found in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) where all available kinase inhibitors in clinic are ineffective against the BCR-ABL mutant, T315I. As an alternative approach to kinase inhibition, an orally administered heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, IPI-504, was evaluated in a murine model of CML. Treatment with IPI-504 resulted in BCR-ABL protein degradation, decreased numbers of leukemia stem cells, and prolonged survival of leukemic mice bearing the T315I mutation. Hsp90 inhibition more potently suppressed T315I-expressing leukemia clones relative to the wild-type (WT) clones in mice. Combination treatment with IPI-504 and imatinib was more effective than either treatment alone in prolonging survival of mice simultaneously bearing both WT and T315I leukemic cells. These results provide a rationale for use of an Hsp90 inhibitor as a first-line treatment in CML by inhibiting leukemia stem cells and preventing the emergence of imatinib-resistant clones in patients. Rather than inhibiting kinase activity, elimination of mutant kinases provides a new therapeutic strategy for treating BCR-ABL-induced leukemia as well as other cancers resistant to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.","['Peng, Cong', 'Brain, Julia', 'Hu, Yiguo', 'Goodrich, Ami', 'Kong, Linghong', 'Grayzel, David', 'Pak, Roger', 'Read, Margaret', 'Li, Shaoguang']","['Peng C', 'Brain J', 'Hu Y', 'Goodrich A', 'Kong L', 'Grayzel D', 'Pak R', 'Read M', 'Li S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1924476,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):678-85. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-054098.

Here, we report that culture supernatants (TSNs) from several types of tumor cell lines can drive monocytes to become immunosuppressive Mvarphi. Kinetic experiments revealed that soon after exposure to these TSNs, monocytes began to provoke transient proinflammatory responses and then became refractory to subsequent stimulation. Other TSNs that failed to cause such temporary preactivation did not alter Mvarphi polarization. Consistent with these results, we observed that the monocytes/Mvarphi in different areas of human tumor samples exhibited distinct activation patterns. Moreover, we found that hyaluronan fragments constitute a common factor produced by various tumors to induce the formation of immunosuppressive Mvarphi, and also that upregulation of hyaluronan synthase-2 in tumor cells is correlated with the ability of the cells to cause Mvarphi dysfunction. These results indicate that soluble factors derived from tumor cells, including hyaluronan fragments, co-opt the normal development of Mvarphi to dynamically educate the recruited blood monocytes in different niches of a tumor. The malignant cells can thereby avoid initiation of potentially dangerous Mvarphi functions and create favorable conditions for tumor progression.","['Kuang, Dong-Ming', 'Wu, Yan', 'Chen, Nini', 'Cheng, Jiasen', 'Zhuang, Shi-Mei', 'Zheng, Limin']","['Kuang DM', 'Wu Y', 'Chen N', 'Cheng J', 'Zhuang SM', 'Zheng L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):587-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-068031.

One of the best candidate genes involved in conferring self-renewal capacity is Bmi-1, which has been proven to be essential for the maintenance of both normal adult hematopoietic and leukemia stem cells, as well as adult neural stem cells. To investigate the possible role of Bmi-1 in other cell types that also self-renew, we generated Bmi-1-green fluorescent protein (GFP)-knock-in mice, in which GFP was expressed under the endogenous transcriptional regulatory elements of the Bmi-1 gene. Using these targeted reporter mice, we demonstrated that Bmi-1 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) at its highest levels and downregulated upon commitment to differentiation. An in vivo reconstitution assay revealed that the frequency of HSCs was 1/16 in Bmi-1high c-kit+ lin -Sca-1+ bone marrow (BM) cells and 1/49 in Bmi-1 high lin- BM cells, suggesting that Bmi-1 may serve as a marker for normal HSCs. In murine leukemia models induced by P210BCR/ABL or TEL/PDGFbetaR + AML1/ETO, Bmi-1 was not overexpressed in leukemic HSCs, despite the increase in the HSC numbers. Bmi-1 was expressed at its highest levels in undifferentiated leukemia cells. Furthermore, in several other nonhematopoietic tissues, cells could be separated into distinct subpopulations with differential Bmi-1 expression. Thus, these mice allow for the isolation of viable Bmi-1-expressing cells and have the potential to become a useful tool for understanding the role of Bmi-1 in normal and cancer stem cells in multiple tissue types.

Primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells transduced with retroviral vectors encoding TAg-induced histiocytic sarcoma (HS) or myeloid leukemia (ML) in transplanted mice (average survival of 21 weeks). Retrovirally introducing TAg into pretransformed 32D cells generated a monocytic leukemia, with faster kinetics ( approximately 8 weeks).

The drug is extensively metabolized, and recently it was shown that its metabolites have differing efficacies against malignant cells. Therefore, we established a new isocratic HPLC method, which sensitively detects PKC412 and five of its metabolites. METHOD: Quantification was performed using N-phenyl-1-naphtylamine as an internal standard. We could demonstrate linearity in a range from 10 to 10,000 ng/ml PKC412 with an intra-day variability of less than 7.5% and an inter-day-variability of less than 11%. RESULTS: The assay was used to monitor plasma samples from patients with AML treated within a clinical trial. Here we could demonstrate the ability of the assay to detect five metabolites of PKC412 and describe the application of the assay for drug monitoring in clinical situations. CONCLUSION: The assay described here will enable a discriminative analysis of PKC412 and its metabolites in human plasma samples. First clinical application of the assay suggests different rates of metabolism of the individual metabolites of PKC412 with e.g. accumulation of CGP52421 epimer 2 even after cessation of therapy. Since it is assumed that different metabolites of PKC412 have a very individual mode of actions, determination of PKC412 and its metabolites within clinical studies of the drug will be important.","['Illmer, Thomas', 'Thiede, Hans-M', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Bornhauser, Martin', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Schleyer, Eberhard', 'Ehninger, Gerhard']","['Illmer T', 'Thiede HM', 'Thiede C', 'Bornhauser M', 'Schaich M', 'Schleyer E', 'Ehninger G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods,Journal of pharmacological and toxicological methods,9206091,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Toxicol Methods. 2007 Jul-Aug;56(1):23-7. doi: 10.1016/j.vascn.2006.11.005.

The HTLV-1 transcriptional transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in virus replication and disease progression. Traditionally, Tax is described as a nuclear protein where it performs its primary role as a transcriptional transactivator. However, recent studies have clearly shown that Tax can also be localized to the cytoplasm where it has been shown to interact with a number of host transcription factors most notably NF-kappaB, constitutive expression of which is directly related to the T cell transforming properties of Tax in ATL patients. The presence of a functional nuclear export signal (NES) within Tax and the secretion of full-length Tax have also been demonstrated previously. Additionally, release of Tax from HTLV-1-infected cells and the presence of cell-free Tax was demonstrated in the CSF of HAM/TSP patients suggesting that the progression to HAM/TSP might be mediated by the ability of Tax to function as an extracellular cytokine. Therefore, in both ATL and HAM/TSP Tax nuclear export and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling may play a critical role, the mechanism of which remains unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated that the calcium binding protein calreticulin interacts with Tax by co-immunoprecipitation. This interaction was found to localize to a region at or near the nuclear membrane. In addition, differential expression of calreticulin was demonstrated in various cell types that correlated with their ability to retain cytoplasmic Tax, particularly in astrocytes. Finally, a comparison of a number of HTLV-1-infected T cell lines to non-infected T cells revealed higher expression of calreticulin in infected cells implicating a direct role for this protein in HTLV-1 infection.","['Alefantis, Timothy', 'Flaig, Katherine E', 'Wigdahl, Brian', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Alefantis T', 'Flaig KE', 'Wigdahl B', 'Jain P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,PMC2043122,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2007 May;61(4):194-200. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.02.005.

FLRG (alternative names: follistatin-related protein, FSRP/follistatin-like-3, FSTL3) is a secreted glycoprotein highly similar to follistatin. Like follistatin, FLRG is involved in the regulation of various biological effects through its binding to members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) superfamily such as activin A and myostatin. We have previously shown that TGFbeta and activin A are potent inducers of FLRG transcriptional activation through the Smad proteins. Using a biochemical approach, we investigated whether tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) could regulate FLRG expression since TNFalpha plays a critical role in hematopoietic malignancies. We demonstrate that TNFalpha activates FLRG expression at the transcriptional level. This activation depends on a promoter region containing four 107-108 bp DNA repeats, which are evolutionary conserved in primates. These repeats carry a strong phylogenetic signal, which is not common among non-coding sequences. Each DNA repeat contains one TNFalpha responsive element (5'-GGGAGAG/TTCC-3') able to bind nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcription factors. We also show that TGFbeta, through the Smad proteins, potentates the effect of TNFalpha on FLRG expression. This cooperation is unexpected since TGFbeta and TNFalpha usually have opposite biological effects. In all, this work brings new insights in the understanding of FLRG regulation by cytokines and growth factors. It opens attractive perspectives of research that should allow us to better understand the role of FLRG during tumorigenesis.","['Bartholin, Laurent', 'Guindon, Stephane', 'Martel, Sylvie', 'Corbo, Laura', 'Rimokh, Ruth']","['Bartholin L', 'Guindon S', 'Martel S', 'Corbo L', 'Rimokh R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2006/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 2007 May 15;393(1-2):153-62. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2007.02.007.

Though no apparent elevation of ERK activity was observed during the apoptosis in NB4 cells caused by 20 microM sodium selenite treatment, PD98059 and U0126, specific chemical inhibitors of the MEK/ERK signaling pathway, were shown to strongly prevent the apoptosis process, while ERK activator TPA enhanced the process. It is also known that p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 and JNK inhibitor SP600125 had slight effects on apoptosis. Further study indicated that ERK exerted its proapoptotic effect only at the early stage of apoptosis and played an antiapoptotic role at the later stages.

METHODS AND RESULTS: A descriptive analysis of the histology of the BM in T-cell LGL leukaemia was performed (n = 38). Antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD16, CD56, CD57 and CD20 or CD79a were employed. Antibodies against CD68 (macrophages) and CD34 (sinusoids) were also included. BM was normocellular or hypercellular in the majority of cases, with interstitial lymphoid infiltration in 97%. Lymphoid nodules were present in 55% and intrasinusoidal permeation in 58%. Apoptotic figures and haemosiderin deposition were common. All cases showed trilinear haematopoiesis with normal or increased megakaryopoiesis and erythropoiesis, but normal/reduced myelopoiesis. Reticulin was increased (Grade II-III). Immunohistochemistry revealed interstitial infiltration in all cases and helped to identify lymphoid nodules in two-thirds of cases. Preferential localization of CD8+ T lymphocytes to the interstitium and CD4+ T lymphocytes to the periphery of CD20+ B-cell nodules was seen in almost 90% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Nodules with non-clonal B-cell centres surrounded by CD4+ cells, with interstitial CD8+ cells, are a characteristic finding in T-cell LGL leukaemia and may represent a histological signature for this condition.","['Osuji, N', 'Beiske, K', 'Randen, U', 'Matutes, E', 'Tjonnfjord, G', 'Catovsky, D', 'Wotherspoon, A']","['Osuji N', 'Beiske K', 'Randen U', 'Matutes E', 'Tjonnfjord G', 'Catovsky D', 'Wotherspoon A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/05/18 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2007 Apr;50(5):547-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02656.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9011-92-1 (Hemosiderin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis/physiology', 'Hemosiderin/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology']","['HIS2656 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2559.2007.02656.x [doi]']",,"['Section of Haemato-oncology, Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK. nnenna.osuji@icr.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EMS is associated with a high risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the mechanisms underlying the disease progression are unknown. In the present study, we have investigated a case of EMS harboring a t(8;22)(p11;q11)/BCR-FGFR1 rearrangement as well as a t(9;21)(q34;q22) at the time of AML transformation. FISH and RT-PCR analyses revealed that the t(9;21) leads to a fusion gene consisting of the 5' part of RUNX1 (exons 1-4) fused to repetitive sequences of a gene with unknown function on chromosome 9, adding 70 amino acids to RUNX1 exon 4. The t(9;21) hence results in a truncation of RUNX1. No point mutations were found in the other RUNX1 allele. The most likely functional outcome of the rearrangement was haploinsufficiency of RUNX1, which thus may be one mechanism by which EMS transforms to AML.","['Agerstam, Helena', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Lassen, Carin', 'Swedin, Agneta', 'Richter, Johan', 'Vandenberghe, Peter', 'Johansson, Bertil', 'Fioretos, Thoas']","['Agerstam H', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Lassen C', 'Swedin A', 'Richter J', 'Vandenberghe P', 'Johansson B', 'Fioretos T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,2007/03/31 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/03/31 09:00'],"['2007/03/31 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2007 Jul;46(7):635-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.20442.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",['10.1002/gcc.20442 [doi]'],,"['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. helena.agerstam@med.lu.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicated that after injecting MEL cells, the mice entered into a pathological status similar to erythroleukemia, which had the following exhibitions: the tissue structures of the liver and spleen were damaged, a mass of proerythroblasts, basophil erythroblasts and polychromatophilic erythroblasts could be observed on the smears of the bone marrow and spleen, and the deformability and orientation ability of erythrocytes were both depressed. The pathogenicity of MEL-TF19 cells carrying TFAR19 gene was obviously lower than that of MEL cells, and the MEL-TF19 cells even lost their faintish pathogenicity under the apoptosis-inducing effect of the chemotherapeutic reagent.

Recent evidence has revealed that TM has unique effects on cellular proliferation, adhesion, and inflammation. We examined TM expression in the arterial remodeling process with different shear conditions. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (Q-PCR) revealed that shear stress (25 dyne/cm(2) for 6 hours) induced a 2.6 +/- 0.4-fold increase in TM mRNA levels in endothelial cell culture. Adult FVB (Friend leukemia virus B strain) mice underwent transverse aortic constriction (TAC) between the right (RCA) and left carotid artery (LCA). Doppler (n = 8), morphometric (n = 8), and Q-PCR (n = 8 or 10) studies were performed on carotid arteries at different time points. The RCA lumen and media area increased. The LCA wall shear stress decreased after TAC. RCA wall shear stress increased at day 7 followed by a decrease to the baseline at day 28. TM mRNA level in the LCA was decreased by 61% at day 7 after TAC (0.39 +/- 0.04; p < 0.05 vs. baseline). It progressively returned to the baseline at day 14 (0.85 +/- 0.12) and day 28 (1.48 +/- 0.05; all p = NS).

Evidence is emerging that leukemic oncogenes and hematopoietic cytokines interact with mRNA decay pathways. These pathways can co-regulate functionally related genes through specific motifs in the 3'-untranslated region of targeted transcripts. The steps that link external stimuli to transcript turnover are not fully understood, but include subcellular relocalization or post-transcriptional modification of specific transcript-stabilizing or -destabilizing proteins. Improper functioning of these regulators of mRNA turnover can impede normal cellular differentiation or promote cancers. By delineating how subsets of transcripts decay in synchrony during normal hematopoiesis, it may be possible to determine whether this post-transcriptional regulatory pathway is hijacked in leukemogenesis.","['Steinman, R A']",['Steinman RA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1158-71. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404656.

To model this process, lymphoblastic leukemia cells from BCR/ABL transgenic mice were treated with the farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) SCH66336 while in coculture with primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Coculture with fibroblasts allowed the outgrowth of a subpopulation of drug-resistant lymphoblasts that expressed N-cadherin, a cell-cell adhesion protein that normally is only expressed on specific cell types, including hematopoietic stem cells and fibroblasts. N-cadherin expression promoted increased adhesion of the lymphoblasts to the fibroblasts. Importantly, de novo expression of N-cadherin in parental nonexpressing lymphoblasts using lentiviral transduction increased the ability of the cells to survive FTI treatment. We conclude that FTI drug treatment of Bcr/Abl-positive lymphoblastic leukemia cells that are in contact with a defined microenvironment induces the selective survival of a more primitive subpopulation of leukemia cells that expresses N-cadherin. Experimental drug treatment of cancer cells in model systems that include a microenvironment may reveal novel molecules that contribute to drug resistance and may aid in the design of specific therapies to eradicate more primitive cells.","['Zhang, B', 'Groffen, J', 'Heisterkamp, N']","['Zhang B', 'Groffen J', 'Heisterkamp N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1189-97. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404667.

PLL accounts for approximately 2% of chronic lymphoid leukemias. The clinical course is progressive in the majority of cases due to the resistance of the disease to conventional chemotherapy. The disease is divided according to the cell of origin into the B- (B-PLL) and T-cell (T-PLL) types. T-PLL and B-PLL are morphologically identical, but lymphadenopathy and skin involvement are more common in T-PLL than in B-PLL. Approximately 80% of cases are of B-cell phenotype. T-PLL has a more aggressive course, poorer response to chemotherapy, and shorter median survival than B-PLL. PLL has poorer prognosis than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and the patients with static disease for a longer period of time are rare. In general, B-PLL patients have better prognosis than T-PLL patients. PLL is still considered an incurable disease. Similarly to CLL, treatment is not indicated in asymptomatic patients. In previous decades, splenectomy, splenic irradiation, leucapheresis, and alkylating agents used alone or in combination with other cytotoxic agents have been used for the treatment of PLL. Subsequently, purine nucleoside analogs (fludarabine, cladribine, and pentostatin) have been introduced for the therapy of these disorders. More recently, monoclonal antibodies, especially alemtuzumab, have been found more effective, especially in T-PLL. Finally, high-dose chemotherapy followed by allogenic or autologous stem cell transplantation seems to be an effective, probably curative, strategy for the treatment of selected patients with PLL. In this review, current therapeutic strategies in PLL are presented.","['Robak, Tadeusz', 'Robak, Pawel']","['Robak T', 'Robak P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,2007/03/30 09:00,2008/03/07 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/03/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Sci Monit. 2007 Apr;13(4):RA69-80.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use', 'Purine Nucleosides/chemistry/*therapeutic use', 'Rituximab', 'Splenectomy/methods', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",['9565 [pii]'],,"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",,,,118,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether sirolimus has a similar effect on CMV reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is not known. We evaluated 606 patients who underwent HSCT between April 2000 and June 2004 to identify risk factors for CMV reactivation 100 days after transplantation. The cohort included 252 patients who received sirolimus-tacrolimus for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis; the rest received non-sirolimus-based regimens. An initial positive CMV DNA hybrid capture assay was observed in 225 patients (37.1%) at a median 39 days after HSCT for an incidence rate of 0.50 cases/100 patient-days (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.57). Multivariable Cox modeling adjusting for CMV donor-recipient serostatus pairs, incident acute GVHD, as well as other important covariates, confirmed a significant reduction in CMV reactivation associated with sirolimus-tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis, with an adjusted HR of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.27-0.78; P = .004). The adjusted HR was 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.55; P = .001) when persistent CMV viremia was modeled.

Silencing of viral information including Tax, the major contributor to the oncogenic potential of the virus, is critical if not mandatory for tumor progression. In this study, we have identified epigenetic mechanisms that govern the complete suppression of viral expression, using a lymphoma-derived B-cell clone carrying a silent provirus. Silencing was not relieved by injection of the malignant B cells into sheep. However, exogenous expression of Tax or treatment with either the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5'azacytidine or the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor trichostatin A rescued viral expression, as demonstrated by in vivo infectivity trials. Comparing silent and reactivated provirus, we found mechanistic connections between chromatin conformation and tumor-associated transcriptional repression. Silencing is associated with DNA methylation and decreased accessibility of promoter sequences. HDAC1 and the transcriptional corepressor mSin3A are associated with the inactive but not the reactivated promoter. Silencing correlates with a repressed chromatin structure marked by histone H3 and H4 hypoacetylation, a loss of methylation at H3 lysine 4, and an increase of H3 lysine 9 methylation. These observations point to the critical role of epigenetic mechanisms in tumor-specific virus/oncogene silencing, a potential strategy to evade immune response and favor the propagation of the transformed cell.","['Merimi, Makram', 'Klener, Pavel', 'Szynal, Maud', 'Cleuter, Yvette', 'Kerkhofs, Pierre', 'Burny, Arsene', 'Martiat, Philippe', 'Van den Broeke, Anne']","['Merimi M', 'Klener P', 'Szynal M', 'Cleuter Y', 'Kerkhofs P', 'Burny A', 'Martiat P', 'Van den Broeke A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC1900279,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(11):5929-39. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02606-06.

However, in the absence of packageable viral RNA, assembly is still efficient, and the released virus-like particles (termed ""Psi-"" particles) still contain roughly normal amounts of RNA. We have proposed that cellular mRNAs replace the genome in Psi- particles. We have now analyzed the mRNA content of Psi- and Psi+ murine leukemia virus (MLV) particles using both microarray analysis and real-time reverse transcription-PCR. The majority of mRNA species present in the virus-producing cells were also detected in Psi- particles. Remarkably, nearly all of them were packaged nonselectively; that is, their representation in the particles was simply proportional to their representation in the cells. However, a small number of low-abundance mRNAs were greatly enriched in the particles. In fact, one mRNA species was enriched to the same degree as Psi+ genomic RNA. Similar results were obtained with particles formed from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag protein, and the same mRNAs were enriched in MLV and HIV-1 particles. The levels of individual cellular mRNAs were approximately 5- to 10-fold higher in Psi- than in Psi+ MLV particles, in agreement with the idea that they are replacing viral RNA in the former. In contrast, signal recognition particle RNA was present at the same level in Psi- and Psi+ particles; a minor fraction of this RNA was weakly associated with genomic RNA in Psi+ MLV particles.","['Rulli, Samuel J Jr', 'Hibbert, Catherine S', 'Mirro, Jane', 'Pederson, Thoru', 'Biswal, Shyam', 'Rein, Alan']","['Rulli SJ Jr', 'Hibbert CS', 'Mirro J', 'Pederson T', 'Biswal S', 'Rein A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC1900105,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/12 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(12):6623-31. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02833-06.

Autoimmunity directed against hematopoietic precursor cells is the hallmark of aplastic anemia, but many features of this disease are shared by two related disorders, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). While the clinical associations between hematological malignancy and autoimmunity have been described many decades ago, only in the last several years have the common pathogenetic mechanisms been elucidated. We summarize the recent progress made in understanding how hematological malignancy gives rise to autoimmunity directed against blood cells and vice versa, and illustrate parallels in the etiology of malignant and autoimmune hematological disorders.

The consequences of different treatments, particularly chemotherapy, were of interest. Follow-up data for 291 patients from a cohort of 360 patients were available and analysed in this retrospective study. Impaired thyroid function occurred in 71/291 (24%) patients: brain tumours 30/65 (46%), Hodgkin's disease (HD) 10/21 (48%), leukaemia/non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) 19/140 (14%) and others 12/65 (18%). Patients with brain tumours had a higher hazard ratio (HR) over leukaemia/NHL (HR 7.47) but not over HD (HR 1.57). These patients also developed thyroid hypofunction earlier than patients with HD or leukaemia/NHL. Age at diagnosis did not have an effect on the occurrence or timeframe of development of thyroid hypofunction. Radiotherapy (HR 4.68) and radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy (HR 2.90) were associated with a higher risk than chemotherapy alone. Chemotherapy added to radiotherapy tended to increase risk (HR 2.42 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-5.87).

Studies have shown that the HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax is available for immune recognition by antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as dendritic cells (DCs). DCs are relevant to the pathogenesis of HAM/TSP because the presentation of Tax peptides by activated DCs to naive CD8(+) T cells may play an important role in the induction of the Tax-specific immune response that is observed in HAM/TSP. In this study, a human cytokine protein array was used to study the secretion of cytokines by monocyte-derived DCs (MDDCs) exposed to Tax. Of the 16 cytokines analyzed, 6 cytokines were secreted in significantly high amounts (> or =2-fold), including Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12, and TNF-alpha) and C-C chemokines (Eotaxin, MCP-1, and MCP-3). Selected cytokines were further examined at two concentrations of Tax and at two time periods. Furthermore, a transient exposure to Tax did not result in any cytokine production when examined at three different time points after exposure, indicating that a prolonged presence of Tax is required for its activity. Finally, inhibition of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by specific inhibitors, abrogated Tax-mediated cytokine secretion. Collectively, these findings suggest a role for Tax-induced cytokine secretion from MDDCs, which may be critical for the cellular activation and tissue damage that has been observed in HAM/TSP.","['Ahuja, Jaya', 'Lepoutre, Veronique', 'Wigdahl, Brian', 'Khan, Zafar K', 'Jain, Pooja']","['Ahuja J', 'Lepoutre V', 'Wigdahl B', 'Khan ZK', 'Jain P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,PMC2043123,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 2007 May;61(4):201-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biopha.2007.02.006.

However, malignant blood cells in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) display low levels of ligands for the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D and can thus evade NK immunosurveillance. We examined the possibility of up-regulating NKG2D-specific UL16-binding protein (ULBP) ligands using anti-neoplastic compounds with myeloid differentiation potential. Combinations of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, trichostatin A, vitamin D3, bryostatin-1, and all-trans-retinoic acid, used together with myeloid growth factors and interferon-gamma, increased cell surface ULBP expression up to 10-fold in the AML cell line HL60 and in primary AML blasts. Up-regulation of ULBP ligands was associated with induction of myelomonocytic differentiation of AML cells. Higher ULBP expression increased NKG2D-dependent sensitivity of HL60 cells to NK-mediated killing. These findings identify NKG2D ligands as targets of leukemia differentiation therapy and suggest a clinical benefit in combining a pharmacological approach with NK cell-based immunotherapy in AML.","['Rohner, Andreas', 'Langenkamp, Ulrich', 'Siegler, Uwe', 'Kalberer, Christian P', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz, Aleksandra']","['Rohner A', 'Langenkamp U', 'Siegler U', 'Kalberer CP', 'Wodnar-Filipowicz A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/06/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Oct;31(10):1393-402. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.02.020.

But in addition, these tricyclic molecules often display secondary effects on other biochemical pathways including protein metabolism. In order to identify novel anti-cancer drugs, we evaluated the mechanism of action of a novel series of bis- and tetra-acridines. As expected, these molecules were found to interact with DNA and inhibit the topoisomerase II-mediated DNA decatenation. Interestingly when tested on human tumour cells either sensitive (HL-60) or resistant (HL-60/MX2) to topoisomerase II inhibitors, these molecules proved equicytotoxic against the two cell lines, suggesting that they do not only rely on topoisomerase II inhibition to exert their cytotoxic effects. In order to identify alternative targets, we tested the capacity of acridines 1-9 to inhibit the proteasome machinery. Four tetra-acridines inhibited the proteasome in vitro, with IC(50) values up to 40 times lower than that of the reference proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Moreover, unlike peptide aldehydes used as reference inhibitors for the proteasome, these new acridine compounds demonstrated a good selectivity towards the proteasome, when tested against four unrelated proteases. A cellular assay based on the degradation of a proteasome protein substrate indicated that at least two of the tetra-acridines maintained this proteasome inhibition activity in a cellular context. This is the first report of tetra-acridines that demonstrate dual topoisomerase II and proteasome inhibition properties. This new dual activity could represent a novel anti-cancer approach to circumvent certain forms of tumour resistance.","['Vispe, S', 'Vandenberghe, I', 'Robin, M', 'Annereau, J P', 'Creancier, L', 'Pique, V', 'Galy, J P', 'Kruczynski, A', 'Barret, J M', 'Bailly, C']","['Vispe S', 'Vandenberghe I', 'Robin M', 'Annereau JP', 'Creancier L', 'Pique V', 'Galy JP', 'Kruczynski A', 'Barret JM', 'Bailly C']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2006/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2007 Jun 15;73(12):1863-72. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2007.02.016.

Our results suggest that limited chronic GVHD provides a survival benefit to patients with haematological malignancies by reducing the risk of relapse without increasing the risk of death from chronic GVHD.","['Ozawa, Shinichi', 'Nakaseko, Chiaki', 'Nishimura, Miki', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Cho, Ryuko', 'Ohwada, Chikako', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Mori, Shin-ichiro', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Miyamura, Kouichi', 'Kato, Shunichi', 'Kawase, Takakazu', 'Morishima, Yasuo', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa']","['Ozawa S', 'Nakaseko C', 'Nishimura M', 'Maruta A', 'Cho R', 'Ohwada C', 'Sakamaki H', 'Sao H', 'Mori S', 'Okamoto S', 'Miyamura K', 'Kato S', 'Kawase T', 'Morishima Y', 'Kodera Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Apr;137(2):142-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06543.x.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Severity of Illness Index']","['BJH6543 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06543.x [doi]']",,"['Division of Haematology, Department of Clinical Cell Biology, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,['Japan Marrow Donor Program'],,,,,,,

Many cases have additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and often have a complex karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to study 60 cases with leukaemic presentation of MCL, to determine the frequency, clinical correlations and prognostic impact of a panel of molecular cytogenetic abnormalities: 17p13 (TP53 locus), 13q14, 12 p11.1-q11 (centromere), 6q21 and 11q23. CD38 expression, of prognostic value in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), was also studied, and correlations with clinical and cytogenetic abnormalities sought. Eighty per cent of cases had at least one abnormality in addition to t(11;14). Deletions at 17p13 (TP53) and 13q14 were most frequent and involved the majority of the leukaemic clone. Cases with TP53 deletion were more likely to have splenomegaly and marked leucocytosis (>30 x 10(9)/l), and less likely to have lymphadenopathy than those without deletion. Deletions at 11q23 and 6q21 were associated with extranodal disease. 13q14 and 11q23 deletions showed a trend towards worse prognosis by univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, deletions at 13q14 and 6q21 were independent predictors of poor outcome. Deletion at 17p13 did not show prognostic impact in this series. CD38, positive in two-thirds of cases, was associated with male gender and nodal disease but not with any cytogenetic abnormality, or with survival.","['Parry-Jones, N', 'Matutes, E', 'Morilla, R', 'Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Catovsky, D']","['Parry-Jones N', 'Matutes E', 'Morilla R', 'Brito-Babapulle V', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Catovsky D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Apr;137(2):117-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06526.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Translocation, Genetic']","['BJH6526 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06526.x [doi]']",,"['Section of Haemato-Oncology, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Trust, London and Surrey, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its incidence and severity depends on several factors, such as prophylaxis method, donor/recipient matching, intensity of the conditioning regimen and composition of the graft. Significant progress has been made in recent years in understanding the pathogenesis of the disease, and some of these advances have been translated into clinical trials. First-line treatment of acute GvHD is based on corticosteroids, and produce sustained responses in 50-80% of patients depending on the initial severity. Non-responders are offered second-line therapy, with combinations of immunosuppressive agents, but 1-year survival is 30% in most large trials. New strategies explored include infusion of expanded mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), down regulation of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and suicide gene transduced T cells. Acute GvHD is complicated by severe immunodeficiency causing life-threatening infections. To date, GvHD has not been differentiated from the graft-versus-leukaemia effect.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 327 consecutive patients with de novo AML (promyelocytic leukaemia excluded) aged 16-65 yr were recruited into the study between September 1992 and December 2001. The latest follow-up data were collected in October 2006. After remission achievement with the first (conventional cytarabine) or second (high-dose cytarabine) chemotherapy cycle, three intensive consolidation courses each containing high- or intermediate-dose cytarabine were given. RESULTS: A total of 268 patients (82%) achieved complete remission (CR). CR rate was 82% and 84% for patients <60 and > or =60 yr of age, respectively. CR rates in patients with favourable (93%) and intermediate/normal karyotypes (87%) were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than CR rate in patients with adverse karyotype (61%). Median relapse-free survival (RFS) for the patients not transplanted in the first CR (n = 195) was 1.7 yr (95% CI: 0.81-2.60). At 4 yr, a plateau of 70% in RFS was reached for patients with favourable karyotypes. The 5-yr survival was 71%, 47% and 37% for the non-transplanted patients (n = 202) with favourable, intermediate/normal and intermediate/abnormal karyotypes, respectively, while only 8% of the patients having adverse karyotype were alive at 5 yr (P < 0.01). Of the patients with favourable, intermediate/normal or intermediate/abnormal karyotypes, respectively, 58%, 41% and 31% were expected to be alive at 10 yr.

Several studies have shown that bone marrow-derived endothelial cells (EC) may contribute to tumour angiogenesis and that in the peripheral blood of cancer patients there is an increased amount of circulating ECs (CECs) that may participate to new vessel formation. In this report, we showed that, in seven acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients with known cytogenetic abnormalities, CEC levels were significantly increased in comparison with controls and that a significant proportion of these CECs carried the same chromosomal aberration as blast cells (20-78%, mean value 42.1% of CECs). Most of CECs (mean value 74.4%) displayed immunophenotypic features of endothelial progenitor cells as they expressed CD133, a marker gradually lost during EC differentiation and absent on mature EC. These findings suggest a possible direct contribution of AML-related CECs to tumour vasculogenesis and possibly to the spreading and progression of the disease.","['Rigolin, Gian Matteo', 'Mauro, Endri', 'Ciccone, Maria', 'Fraulini, Chiara', 'Sofritti, Olga', 'Castoldi, Gianluigi', 'Cuneo, Antonio']","['Rigolin GM', 'Mauro E', 'Ciccone M', 'Fraulini C', 'Sofritti O', 'Castoldi G', 'Cuneo A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,2007/03/30 09:00,2007/05/18 09:00,['2007/03/30 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2007 May;78(5):365-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2007.00839.x.

Adjusting for sex and benzene, the RR of leukemia for workers receiving more than 10 mSv was higher compared to those receiving lower or no dose; however, the risk increase was attenuated in the highest dose group. The ERR per 10 mSv was 1.44% (95% CI: < -1.03%, 7.59%) but was higher for workers born after 1921 compared to workers born earlier or when excluding leukemias of uncertain type.

More than a third of subjects had at least one allergy diagnosed prior to leukaemia diagnosis (cases) or pseudo-diagnosis (controls). For both total acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and common-ALL/precursor B-cell ALL (c-ALL), a history of eczema was associated with a 30% significant reduction in risk: the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were 0.70 (0.51-0.97) and 0.68 (0.48-0.98), respectively.

No such patterns were seen either for asthma and ALL, or for any allergy and acute myeloid leukaemia. A comparative analysis of primary care records with parents recall of allergy revealed only moderate agreement with contemporaneous clinical diagnoses for both cases and controls--confirming the unreliability of parental report at interview.

The same effect applies to an even greater degree in proteomics, especially with the use of MS for parallel measurements. Biological effects such as PTM, fragmentation, and multimer formation can produce strongly correlated variables. The problem is compounded in some types of MS by technical effects such as incomplete chromatographic separation, binding to multiple surfaces, or multiple ionizations. Existing methods for dimension reduction, notably principal components analysis and related techniques, are not always satisfactory because they produce data that often lack clear biological interpretation. We propose a preprocessing algorithm that clusters highly correlated features, using the Bayes information criterion to select an optimal number of clusters. Statistical analysis of clusters, instead of individual features, benefits from lower noise, and reduces the difficulties associated with strongly correlated data. This preprocessing increases the statistical power of analyses using false discovery rate on simulated data. Strong correlations are often present in real data, and we find that clustering improves biomarker discovery in clinical SELDI-TOF-MS datasets of plasma from patients with Kawasaki disease, and bone-marrow cell extracts from patients with acute myeloid or acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Carlson, Scott M', 'Najmi, Amir', 'Cohen, Harvey J']","['Carlson SM', 'Najmi A', 'Cohen HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/10/19 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proteomics. 2007 Apr;7(7):1037-46. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200600514.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,,"['*Algorithms', 'Bayes Theorem', 'Biomarkers', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis', '*Proteomics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization']",['10.1002/pmic.200600514 [doi]'],,"['Biological Engineering Division, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We generated a monoclonal antibody against CD47 (mAb-MABL) that possibly induced apoptosis from the ligation of CD47 in CCRF-CEM and JOK-1 cells in vitro. To confirm whether the ligation of CD47 caused cell death in vivo, we examined the antitumor activity of F(ab')2 of mAb-MABL in two xenograft models: The acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) and the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (JOK-1) cell line.

Directing CD8+ T lymphocytes specifically to R3 might help to shape the graft-versus-leukemia effect observed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT). To detect the potential induction of R3-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients after allo-SCT and healthy donors, we used mixed lymphocyte peptide culture, enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) release assays for interferon (IFN)-gamma and granzyme B, tetramer staining and 51Cr release cytotoxicity assays. The R3 peptide showed the capacity to elicit specific CD8+ T cell responses characterized by the release of IFN-gamma and granzyme B upon stimulation with R3-pulsed T2 cells. Responses to R3 peptide were detected in 67% (6/9) of the CML patients after allo-SCT and 24% (8/34) of healthy donors in ELISPOT assays for IFN-gamma and granzyme B. These R3-specific CD8+ T cells comprised predominantly effector cells (CCR7-CD45RA+ or CD27-CD45RA+) in patients with CML after allo-SCT or healthy donors respectively. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated effective lysis of CML progenitor cells by R3-primed CD8+ T lymphocytes. Imatinib inhibited the functional activation of R3-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. In summary, we demonstrated R3-specific CD8+ effector T lymphocytes after allo-SCT in CML patients which might have been augumented by R3 peptide vaccination and hampered at least partially by imatinib in this particular patient cohort.","['Chen, Jinfei', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Chen J', 'Schmitt A', 'Bunjes D', 'Chen B', 'Schmitt M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/07/18 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 May;30(5):1119-27.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,,"['Benzamides', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epitopes/chemistry', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*chemistry', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*chemistry', 'Hyaluronic Acid/*chemistry', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,"['Key Laboratory of Developmental Genes and Human Disease, Ministry of Education, Southeast University Medical School, Nanjing, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations to AFFs can disrupt lymphopoesis, CNS development and spermatogenesis. However, despite the growing list of pathologies linked to AFF members, their evolutionary relationship and the structure/function of individual members, remain to be elucidated. Here, we first report that database mining and phylogenetic analysis with AFF proteins from multiple species, revealed two monophyletic sister clades, suggesting a common Bilateria ancestor. We then examined the structure/function of the most recently discovered AFF member, MCEF (also known as AF5q31 or AFF4). In silico, the human MCEF gene was found to have 21 exons, and code for a protein with seven nuclear localization sequences (NLS). In HeLa cells, an MCEF-EGFP fusion protein, localized exclusively to the nucleus. Consequently, we made twenty constructs, expressing MCEF deletion mutants fused to EGFP and/or DsRed fluorescent proteins. Three distinct protein sequences, encoded by three separate MCEF exons, were found to mediate nuclear localization, only two of which were predicted in silico. Importantly, we also found that ectopic expression of MCEF, repressed HIV-1 LTR-directed RNA Polymerase II transcription, at the level of Tat-transactivation. We suggest that portions of MCEF could be exploited for chimeric transcription factor repression (CTFR) of HIV-1.","['Niedzielski, Maksymilian F', 'Hopewell, Robert', 'Ismail, Zohra', 'Estable, Mario C']","['Niedzielski MF', 'Hopewell R', 'Ismail Z', 'Estable MC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,PMC1820876,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2006/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2007 Mar 1;3(4):225-36. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.3.225.,"['0 (AFF4 protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (tat peptide (1-72), Human immunodeficiency virus 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Products, tat/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Invertebrates/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/classification/*genetics', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology', 'Species Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors', 'Vertebrates/genetics', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",['10.7150/ijbs.3.225 [doi]'],,"['Ryerson University, Department of Chemistry & Biology, Toronto, Ontario, M5B2K3, Canada.']",,,20070301,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The syndrome associated with t(8;13)(p11;q12) results in expression of the ZNF198-FGFR1 fusion tyrosine kinase that plays a pathogenic role in hematopoietic transformation. We found that ZNF198-FGFR1 activated both the AKT and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) prosurvival signaling pathways, resulting in elevated phosphorylation of the AKT target FOXO3a at T32 and BAD at S112, respectively. These phosphorylated residues subsequently sequestered the proapoptotic FOXO3a and BAD to 14-3-3 to prevent apoptosis. We used a peptide-based 14-3-3 competitive antagonist, R18, to disrupt 14-3-3-ligand association. Expression of R18 effectively induced apoptosis in hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells transformed by ZNF198-FGFR1 compared with control cells. Moreover, purified recombinant transactivator of transcription (TAT)-conjugated R18 proteins effectively transduced into human leukemia cells and induced significant apoptosis in KG-1a cells expressing FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 fusion tyrosine kinase but not in control HL-60 and Jurkat T cells. Surprisingly, R18 was only able to dissociate FOXO3a, but not BAD as previously proposed, from 14-3-3 binding and induced apoptosis partially through liberation and reactivation of FOXO3a. Our findings suggest that 14-3-3 integrates prosurvival signals in FGFR1 fusion-transformed hematopoietic cells.

These abnormalities are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of leukemia; however, the molecular events leading to these abnormalities are not fully understood. We show here that the Abi1 pathway is required for Bcr-Abl to stimulate actin cytoskeleton remodeling, integrin clustering and cell adhesion. Expression of Bcr-Abl induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Abi1. This is accompanied by a subcellular translocation of Abi1/WAVE2 to a site adjacent to membrane, where an F-actin-enriched structure containing the adhesion molecules such as beta1-integrin, paxillin and vinculin is assembled. Bcr-Abl-induced membrane translocation of Abi1/WAVE2 requires direct interaction between Abi1 and Bcr-Abl, but is independent of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway. Formation of the F-actin-rich complex correlates with an increased cell adhesion to fibronectin. More importantly, disruption of the interaction between Bcr-Abl and Abi1 by mutations either in Bcr-Abl or Abi1 not only abolished tyrosine phosphorylation of Abi1 and membrane translocation of Abi1/WAVE2, but also inhibited Bcr-Abl-stimulated actin cytoskeleton remodeling, integrin clustering and cell adhesion to fibronectin. Together, these data define Abi1/WAVE2 as a downstream pathway that contributes to Bcr-Abl-induced abnormalities of cytoskeletal and integrin function.","['Li, Yingzhu', 'Clough, Nancy', 'Sun, Xiaolin', 'Yu, Weidong', 'Abbott, Brian L', 'Hogan, Christopher J', 'Dai, Zonghan']","['Li Y', 'Clough N', 'Sun X', 'Yu W', 'Abbott BL', 'Hogan CJ', 'Dai Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,PMC1950936,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 2007 Apr 15;120(Pt 8):1436-46. doi: 10.1242/jcs.03430.

We show, in applications to the analysis of leukemia and lung cancer data sets, how this approach can help assess and interpret similarities and differences between independent data sets, enable cross-platform and cross-species analysis, improve clustering and class prediction, and provide a computational means to detect and remove sample contamination.","['Tamayo, Pablo', 'Scanfeld, Daniel', 'Ebert, Benjamin L', 'Gillette, Michael A', 'Roberts, Charles W M', 'Mesirov, Jill P']","['Tamayo P', 'Scanfeld D', 'Ebert BL', 'Gillette MA', 'Roberts CW', 'Mesirov JP']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC1838404,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Apr 3;104(14):5959-64. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0701068104.

Therefore, the German CLL Study Group assessed HRQOL in younger patients with advanced CLL receiving first-line chemotherapy with fludarabine or fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide (FC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy-five patients younger than 66 years with advanced CLL were randomly assigned to receive either fludarabine alone (fludarabine 25 mg/m2/d for 5 days intravenously [IV], repeated every 28 days) or FC (fludarabine 30 mg/m2/d for 3 days IV plus cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2/d for 3 days, repeated every 28 days). Six courses of treatment were planned to be administered. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 was sent to all patients at baseline and after 6, 12, and 24 months. RESULTS: Eighty-nine percent of 362 included patients completed at least one questionnaire (163 fludarabine- and 158 FC-treated patients). Comparing the baseline levels of 249 CLL patients with the general German population, significant differences in nearly all HRQOL scales were assessed between the two groups. A multivariate analysis showed no significant differences in all HRQOL scales between both arms. In both treatment arms, symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, and appetite loss improved to lower levels after the end chemotherapy. Except for lower physical status, no significant difference in HRQOL between male and female patients was evaluated. CONCLUSION: Fludarabine-based treatment seems to improve HRQOL little to moderately in younger patients with advanced CLL. No significant difference between fludarabine- and FC-treated patients was observed.","['Eichhorst, Barbara F', 'Busch, Raymonde', 'Obwandner, Tanja', 'Kuhn-Hallek, Ingrid', 'Herschbach, Peter', 'Hallek, Michael']","['Eichhorst BF', 'Busch R', 'Obwandner T', 'Kuhn-Hallek I', 'Herschbach P', 'Hallek M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 May 1;25(13):1722-31. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.05.6929.

Valproic acid (VPA), a commonly used antiseizure and mood stabilizer drug, has been shown to cause growth arrest and induce differentiation of malignant cells via HDAC inhibition. VPA causes selective proteasomal degradation of HDAC2 but not other class I HDACs (i.e., HDAC 1, 3, and 8). Therefore, we raised the question of whether this drug can effectively target the leukemogenic activity of the AML1/ETO fusion protein that also recruits HDAC1, a key regulator of normal and aberrant histone acetylation. We report here that VPA treatment disrupts the AML1/ETO-HDAC1 physical interaction, stimulates the global dissociation of AML1/ETO-HDAC1 complex from the promoter of AML1/ETO target genes, and induces relocation of both AML1/ETO and HDAC1 protein from nuclear to perinuclear region. Furthermore, we show that mechanistically these effects associate with a significant inhibition of HDAC activity, histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation, and recruitment of RNA polymerase II, leading to transcriptional reactivation of target genes (i.e., IL-3) otherwise silenced by AML1/ETO fusion protein. Ultimately, these pharmacological effects resulted in significant antileukemic activity mediated by partial cell differentiation and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, these data support the notion that VPA might effectively target AML1/ETO-driven leukemogenesis through disruption of aberrant HDAC1 function and that VPA should be integrated in novel therapeutic approaches for AML1/ETO-positive AML.","['Liu, Shujun', 'Klisovic, Rebecca B', 'Vukosavljevic, Tamara', 'Yu, Jianhua', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Huynh, Lenguyen', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Neviani, Paolo', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Blum, William', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Marcucci, Guido']","['Liu S', 'Klisovic RB', 'Vukosavljevic T', 'Yu J', 'Paschka P', 'Huynh L', 'Pang J', 'Neviani P', 'Liu Z', 'Blum W', 'Chan KK', 'Perrotti D', 'Marcucci G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Jun;321(3):953-60. doi: 10.1124/jpet.106.118406.

There are many cluster detection methods used in spatial epidemiology to investigate suspicious groupings of cancer occurrences in regional count data and case-control data, where controls are sampled from the at-risk population. Numerous studies in the literature have focused on childhood leukemia because of its relatively large incidence among children compared with other malignant diseases and substantial public concern over elevated leukemia incidence. The main focus of this paper is an analysis of the spatial distribution of leukemia incidence among children from 0 to 14 years of age in Ohio from 1996-2003 using individual case data from the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System (OCISS).Specifically, we explore whether there is statistically significant global clustering and if there are statistically significant local clusters of individual leukemia cases in Ohio using numerous published methods of spatial cluster detection, including spatial point process summary methods, a nearest neighbor method, and a local rate scanning method. We use the K function, Cuzick and Edward's method, and the kernel intensity function to test for significant global clustering and the kernel intensity function and Kulldorff's spatial scan statistic in SaTScan to test for significant local clusters. RESULTS: We found some evidence, although inconclusive, of significant local clusters in childhood leukemia in Ohio, but no significant overall clustering. The findings from the local cluster detection analyses are not consistent for the different cluster detection techniques, where the spatial scan method in SaTScan does not find statistically significant local clusters, while the kernel intensity function method suggests statistically significant clusters in areas of central, southern, and eastern Ohio. The findings are consistent for the different tests of global clustering, where no significant clustering is demonstrated with any of the techniques when all age cases are considered together. CONCLUSION: This comparative study for childhood leukemia clustering and clusters in Ohio revealed several research issues in practical spatial cluster detection. Among them, flexibility in cluster shape detection should be an issue for consideration.","['Wheeler, David C']",['Wheeler DC'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Int J Health Geogr,International journal of health geographics,101152198,PMC1851703,2007/03/29 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/29 09:00'],"['2007/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,Int J Health Geogr. 2007 Mar 27;6:13. doi: 10.1186/1476-072X-6-13.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Geographic Information Systems/*organization & administration', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Ohio/epidemiology', 'Registries']","['1476-072X-6-13 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-072X-6-13 [doi]']",,"['Department of Biostatistics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. dcwheel@sph.emory.edu']",,,20070327,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since evidence has shown that PPI can increase the de novo germline mutation rate in hypervariable minisatellite loci, we investigated the hypothesis that sporadic childhood leukaemia might be associated with an increased parental germline minisatellite mutation rate. To test this hypothesis, we compared de novo germline mutation rates in the hypervariable minisatellite locus, CEB1, in family trios (both parents and their child) of children with leukaemia (n=135) compared with unaffected control families (n=124). The majority of case and control germline mutations were paternal (94%); the mean paternal germline mutation rates of children with leukaemia (0.083) and control children (0.156) were not significantly different (odds ratio, 95% confidence interval: 0.50, 0.23-1.08; P=0.11).

Despite modifications to existing vectors, concerns have arisen regarding the risk of genotoxicity associated with the use of retroviruses. To address safety concerns, we propose that expression of a cell surface protein, human CD25 (huCD25) in a bicistronic format, with any therapeutic gene such as alpha-gal A can provide a target that can be used to kill transduced cells selectively should transformative events occur. We show that an anti-CD25 antibody and immunotoxin can specifically target and eliminate transduced leukemia cells expressing CD25. In a murine leukemia model, antibody treatment reduced tumor burden 32-fold and increased survival compared with untreated mice. Furthermore, after a bone marrow transplant of therapeutically transduced cells into Fabry mice, antibody treatment reduced the number of retrovirally transduced huCD25-expressing cells in the peripheral blood. A systemic loss of transduced cells with functional consequences was also evident in the liver and spleen. This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that a targeted antibody can reduce tumor burden and selectively clear bicistronically transduced hematopoietic cells that express a target antigen, thus acting as a built-in safety mechanism.","['Ramsubir, Shobha', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Medin, Jeffrey A']","['Ramsubir S', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Medin JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2007 Jun;15(6):1174-81. doi: 10.1038/sj.mt.6300147.

They manifest a distinct biologic behavior that ranges from indolent to very aggressive. METHODS: We discuss four distinct diseases involving LGLs: indolent T-cell LGL leukemia, aggressive T-cell LGL leukemia, chronic NK-cell leukemia, and aggressive NK-cell leukemia. Furthermore, we present an up-to-date systematic review of therapies for each entity. RESULTS: Sustained LGLs, characteristic immunophenotype, clonal origin of leukemic cells, and clinical presentation are the most important features that distinguish indolent from aggressive subtypes of LGL leukemia and guide the selection of therapy. Patients with symptomatic indolent T-cell or NK-cell LGL leukemia are usually treated with immunosuppressive therapies in contrast to aggressive T-cell and NK-cell LGL leukemia, which require intensive chemotherapy induction regimens. Novel targeted therapies using monoclonal antibodies against receptors, including CD2, CD52, the beta subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor, and small molecules such as tipifarnib, are undergoing evaluation in clinical trials.

The mechanisms of leukemogenesis have not been fully clarified. METHODS: The authors reviewed the virological, clinical, and immunological features of HTLV-I and ATL and summarized recent findings on the oncogenic mechanisms of ATL and therapeutic advances. RESULTS: Multiple factors, such as viral genes, genetic and epigenetic alterations, and the host immune system, may be implicated in the leukemogenesis of ATL. Among them, viral genes, tax, and HBZ have been thought to play important roles. The prognosis of aggressive-type ATL remains poor, regardless of intensive chemotherapy. Effectiveness of allogeneic stem cell transplantation for ATL has been recently reported. CONCLUSIONS: Although the precise mechanism of leukemogenesis of ATL remains unclear, recent progress provides important clues in oncogenesis by HTLV-I.

To characterize the mechanism of transformation by FLT3-ITDs, we sequenced the juxtamembrane region (JM) of FLT3 from 284 patients with acute leukemias. The length of FLT3-ITDs varied from 2 to 42 amino acids (AAs) with a median of 17 AAs. The analysis of duplicated AAs showed that in the majority of patients, the duplications localize between AAs 591 to 599 (YVDFREYEY). Arginine 595 (R595) within this region is duplicated in 77% of patients. Single duplication of R595 in FLT3 conferred factor-independent growth to Ba/F3 cells and activated STAT5. Moreover, deletion or substitution of the duplicated R595 in 2 FLT3-ITD constructs as well as the deletion of wild-type R595 in FLT3-ITD substantially reduced the transforming potential and STAT5 activation, pointing to a critical role of the positive charge of R595 in stabilizing the active confirmation of FLT3-ITDs. Deletion of R595 in FLT3-WT nearly abrogated the ligand-dependent activation of FLT3-WT. Our data provide important insights into the molecular mechanism of transformation by FLT3-ITDs and show that duplication of R595 is important for the leukemic potential of FLT3-ITDs.","['Vempati, Sridhar', 'Reindl, Carola', 'Kaza, Seshu Kumar', 'Kern, Ruth', 'Malamoussi, Theodora', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Mellert, Gudrun', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Vempati S', 'Reindl C', 'Kaza SK', 'Kern R', 'Malamoussi T', 'Dugas M', 'Mellert G', 'Schnittger S', 'Hiddemann W', 'Spiekermann K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):686-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-053181.

Here, we report that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) was required for Mcl-1 degradation, and we identified a novel mechanism for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 turnover in which GSK-3beta associates with and phosphorylates Mcl-1 at one consensus motif ((155)STDG(159)SLPS(163)T; phosphorylation sites are in italics), which will lead to the association of Mcl-1 with the E3 ligase beta-TrCP, and beta-TrCP then facilitates the ubiquitination and degradation of phosphorylated Mcl-1. A variant of Mcl-1 (Mcl-1-3A), which abolishes the phosphorylations by GSK-3beta and then cannot be ubiquitinated by beta-TrCP, is much more stable than wild-type Mcl-1 and able to block the proapoptotic function of GSK-3beta and enhance chemoresistance. Our results indicate that the turnover of Mcl-1 by beta-TrCP is an essential mechanism for GSK-3beta-induced apoptosis and contributes to GSK-3beta-mediated tumor suppression and chemosensitization.","['Ding, Qingqing', 'He, Xianghuo', 'Hsu, Jung-Mao', 'Xia, Weiya', 'Chen, Chun-Te', 'Li, Long-Yuan', 'Lee, Dung-Fang', 'Liu, Jaw-Ching', 'Zhong, Qing', 'Wang, Xiaodong', 'Hung, Mien-Chie']","['Ding Q', 'He X', 'Hsu JM', 'Xia W', 'Chen CT', 'Li LY', 'Lee DF', 'Liu JC', 'Zhong Q', 'Wang X', 'Hung MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC1900029,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Jun;27(11):4006-17. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00620-06.

We have recently proposed, that specific karyotypic alterations are sufficient for drug resistance via new transcriptomes of cooperative genes, independent of gene mutation. This mechanism generates new phenotypes just like trisomy 21 generates Down syndrome. These karyotypic changes are generated by cancer-specific aneuploidy autocatalytically, because aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype by misbalancing teams of proteins that synthesize, repair and segregate chromosomes. Evidence for this chromosomal mechanism is as follows: (i) resistance is proportional to the number of clonal chromosomal alterations compared to drug-sensitive precursors. (ii) The high rates at which cancer cells acquire drug resistance are comparable with the rates, as high as 10(-2) per cell generation, at which their karyotypes change-dimming hopes for gene-specific therapies. (iii) Multidrug resistance probably reflects un-selected transcriptomes of karyotypes selected for resistance against specific drugs. (iv) Intrinsic drug resistance probably reflects unselected transcriptomes of karyotypes selected for oncogenicity. We also adduce evidence that resistance of chronic myeloid leukemia against the drug imatinib is chromosomal, although it is widely believed to be due to mutation of a kinase.","['Duesberg, Peter', 'Li, Ruhong', 'Sachs, Rainer', 'Fabarius, Alice', 'Upender, Madhvi B', 'Hehlmann, Ruediger']","['Duesberg P', 'Li R', 'Sachs R', 'Fabarius A', 'Upender MB', 'Hehlmann R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Scotland,Drug Resist Updat,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,9815369,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/06/27 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Resist Updat. 2007 Feb-Apr;10(1-2):51-8. doi: 10.1016/j.drup.2007.02.003.

Previously, we reported the isolation of a trypsin inhibitor from Peltophorum dubium seeds (PDTI). This inhibitor, as well as soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI), both belonging to the Kunitz family, have lectin-like properties and trigger rat lymphoma cell apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that PDTI and SBTI induce human leukemia Jurkat cell death. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by flow cytometry after propidium iodide labeling of apoptotic nuclei, showing a considerable increase of the sub G(0)/G(1) fraction, with no cell cycle arrest. With the purpose of gaining insight into the signaling pathways involved, we investigated the activation of caspases and the effect of caspase inhibitors, and showed caspases-3 and -8-like activation by PDTI or SBTI-treatment. Consistent with these results, pan caspase inhibitor and caspase-8 inhibitor protected Jurkat cells from apoptosis. However, there was no caspase-9 activation, confirmed by the failure of caspase-9 inhibitor to prevent cell death. No significant release of cytochrome c from mitochondria was detected suggesting that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is not predominant in the apoptotic process. On the other hand, recruitment of Fas-associated death domain (FADD) to the cell membrane indicates the involvement of this adaptor protein in PDTI- and SBTI-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells. Furthermore, human peripheral lymphocytes, either stimulated with phytohemagglutinin or not, are also susceptible to viability decrease induced by these inhibitors.","['Troncoso, Maria F', 'Biron, Veronica A', 'Longhi, Silvia A', 'Retegui, Lilia A', 'Wolfenstein-Todel, Carlota']","['Troncoso MF', 'Biron VA', 'Longhi SA', 'Retegui LA', 'Wolfenstein-Todel C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2006/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/27 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2007 May;7(5):625-36. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2007.01.002.

Here we report that parthenolide reduced both basal and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-induced STAT3 tyrosine 705 (Y705) phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes in a dose-dependent manner, but stimulated the MAP kinase signaling pathways. Activation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) tyrosine kinase was markedly reduced by parthenolide. Pretreatment with parthenolide inhibited JAK1-mediated phosphorylation of the LIF receptor subunits LIF receptor (LIFR) alpha and glycoprotein 130 (gp130), and reduced the LIF-induced increase in JAK1 association with both components. In addition, we documented that parthenolide, over the same concentration range, does not have a direct inhibitory effect on JAK1 autophosphorylation. However, we observed that parthenolide increased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment with the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, completely suppressed the effect of parthenolide on JAK1 and STAT3. From these results, we conclude ROS generation in cardiomyocytes blocks STAT3 signaling of the IL-6-type cytokines by targeting JAK1. The finding that signaling by the IL-6-type cytokine may be redox-sensitive defines a novel mechanism of regulation that has implications for exploiting their therapeutic potential.","['Kurdi, Mazen', 'Booz, George W']","['Kurdi M', 'Booz GW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2007 Aug;212(2):424-31. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21033.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, rat)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Heart Ventricles/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 1/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",['10.1002/jcp.21033 [doi]'],,"['The Division of Molecular Cardiology, The Cardiovascular Research Institute, The Texas A&M University System Health Science Center, Scott & White, Central Texas Veterans Health Care System, Temple, Texas 76504, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, it can be used to distinguish chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) from other myeloproliferative disorders (particularly myelofibrosis and polycythemia) and leukemoid reactions (LR). Traditionally, this test is performed with the use of subjective cytochemical assays that assign a score to the level of LAP. Here we present a nonsubjective, quantitative, sensitive, and inexpensive chemiluminescent technique that determines LAP based on the commercial reagent Immulite (AMPPD). To validate this methodology, intact leukocytes obtained from 32 healthy subjects, nine CML patients, and nine LR patients were submitted to the optimized protocol. By measuring the light emission elicited by four concentrations of neutrophils, we were able to estimate the activity of LAP per cell (the slope of the curve obtained by linear regression).

Antineoplastic treatment alone or with coexisting chronic viral hepatitis may permanently impair liver function. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of ALL and chronic viral hepatitis on the pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and its metabolite MEGX. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 17 children and young adults with ALL in remission. Mean remission time was 61 +/- 30 months. Eleven patients were also infected with chronic viral hepatitis type B and/or type C. The control group comprised 12 healthy children. Lidocaine and MEGX pharmacokinetics were studied after intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg lidocaine. Serum samples were obtained at 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 min. from drug administration and were processed for separation by high-performance liquid chromatography. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t-test. RESULTS: Elevated serum concentrations of MEGX 30 min. after lidocaine administration were observed in patients with ALL and hepatitis. The remaining pharmacokinetic parameters of lidocaine and MEGX did not differ significantly between groups. Our results suggest that pharmacokinetics of lidocaine and MEGX remain essentialy unaltered in ALL with coexisting chronic hepatitis.","['Mokrzycka, Malgorzata', 'Pawlik, Andrzej', 'Kaldonska, Maria', 'Millo, Barbara']","['Mokrzycka M', 'Pawlik A', 'Kaldonska M', 'Millo B']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Ann Acad Med Stetin,Annales Academiae Medicae Stetinensis,7506854,,2007/03/28 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/28 09:00'],"['2007/03/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Acad Med Stetin. 2006;52(3):61-5; discussion 65.,"['98PI200987 (Lidocaine)', 'D8Q99HC770 (monoethylglycinexylidide)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Hepatitis, Chronic/complications/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lidocaine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Liver/metabolism', '*Liver Function Tests', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/*physiopathology', 'Reference Values', 'Remission Induction']",,,"['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii Dzieciecej, Pomorskiej Akademii Medycznej, ul.

METHODS: The study was carried out in Ribeirao Preto, Southeastern Brazil in 2005. After translating FACT-BMT (version 3) into Portuguese, it was applied to 55 consecutive leukemia patients simultaneously with the Portuguese version of the Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36). These patients had undergone transplantation and were being followed up. Two clinical parameters were used for testing the sensitivity of the questionnaire: time elapsed since transplantation and presence or absence of graft-versus-host disease. Analysis of variance with the post-hoc Tukey test was used. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was applied, standardized for all the questions, final scores and domains. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 34.8+/-8.1 years and mean schooling was 10.8 +/-4.7 years, and 78.1% of the patients were female. The mean time since transplantation was 29.8+/-32.19 months. At the end of the translation and cultural adaptation process, it was seen that there had not been any alteration to the original format of the questionnaire. The internal consistency was high (0.88). The correlation between the translated questionnaire and SF-36 ranged from 0.35 to 0.57 and was considered to be moderate to good for most quality-of-life domains. The evaluation of the construct and concurrent validities was satisfactory and statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The Portuguese version of FACT-BMT was satisfactorily validated for application to Brazilian patients of both sexes undergoing bone marrow transplantation.","['Mastropietro, Ana Paula', 'Oliveira, Erika Arantes de', 'Santos, Manoel Antonio dos', 'Voltarelli, Julio Cesar']","['Mastropietro AP', 'Oliveira EA', 'Santos MA', 'Voltarelli JC']",['por'],"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Brazil,Rev Saude Publica,Revista de saude publica,0135043,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/12/21 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2006/08/09 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rev Saude Publica. 2007 Apr;41(2):260-8. doi: 10.1590/s0034-89102007000200013.,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brazil', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cultural Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Socioeconomic Factors', '*Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Translating']","['S0034-89102007000200013 [pii]', '10.1590/s0034-89102007000200013 [doi]']",,"['Hospital das Clinicas, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, SP, Brazil. anapmastro@bol.com.br']",,Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplantation: traducao e validacao.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, small-interfering RNA-mediated reduction of DUSP22 expression enhanced ERalpha-mediated transcription and endogenous gene expression. In fact, DUSP22 associated with ERalpha in vivo and both endogenous proteins interacted in ERalpha-positive breast cancer T47D cells.

The purpose of the present study was to examine and better define the role of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 in the progression of melanoma. Immunohistochemical staining for Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 was performed on paraffin sections of 100 cases of benign nevi, primary melanoma and metastatic melanoma. Expression was correlated with histopathologic features, clinical progress and expression of transcription factors (AP-2, MITF and p-Stat3). Bcl-2 was expressed in 100% of benign nevi and thin melanoma (<or=1.0 mm) but was less in thick melanoma (>1.0 mm) (88%), subcutaneous (62%) and lymph node metastases (35%). In contrast, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were expressed at lower levels in nevi and thin melanoma compared to Bcl-2 but their expression was much higher in thick melanoma and in subcutaneous and lymph node metastases (P<0.0001). Bcl-2 expression was negatively associated with tumor thickness (P<0.05) but Bcl-XL expression increased with increasing tumor thickness (P<0.05) and dermal tumor mitotic rate (P<0.05). Similarly Mcl-1 expression increased with increasing tumor thickness (P<0.09) and dermal tumor mitotic rate (P<0.17). Bcl-2 expression was positively correlated with expression of the transcription factors microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF) and nuclear AP-2 whereas Bcl-XL (and Mcl-1) expression were positively correlated with p-Stat3. This study is the first to show a clear dissociation between changes in Bcl-2 expression (downregulation) and Bcl-XL, Mcl-1 expression (upregulation) during progression of melanoma. The results were also consistent with a role for AP-2 and MITF in regulation of Bcl-2 and pStat3 in regulation of Bcl-XL.

Hemolytic and uremic syndrome (HUS) is a rare side-effect of interferon alpha and has been reported primarily in chronic myelogenous leukemia. CASE REPORT: A 44-year-old HIV-infected woman from Cameroon was admitted for treatment of cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma. Two days later, she presented severe HUS. Abdominal pains subsequently revealed non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. The patient rapidly improved after interferon withdrawal. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge this is the first case of HUS induced by interferon alpha given for Kaposi's sarcoma. Further, no cases of acute mesenteric ischemia have been reported with interferon alpha. It is possible that the condition may have been induced or aggravated by HUS or a low infusion rate. Interferon can exert vascular toxicity on both the mesenteric vessels and the renal vessels in a setting of microangiopathy.","['Zaraa, I', 'Maubec, E', 'Valeyrie-Allanore, L', 'Essig, M', 'Charachon, A', 'Chosidow, D', 'Debray, M-P', 'Marinho, E', 'Picard-Dahan, C', 'Descamps, V', 'Crickx, B']","['Zaraa I', 'Maubec E', 'Valeyrie-Allanore L', 'Essig M', 'Charachon A', 'Chosidow D', 'Debray MP', 'Marinho E', 'Picard-Dahan C', 'Descamps V', 'Crickx B']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Ann Dermatol Venereol,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,7702013,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Dermatol Venereol. 2007 Jan;134(1):65-7. doi: 10.1016/s0151-9638(07)88994-0.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*complications', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/*chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Ischemia/*chemically induced', 'Mesentery/*blood supply', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sarcoma, Kaposi/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*etiology']","['MDOI-AD-01-2007-134-1-0151-9638-101019-200520030 [pii]', '10.1016/s0151-9638(07)88994-0 [doi]']",,"['Service de Dermatologie, Hopital Bichat-Claude Bernard, Paris et Universite Denis-Diderot, Paris 7, France.']",,Syndrome hemolytique et uremique et ischemie mesenterique aigue lors d'un traitement par interferon alpha-2b pour une maladie de Kaposi associee au VIH.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding those mechanisms is still a challenging question in biology. Their modular organization allows the possibility of classifying them based on the structure of the domains that bind DNA or interact with other proteins. Those domains not only define the different TF families but also provide insights into the biological functions played by them. Among these, the POK (Poxviruses and Zinc-finger (POZ) and Kruppel) family of transcription repressors is characterized by the presence in their structures of an amino-terminal POZ/Broad Complex, Tramtrack, and Bric a brac (BTB) domain and several Kruppel-type zinc fingers at the carboxy-terminal moiety. The POZ/BTB domain mediates homo- and heterodimerization as well as protein-protein interactions, allowing the recruitment of corepressor complexes. On the other hand, the specific zinc fingers mediate specific DNA sequences recognition and binding. In the last few years, several reports have highlighted the importance that this family of transcriptional repressors plays in different processes such as cancer, development and stem cell biology.","['Costoya, Jose A']",['Costoya JA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic,Briefings in functional genomics & proteomics,101150306,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/11/02 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Brief Funct Genomic Proteomic. 2007 Mar;6(1):8-18. doi: 10.1093/bfgp/elm002.

According to our previous observations, in vitro differentiation of several erythroid cell lines is accompanied by the downregulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities. In this work we investigated whether ERKs have a decisive role in either the erythroid differentiation process or apoptosis of bcr-abl+ K562 cells by means of direct (MEK1/2 inhibitor UO126) and indirect (reduced Bcr-Abl function) inhibition of their activities. We found that both Gleevec and UO126 induced hemoglobin expression. Gleevec treatment reduced the phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl, ERK and STAT-5 for up to 24 h, decreased Bcl-XL levels, and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. In contrast, UO126 treatment resulted in only a transient decrease of ERK activity and did not induce cell death. For studying the effect of reduced Bcr-Abl function on erythroid differentiation at the level of the bcr-abl transcript, we applied the siRNA approach. Stable degradation of bcr-abl mRNA was achieved by using a retroviral vector with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter. Despite a high (>90%) transduction efficiency we detected only a transient decrease in Bcr-Abl protein and in phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels. This transient change in Bcr-Abl signaling was sufficient to induce hemoglobin expression without significant cell death. These results suggest that by transiently reducing Bcr-Abl function it is possible to overcome the differentiation blockade without evoking apoptosis in CML cells and that reduced ERK activity may have a crucial role in this process.","['Brozik, A', 'Casey, N P', 'Hegedus, Cs', 'Bors, A', 'Kozma, A', 'Andrikovics, H', 'Geiszt, M', 'Nemet, K', 'Magocsi, M']","['Brozik A', 'Casey NP', 'Hegedus C', 'Bors A', 'Kozma A', 'Andrikovics H', 'Geiszt M', 'Nemet K', 'Magocsi M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Dec;1090:344-54. doi: 10.1196/annals.1378.038.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'DNA Primers', '*Down-Regulation', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['1090/1/344 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1378.038 [doi]']",,"['National Medical Center, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, H-1113 Budapest, Dioszegi 64, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sensitivity of APL cells to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced differentiation has been successfully exploited for treatment of the disease. We previously reported that ATRA-induced NF-kappaB activation in APL cells is not essential for granulocytic differentiation, but prolongs the life span of mature cells. This prosurvival effect of NF-kappaB results from its ability to repress c-jun N terminal kinase (JNK) activation. We here report that arsenic trioxide (As2O3) can overcome the antiapoptotic effect of ATRA-induced NF-kappaB activity. As2O3 antagonizes ATRA-induced degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaB and consequently decreases NF-kappaB activation. Also, cotreatment of NB4 cells with ATRA and As2O3 results in a higher JNK activation than treatment with ATRA alone. Our results demonstrate a proapoptotic effect of As2O3 in ATRA-treated APL cells and suggest that As2O3 may be helpful in reducing incidence of side effects linked to accumulation of mature cells, like the ATRA syndrome.","['Mathieu, Julie', 'Besancon, Francoise']","['Mathieu J', 'Besancon F']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Dec;1090:203-8. doi: 10.1196/annals.1378.022.,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Probes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']","['1090/1/203 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1378.022 [doi]']",,"['INSERM U685, Centre Hayem, Hopital St. Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10, France. julie.mathieu@stlouis.inserm.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SMRT mediates the HDAC4 binding to Bach2, and HDAC4 facilitates the retention of Bach2 in the foci. Scratch transcription labelling and 3D-reconstruction from the confocal images demonstrated that transcription is suppressed in and around the Bach2 foci. Indeed, Bach2 bound MARE and repressed the expression from the chromosomally integrated MARE-driven reporter gene when co-expressed with SMRT and HDAC4.

Adhesion of JAS-RAD was inhibited by treatment with RGDS oligopeptide. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that JAS-RAD cells had high expression of CD41a and CD61 versus low CD235a expression, and JAS-REN showed low expression of CD41a, and CD61, and high CD235a.

Future studies are warranted to elucidate the role of serum FLC as biomarkers of disease, for monitoring of minimal residual disease, and as a prognostic factor for response and survival.","['Martin, William', 'Abraham, Roshini', 'Shanafelt, Tait', 'Clark, Raynell J', 'Bone, Nancy', 'Geyer, Susan M', 'Katzmann, Jerry A', 'Bradwell, Arthur', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Witzig, Thomas E']","['Martin W', 'Abraham R', 'Shanafelt T', 'Clark RJ', 'Bone N', 'Geyer SM', 'Katzmann JA', 'Bradwell A', 'Kay NE', 'Witzig TE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Transl Res,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,101280339,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2006/07/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/20 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transl Res. 2007 Apr;149(4):231-5. doi: 10.1016/j.trsl.2006.11.001.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Electrophoresis', 'Humans', 'Immunoassay/standards', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood']","['S1931-5244(06)00414-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trsl.2006.11.001 [doi]']",,"['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']","['CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While Rap1 has been discovered originally as a potential Ras antagonist, accumulating evidence indicates that Rap1 per se mediates unique signals and exerts biological functions distinctly different from Ras. Rap1 plays a dominant role in the control of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions by regulating the function of integrins and other adhesion molecules in various cell types. Rap1 also regulates MAP kinase (MAPK) activity in a manner highly dependent on the context of cell types. Recent studies (including gene-targeting analysis) have uncovered that the Rap1 signal is integrated crucially and unpredictably in the diverse aspects of comprehensive biological systems. This review summarizes the role of the Rap1 signal in developments and functions of the immune and hematopoietic systems as well as in malignancy. Importantly, Rap1 activation is tightly regulated in tissue cells, and dysregulations of the Rap1 signal in specific tissues result in certain disorders, including myeloproliferative disorders and leukemia, platelet dysfunction with defective hemostasis, leukocyte adhesion-deficiency syndrome, lupus-like systemic autoimmune disease, and T cell anergy. Many of these disorders resemble human diseases, and the Rap1 signal with its regulators may provide rational molecular targets for controlling certain human diseases including malignancy.","['Minato, Nagahiro', 'Kometani, Kohei', 'Hattori, Masakazu']","['Minato N', 'Kometani K', 'Hattori M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Adv Immunol,Advances in immunology,0370425,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Immunol. 2007;93:229-64. doi: 10.1016/S0065-2776(06)93006-5.,['EC 3.6.5.2 (rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immune System/*enzymology', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'rap1 GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism']","['S0065-2776(06)93006-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-2776(06)93006-5 [doi]']",,"['Department of Immunology and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Biostudies, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",,,,152,,,,,,,,,,,,

The myeloid lineage shows increased proliferation with effective maturation, while peripheral leukocytosis, thrombocytosis or elevated red blood cell mass are found. In Philadelphia negative CMPD recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities occur, but no specific abnormality has been defined to date. The spectrum of cytogenetic aberrations is heterogeneous ranging from numerical gains and losses to structural changes including unbalanced translocations. The most common chromosomal abnormalities are 20q-, 13q-, 12p-, +8, +9, partial duplication of 1q, balanced translocations involving 8p11 and gains in 9p. Cytogenetic analysis of CMPD by conventional or molecular techniques has an important role in establishing the diagnosis of a malignant disease, adding also more information for disease outcome. Molecular studies may detect the possible role of candidate genes implicated in the neoplastic process, addressing new molecular target therapies. FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha rearrangements, as well as alterations of PDGFRbeta or FGFR1 gene have been found to be associated with specific types of CMPD. Recently, a novel somatic mutation, JAK2V617F, has been reported in most of the polycthemia vera (PV) patients, as well as in a lower percentage in essential thrombocythemia (ET) or idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) patients.

In this study, we are interested in the effect of the drug on the cellular DNA integrity. Amoxicillin was added to the human or hamster cells in culture, and the DNA lesions induced by the drug were assessed by a comet assay with nuclear extract incubation (Wang et al., 2005 Anal Biochem 337: 70-75). Amoxicillin at 5mM rapidly induced DNA lesions in human AGS cells. The level of DNA lesions attained a maximum at about 1h, and then declined steadily and reached almost the basal level at 6h following the drug treatment. Similar induction pattern of DNA lesions was found with amoxicillin-related antibiotics such as ampicillin but not with the unrelated antibiotics such as kanamycin. For studying the repair kinetics, the cells were treated with amoxicillin for only 1h and continued culture in the absence of the drug for a certain period of time before subsequent analysis. Repair of the amoxicillin-induced DNA lesions was essentially completed within 4h. Such repair may not involve nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway because the repair was completed with similar kinetics in both NER proficient Chinese hamster CHO-K1 cells and its isogenic NER deficient UV24 cells. Instead, the repair may involve base excision repair (BER) pathway because immunodepletion of OGG1/2, glycosylases involved in BER rendered the nuclear extract unable to excise DNA lesions induced by amoxicillin in the modified comet assay. Furthermore, amoxicillin induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) at the tempo similar to that of DNA lesions induction. Thus, we hypothesize that amoxicillin causes oxidative DNA damage in mammalian cells via ROS.","['Li, Pei-Yi', 'Chang, Yu-Ching', 'Tzang, Bor-Show', 'Chen, Chung-Chu', 'Liu, Yin-Chang']","['Li PY', 'Chang YC', 'Tzang BS', 'Chen CC', 'Liu YC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2006/11/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/02 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 May 18;629(2):133-9. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2007.02.005.

Bisulfite sequencing analysis of the CpG sites of the PRAME exon 2 in these cancer cell lines revealed a close relationship between the methylation status of the PRAME gene and its expression. A methylation-specific PCR analysis demonstrated that hypomethylation of PRAME was significantly more frequent in CML blast crisis (70%) than in chronic phase (36%) (P=0.01) and was correlated with high expression levels of PRAME transcripts (P<0.0001).

Besides, our results show that lactogenic hormones increase LIF effect on gene induction without modifying STAT3 phosphorylation state. Our findings strongly suggest that there is crosstalk between STAT5 and STAT3 pathways that could modulate their ability to regulate gene expression.","['Granillo, Agustina Rodriguez', 'Boffi, Juan Carlos', 'Baranao, Lino', 'Kordon, Edith', 'Pecci, Adali', 'Guberman, Alejandra']","['Granillo AR', 'Boffi JC', 'Baranao L', 'Kordon E', 'Pecci A', 'Guberman A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 May 11;356(3):727-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.03.040.

This has allowed identification of high-risk patients who may benefit from more aggressive therapies, including hematopoietic cell transplantation. High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation is feasible, and results in encouraging responses, including molecular responses, with low transplant-associated mortality. However, it has failed to show a plateau effect on survival curves. On the other hand, there is convincing evidence that immunologically mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect of donor T cells are responsible for lowering the incidence of relapse and allowing possible ""cure"" in allograft recipients, albeit at the expense of high treatment-associated mortality using conventional myeloablation. Reducing the intensity of conditioning regimens has translated into lesser toxicity with reasonable preservation of its curative potential. Autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia remain promising and evolving treatment options. Treatment of CLL should consider stratification according to modern prognostic markers.","['Kharfan-Dabaja, Mohamed A', 'Anasetti, Claudio', 'Santos, Edgardo S']","['Kharfan-Dabaja MA', 'Anasetti C', 'Santos ES']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2006/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Apr;13(4):373-85. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.01.075.,['0 (Autoantigens)'],IM,,"['Autoantigens', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']","['S1083-8791(07)00114-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2007.01.075 [doi]']",,"['Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology, H.

STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study. Attained adult height was determined among 2434 ALL survivors participating in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of common pediatric cancers diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with 3009 siblings. RESULTS: All survivor treatment exposure groups (chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy with cranial or craniospinal radiotherapy) had decreased adult height and an increased risk of adult short stature (height standard deviation score < -2) compared with siblings (P < .001). Compared with siblings, the risk of short stature for survivors treated with chemotherapy alone was elevated (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.9, 6.0). Among survivors, significant risk factors for short stature included diagnosis of ALL before puberty, higher-dose cranial radiotherapy (> or = 20 Gy versus < 20 Gy), any radiotherapy to the spine, and female sex. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood ALL are at increased risk of adult short stature, including those treated with chemotherapy alone. Risk is highest for those treated with cranial and craniospinal radiotherapy at a young age.","['Chow, Eric J', 'Friedman, Debra L', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Whitton, John A', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Sklar, Charles A']","['Chow EJ', 'Friedman DL', 'Yasui Y', 'Whitton JA', 'Stovall M', 'Robison LL', 'Sklar CA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,PMC2766352,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/04/12 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2006/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2006/08/19 00:00 [revised]', '2006/11/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"J Pediatr. 2007 Apr;150(4):370-5, 375.e1. doi: 10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.11.036.",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Age of Onset', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Body Height', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy/statistics & numerical data', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Puberty', 'Radiotherapy/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Siblings', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']","['S0022-3476(06)01111-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpeds.2006.11.036 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA. ericchow@u.washington.edu']","['U24 CA055727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009351/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24-CA55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009351-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA055727-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['J Pediatr. 2007 Apr;150(4):332-4.

The expectation was that the vast majority of these patients would exhibit a complete cytogenetic response on imatinib alone. Studies of patients with acquired imatinib resistance revealed that Bcr-Abl signaling is reactivated at the time of resistance, predominantly because of mutations that interfere with drug binding in the kinase domain of Bcr-Abl. The knowledge that Bcr-Abl remains the optimal target for treating imatinib-refractory CML has driven an already highly successful search for alternative approaches to restore target inhibition. Here, we review the current state of affairs in the realm of controlling drug resistance in CML, including cutting-edge strategies to reign in Bcr-AblT315I, which is cross resistant to imatinib, as well as the ""next generation"" Bcr-Abl inhibitors, nilotinib and dasatinib.

Although diverse mechanisms seem to be involved, the principal cause appears to be the emergence of point mutations in the Abl kinase domain that affect drug affinity and some of which impair the efficacy with which the drugs bind. Currently, > 50 different mutations have been identified, and the extent to which they confer resistance varies considerably. One of the more common mutations results from the substitution of isoleucine for threonine at Abl amino acid position 351, known as the T315I mutation. It appears that the precise position of the substitution within the kinase domain dictates the degree of resistance to TKIs, and patients with the T315I mutation develop almost complete resistance to imatinib, dasatinib, and nilotinib.

However, achieving this goal requires the identification of agents that will eradicate the leukemic stem cell population. Several potent Bcr-Abl-targeted drugs have now been introduced into clinical practice with remarkable effects. Nevertheless, accumulating data indicate that the leukemic CML stem cells in patients with chronic phase CML are less responsive to these agents than the bulk of the neoplastic cells. In this article, we review emerging evidence that CML stem cells have a number of unusual properties that underlie their relative insensitivity to treatment, including those that specifically target the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein. The biology of the neoplastic stem cells in patients with CML is clearly important to the future attainment of cures and might also prove a paradigm relevant to other types of malignancies that are sustained by transformed stem cell populations.","['Jiang, Xiaoyan', 'Smith, Clayton', 'Eaves, Allen', 'Eaves, Connie']","['Jiang X', 'Smith C', 'Eaves A', 'Eaves C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma,Clinical lymphoma & myeloma,101256500,,2007/03/27 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/03/27 09:00'],"['2007/03/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lymphoma Myeloma. 2007 Mar;7 Suppl 2:S71-80. doi: 10.3816/clm.2007.s.005.,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/analysis', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']","['S1557-9190(11)70119-6 [pii]', '10.3816/clm.2007.s.005 [doi]']",,"['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,131,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our objective was to employ a panel of cytochemical and immunohistochemical markers to determine which ones would be most useful in separating these two entities. METHODS: We stained 17 cases of cutaneous mast cell disease and 20 cases of myeloid leukemia cutis with Giemsa, toluidine blue, or pinacyanol erythrosinate (PE), as well as with antibodies against mast cell tryptase, microphthalmia transcription factor (MiTF), CD117 (c-kit), myeloperoxidase, CD43, CD25, CD2, and CD68. RESULTS: Mast cell tryptase and MiTF emerged as highly sensitive and specific markers for mast cell disease in this context, as both antibodies stained all cases of mast cell diseases but none of myeloid leukemia cutis. Although CD117 stained all cases of mast cell disease, it also stained 2 of 18 cases of myeloid leukemia cutis. PE appeared to be specific for mast cell disease, as 11 of 12 cases stained with this marker, compared with 0 of 18 cases of myeloid leukemia cutis.

METHODS: The recombinant adenovirus Ad-GFP/SCL was constructed by Ad-Easy system based on the homologous recombination in bacteria, then 1.6 x 10(9) PFU of recombinant adenoviruses were injected into Balb/c mice with ICC loss via the tail vein. In vivo distribution and efficiency of recombinant adenoviruses mediated hSCL were observed by GFP under the fluorescent microscope at different phases. The expression of SCL gene was measured by RT-PCR method. The damages were observed in different organs by HE staining. RESULTS: The recombinant adenovirus containing hSCL was quickly constructed by homologous recombination in bacteria using Ad-Easy system. Under the fluorescent microscope, GFP was revealed in heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, small intestine and large intestine of mice with ICC loss at different phases. No obvious damages were observed in various visceral organs by HE staining. RT-PCR showed SCL mRNA expression in various visceral organs at different levels. CONCLUSIONS: Construction of adenovirus vector by the homologous recombination in bacteria is an efficient and time saving method, and a high titer of adenovirus is able to mediate the safe and stable expression of SCL gene in mice with ICC loss.

Consequently, asparaginase is a major component of ALL therapy, but the mechanisms regulating the susceptibility of leukemic cells to this agent are unclear. In 288 children with ALL, cellular ASNS expression was more likely to be high in T-lineage ALL and low in B-lineage ALL with TEL-AML1 or hyperdiploidy. However, ASNS expression levels in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (MSCs), which form the microenvironment where leukemic cells grow, were on average 20 times higher than those in ALL cells. MSCs protected ALL cells from asparaginase cytotoxicity in coculture experiments. This protective effect correlated with levels of ASNS expression: downregulation by RNA interference decreased the capacity of MSCs to protect ALL cells from asparaginase, whereas enforced ASNS expression conferred enhanced protection. Asparagine secretion by MSCs was directly related to their ASNS expression levels, suggesting a mechanism - increased concentrations of asparagine in the leukemic cell microenvironment - for the protective effects we observed. These results provide what we believe to be a new basis for understanding asparaginase resistance in ALL and indicate that MSC niches in the bone marrow can form a safe haven for leukemic cells.","['Iwamoto, Shotaro', 'Mihara, Keichiro', 'Downing, James R', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Campana, Dario']","['Iwamoto S', 'Mihara K', 'Downing JR', 'Pui CH', 'Campana D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,PMC1821067,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/09/04 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2007 Apr;117(4):1049-57. doi: 10.1172/JCI30235.

As such, this molecule is a promising target for antibody therapy. After early disappointments, improved anti-CD38 antibodies of strong cytolytic potential have been described by 3 groups. First, a human IgG monoclonal anti-CD38 antibody raised in mice transgenic for human Ig has been found to induce potent complement and cellular cytotoxicities against both myeloma cell lines and fresh harvests from myeloma marrow and leukemic blood. This antibody also exhibits the singular property of inhibiting the CD38 cyclase activity. Second, a series of CD38-specific human antibodies, with high affinities and high ADCC activities against cell lines and primary cultures of myeloma, has been selected from a unique phage-display library. Finally, to enhance specificity for myeloma cells, bispecific domain antibodies targeting both CD38 and CD138 have been developed. As they lack any Fc module, these constructs rely on cytotoxicity for delivering a toxin to tumor cells. The list of candidate CD38-bearing neoplasms as targets for these antibody constructs can now be expanded to include acute promyelocytic leukemia, and possibly other myeloid leukemias, in which surface CD38 can be induced by retinoid treatment.

CD38(high) B-CLL cases show activated phenotypic features as compared with CD38(low) cases. Moreover, a greater percentage of Ki-67 and telomerase activity is documented among CD38(high) cases. Also, CD38 is not merely a negative prognostic marker in B-CLL, but also a key element in the pathogenetic network underlying the disease. A large series of B-CLL cases investigating the CD38 expression on bone marrow B-cells identified CD38 value <10% as the cut-off predicting a longer time to treatment. However, neither CD38 nor ZAP-70 by themselves or in combination were able to anticipate IgVH mutational status. Transferring these findings into clinical ground, 3 groups of B-CLL cases were identified with significantly different clinical courses: i.e., low-risk (no negative prognostic factor), intermediate-risk (1 negative prognostic factor) and high-risk (2-3 negative prognostic factors) patients. Altogether these results suggest that: i) CD38-expressing cells present not only an activation status, but also a different stage differentiation with a more repeated turnover; ii) CD38 contributes to controlling a signaling pathway that confers to B-CLL cells an increased proliferative potential, enhancing aggressiveness of this variant; iii) different CD38 cut off values should be considered for peripheral blood and bone marrow; iv) CD38 seems to independently contribute to prognostic stratification of B-CLL.","['Morabito, Fortunato', 'Damle, Rajendra N', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Keating, Michael', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Morabito F', 'Damle RN', 'Deaglio S', 'Keating M', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,PMC1829202,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2006 Nov-Dec;12(11-12):342-4. doi: 10.2119/2006-00110.Morabito.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",['10.2119/2006-00110.Morabito [doi]'],,"['Unita Operativa di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy. fortunato_morabito@tin.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, less information is available about the L chain V gene segments utilized by B-CLL cells and to what extent their characteristics resemble those of the H chain. We analyzed the V(L) and J(L) gene segments of 206 B-CLL patients, paying particular attention to frequency of use and association, mutation status, and LCDR3 characteristics. Approximately 40% of B-CLL cases express V(L) genes that differ significantly from their germline counterparts. Certain genes were virtually always mutated and others virtually never. In addition, preferential pairing of specific V(L) and J(L) segments was found. These findings are reminiscent of the expressed VH repertoire in B-CLL. However unlike the V(H) repertoire, V(L) gene use was not significantly different than that of normal B-lymphocytes. In addition, Vkappa genes that lie more upstream on the germline locus were less frequently mutated than those at the 3' end of the locus; this was not the case for Vlambda genes and is not for V(H) genes. These similarities and differences between the IgH and IgL V gene repertoires expressed in B-CLL suggest some novel features while also reinforcing concepts derived from studies of the IgH repertoire.","['Ghiotto, Fabio', 'Fais, Franco', 'Albesiano, Emilia', 'Sison, Cristina', 'Valetto, Angelo', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Reinhardt, Janine', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Ferrarini, Manlio', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['Ghiotto F', 'Fais F', 'Albesiano E', 'Sison C', 'Valetto A', 'Gaidano G', 'Reinhardt J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Rai K', 'Allen SL', 'Ferrarini M', 'Chiorazzi N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,PMC1829199,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2006 Nov-Dec;12(11-12):300-8. doi: 10.2119/2006-00080.Ghiotto.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD/blood/immunology', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin M/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Multigene Family', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Reference Values']",['10.2119/2006-00080.Ghiotto [doi]'],,"['Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital, Manhasset, NY, USA. fghiotto@unige.it']","['R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081554/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that sequence-specific gene silencing could be induced by long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in mouse embryos, mouse oocytes, embryonic stem cells, and other mammalian cells. Based on these findings, a dsRNA-expressing RNAi vector system was designed. This study provided evidence that the vector design could induce efficient knockdown of expression of both exogenous egfp gene and endogenous MTM1 gene in mouse embryonic stem cells. A random RNAi library was established by cloning enzyme-digested cDNA of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into the BamHI site of the convergent dual promoter RNAi vector. Sequencing of 20 randomly selected clones from the library showed that 17 contained inserts and that all of them were unique sequences. A functional genetic screen of genes involving in self-renewal and differentiation with the random RNAi library identified ubiquitin. The ubiquitin knockdown ES cell line generated 20%-30% of undifferentiated colonies in the absence of leukemia inhibitor factor, whereas parental ES cells and control vector pDCont transfectants produced less than 5% of colonies of undifferentiated cells, suggesting that ubiquitin plays a role in ES cell differentiation. The random RNAi library provides a useful tool for investigation of molecular mechanisms of cellular development and differentiation.","['Jian, Rui', 'Cheng, Xiaoxing', 'Jiang, Jing', 'Deng, Shaoli', 'Hu, Fuquan', 'Zhang, Junlei']","['Jian R', 'Cheng X', 'Jiang J', 'Deng S', 'Hu F', 'Zhang J']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/09/27 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells. 2007 Aug;25(8):1904-12. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.2006-0448.

We use domain knowledge, e.g. the Gene Ontology, to guide analysis of such data. By focusing on domain-aggregated results at, say the molecular function level, increased interpretability is available to biological scientists beyond what is possible if results are presented at the gene level. RESULTS: We use a 'top-down' approach to perform domain aggregation by first combining gene expressions before testing for differentially expressed patterns. This is in contrast to the more standard 'bottom-up' approach, where genes are first tested individually then aggregated by domain knowledge. The benefits are greater sensitivity for detecting signals. Our method, domain-enhanced analysis (DEA) is assessed and compared to other methods using simulation studies and analysis of two publicly available leukemia data sets.

Prognosis is poor for the majority of AML patients, based on age and/or adverse biologic features. Standard therapy for AML is highly toxic and poorly tolerated, particularly by the group of older patients for whom few useful therapies exist. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is an important option for patients with high-risk AML during first remission, as well as for any patient in second or subsequent remission. Use of reduced intensity conditioning transplantations has made allogeneic stem cell transplantation available for a wider group of individuals, but the impact of this novel procedure on the natural history of AML is unknown. The major thrust of novel therapeutics in AML is development of so-called targeted therapies, which are based on exploitation of newly understood pathophysiological events critical for leukemogenesis. Such events include unbridled proliferation, failure to differentiate, stromal cell-mediated survival factors, and failure to undergo normal programmed cell death. Therapies developed to deal with these problems include inhibitors of ras physiology and activated tyrosine kinases, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase 3; histone deacetylase inhibitors, and DNA-hypomethylating agents, which promote transcription of silenced genes; angiogenesis inhibitors; and anti-bcl-2 agents, respectively. Challenges in therapeutic development include the likelihood that only a subset of AML patients will respond to any of these therapies, based on the patient's intrinsic pathophysiology as well as the fact that many of these agents will only work in conjunction with chemotherapy or other viable antileukemic therapies.","['Stone, Richard M']",['Stone RM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Apr;35(4 Suppl 1):163-6. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.025.,['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)'],IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/enzymology/physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']","['S0301-472X(07)00028-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.025 [doi]']",,"['Harvard Medical School and Leukemia Program, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. rstone@partners.org']",,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the majority of patients are diagnosed with low-grade disease, approximately two-thirds will succumb to complications of peripheral blood cytopenias or progression to acute leukemia. In recent years, there has been striking progress in our understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders. For example, the recognition of the roles of angiogenesis and cytokine abnormalities in the development of these diseases led to clinical trials with agents such as thalidomide, which yielded encouraging erythroid responses. Subsequent work with the thalidomide derivative lenalidomide resulted in marked erythroid and cytogenetic responses in individuals with the 5q- abnormality. Additionally, the identification of hypermethylation as an important aspect in the pathogenesis of these and other hematological diseases led to clinical trials utilizing the demethylating agents azacitidine and decitibine. These agents are now known to result in trilineage responses in 30% to 50% of patients with MDS with as many as 20% achieving partial or complete remissions. These results have altered the natural history of these diseases in a significant number of patients. Investigators anticipate that further studies with tyrosine kinase, histone deacetylase, and farnesyl transferase inhibitors will contribute to already promising attempts to reverse or block the pathogenesis of these diseases. Other novel agents are being evaluated as investigators continue to make progress for patients affected by these disorders.","['Shadduck, Richard K', 'Latsko, Joan M', 'Rossetti, James M', 'Haq, Bushra', 'Abdulhaq, Haifaa']","['Shadduck RK', 'Latsko JM', 'Rossetti JM', 'Haq B', 'Abdulhaq H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Apr;35(4 Suppl 1):137-43. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.022.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/physiopathology']","['S0301-472X(07)00025-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.022 [doi]']",,"['Western Pennsylvania Cancer Institute, Western Pennsylvania Hospital, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA. rshadduck@msn.com']",,,,38,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice, C3H/He, and C57BL/6 strain, male and female, with or without genetic modifications, e.g., p53-deficiency or thioredoxin overexpression were used in the present hemopoietic stem/progenitor research, radiation- or benzene-induced leukemogenesis followed by histopathological examination. A lethal dose of radiation for bone marrow transplantation, and a graded increased dose up to 5 Gy of x-rays for induction of hematopoietic malignancies were given. For caloric restriction studies, 77 kcal/week was maintained in accordance to different restriction-timing. For assays of hematopoietic colonization, colony-forming unit spleen and colony-forming unit granulocyte macrophage were evaluated. Hematopoietic progenitor cell-specific kinetics were studied by continuous labeling of bromodeoxyuridine for cycling cells, followed by ultraviolet (UV) exposure and hemopoietic colonization (bromodeoxyuridine UV [BUUV] method). Various experimental survival curves were applied to a mathematical analysis by Gompertz-Makeham law of mortality. RESULTS: Referring current authors' studies on leukemogenesis induced by ionizing radiation and benzene exposure, implications of hematopoietic progenitor cell kinetics to the experimental leukemogenesis were evaluated by means of a novel experimental tool, the BUUV method. Comparative studies to elucidate relevancies of these data, including two prevention studies, one on caloric restriction and the other on antioxidative thioredoxin overexpression, to those Gompertzean survival curves of experimental animals were analyzed.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used two-dimensional electrophoresis gel in combination with mass spectrometry (MS), i.e., matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time-of-flight MS and electrospray ionization-liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, to identify protein signatures in blood-plasma samples collected from control and rAML mice. There were nine cases of rAML (three cases induced by high LET radiation; six induced by low LET radiation) and eight control mice at similar ages. RESULTS: The results showed differences in the patterns of protein profiles from blood-plasma samples collected from rAML vs control mice. Moreover, our data demonstrated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, differences between the plasma protein profiles obtained from mice with AML induced by low vs high LET radiation. Most of the proteins that were present at greater levels in normal samples than in rAML samples were associated with normal metabolism and growth. Several acute-phase proteins were upregulated in rAML samples. CONCLUSION: The data present, for the first time, evidence for increased expression of clusterin and a loss of gelsolin expression in blood plasma as potential biomarkers of rAML in the CBA/CaJ mouse. Results also indicate that two-dimensional electrophoresis, in combination with MS, is a highly sensitive technique for identification of blood-based biomarkers of rAML.","['Rithidech, Kanokporn Noy', 'Honikel, Louise', 'Simon, Sanford R']","['Rithidech KN', 'Honikel L', 'Simon SR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Apr;35(4 Suppl 1):117-24. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.019.,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)']",IM,,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/analysis', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Gamma Rays', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*blood', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Neutrons/adverse effects', 'Proteome/*analysis', 'X-Rays']","['S0301-472X(07)00022-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.019 [doi]']",,"['Pathology Department, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8691, USA. krithidech@notes.cc.sunysb.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Constitutive activation of Flt3 (Flt3-ITD) has been reported in 25 to 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Retroviral vectors expressing constitutively activated Flt3 and STAT5A were used to transduce human cord blood CD34(+) cells and HSC cell self-renewal and differentiation were evaluated. RESULTS: We have demonstrated that retroviral transduction of Flt3 mutations into CD34(+) cells enhanced HSC self-renewal as measured in vitro in competitive stromal coculture and limiting-dilution week-2 cobblestone (CAFC) assays. Enhanced erythropoiesis and decreased myelopoiesis were noted together with strong activation of STAT5A. Consequently, transduction studies were undertaken with a constitutively active mutant of STAT5A (STAT5A[1( *)6]) and here also a marked, selective expansion of transduced CD34(+) cells was noted, with a massive increase in self-renewing CAFC detectable at both 2 and 5 weeks of stromal coculture. Differentiation was biased to erythropoiesis, including erythropoietin independence, with myeloid maturation inhibition. The observed phenotypic changes correlated with differential gene expression, with a number of genes differentially regulated by both the Flt3 and STAT5A mutants. These included upregulation of genes involved in erythropoiesis and downregulation of genes involved in myelopoiesis. The phenotype of week-2 self-renewing CAFC also characterized primary Flt3-ITD(+) AML bone marrow samples. Isolation of leukemic stem cells (LSC) with a CD34(+), CD38(-), HLA-DR(-) phenotype was undertaken with Flt3-ITD(+) AML samples resulting in co-purification of early CAFC. Gene expression of LSC relative to the bulk leukemic population revealed upregulation of homeobox genes (HOXA9, HOXA5) implicated in leukemogenesis, and hepatic leukemia factor (HLF) involved in stem cell proliferation. CONCLUSION: Myeloid leukemogenesis is a multi-stage process that can involve constitutively activated receptors and downstream pathways involving STAT5, HOX genes, and HLF.","['Moore, Malcolm A S', 'Dorn, David C', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob', 'Chung, Ki Young', 'Morrone, Giovanni']","['Moore MA', 'Dorn DC', 'Schuringa JJ', 'Chung KY', 'Morrone G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/05/15 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Apr;35(4 Suppl 1):105-16. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.018.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HOXA5 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT5A protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Antigens, CD34', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mutation', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*immunology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*metabolism']","['S0301-472X(07)00021-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.018 [doi]']",,"['Moore Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. m-moore@ski.mskcc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to identify and characterize retinoic acid (RA) target genes. METHODS AND RESULTS: RTP801 is a recently cloned stress response gene that acts as a negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Here we identified RTP801 as a novel early RA target gene in myeloid cells. RTP801 mRNA levels are induced in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines during RA-dependent differentiation and are differentially expressed during maturation of normal CD34(+) cells. The myeloid-specific, differentiation-related transcription factor C/EBPepsilon also induces RTP801 expression. Overexpression of RTP801 in the U937 leukemic cells leads to growth inhibition and apoptosis. Conversely, silencing of endogenous RTP801 by shRNA reduces RA-induced differentiation of the U937 cells. Downregulation of RTP801 also abrogates hypoxia-induced inhibition of mTOR in those cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that RTP801 is an important RA-regulated gene involved in myeloid differentiation, which could represent a therapeutic target in leukemia.","['Gery, Sigal', 'Park, Dorothy J', 'Vuong, Peter T', 'Virk, Renu K', 'Muller, Claudia I', 'Hofmann, Wolf-K', 'Koeffler, H Phillip']","['Gery S', 'Park DJ', 'Vuong PT', 'Virk RK', 'Muller CI', 'Hofmann WK', 'Koeffler HP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,PMC1922386,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/20 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2007 Apr;35(4):572-8. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.049.,"['0 (DDIT4 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Division', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'U937 Cells']","['S0301-472X(07)00061-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2007.01.049 [doi]']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, 8700 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA. gerys@cshs.org']",['R01 CA026038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['NIHMS20594'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data from 673 subjects (540 receiving tipifarnib and 133 receiving placebo) were included in the analysis. Tipifarnib was administered in doses ranging from 100 mg to 850 mg twice daily under fed conditions for 21 days in a 28 day cycle. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to evaluate the relationships between tipifarnib exposure and haematological (neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and nonhaematological toxicities. Tipifarnib exposure was quantified as the area under the curve during the first cycle of chemotherapy (AUC), the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), the time above plasma tipifarnib concentrations of 400 (T400) and 600 ng ml(-1) (T600), the cumulative area under the curve (AUC(T)), and the area under the curve density (AUC(D)), defined as the ratio AUC(T) to the duration of treatment. The nonhaematological toxicities measured were elevation of AST, ALT, bilirubin and serum creatinine, the occurrence of a skin rash, CNS or peripheral neuropathy, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Odds ratios (OR) associated with drug exposure were used to measure the effect of the drug. RESULTS: Tipifarnib AUC exhibited a positive and significant association with neutropenia grade > or =3 (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47, 1.95) and thrombocytopenia grade > or =3 (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21, 1.63) in patients with solid tumours, but not in refractory or relapsed AML patients. The incidence of exposure-related nonhaematological toxicity is small regardless of tumour type. No association was found between tipifarnib AUC and the elevation of AST, ALT and total bilirubin, and nausea and vomiting. There was a weak relationship between tipifarnib AUC and serum creatinine elevation (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.11, 1.26), CNS (OR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01, 1.10) and peripheral neurotoxicity (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.03, 1.18), diarrhoea (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.08, 1.21), gastrointestinal tract inflammation (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.07, 1.19), and skin rash (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.04, 1.17).

Animal studies, as well as cases from a human clinical trial, have proven the potential of insertional leukemogenesis caused by a retroviral vector. Here, we report the observation of six T-lymphoblastic leukemia cases arising during the course of a gene therapy study for hemophilia B after transplantation of ex vivo transduced hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) by a lentivirus vector. Three of these animals comprised secondary recipients of the same donor and LAM-PCR was performed to identify the vector integration loci. We located integrations in repeat elements of known genes, including a candidate brain-tumor locus, but none of these clones could be tracked in the leukemic blasts. Although transduced clones with an intact proviral cassette were detected in the spleen of the leukemic animals, they comprised a very small proportion, not correlating to the levels of leukemic blasts. After propagation of the latter in NOD/SCID mice, we could no longer detect the proviral cassette suggesting that the leukemic blasts were untransduced.

The 1st case was initially misdiagnosed as Ewing sarcoma due to a lack of CD45 expression and weak expression of CD99.

Initially, clonal T cell malignancies, including T cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia (T-LGL), mucosis fungoides and peripheral T cell lymphoma were targets for the TCR-based analytic assays such as detection of clonality by T-gamma rearrangement using y-chain-specific PCR or Southern Blotting. Study of these disorders facilitated further analytic concepts and application of rational methods of TCR analysis to investigations of polyclonal T cell-mediated diseases. In hematology, such conditions include graft versus host disease (GvHD) and immune-mediated bone marrow failure syndromes. In aplastic anemia (AA), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), cytotoxic T cell responses may be directed against certain antigens located on stem or more lineage-restricted progenitor cells in single lineage cytopenias. The nature of the antigenic targets driving polyclonal CTL responses remains unclear. Novel methods of TCR repertoire analysis, include VB flow cytometry, peptide-specific tetramer staining, in vitro stimulation assays and TCR CDR3-specific PCR. Such PCR assay can be either VB family-specific or multiplexed for all VB families. Amplified products can be characterized and quantitated to facilitate detection of the most immunodominant clonotypes. Such clonotypes may serve as markers for the global polyclonal T cell response. Identification of these clonotypes can be performed in blood and tissue biopsy material by various methods. Once immunodominant clonotypes corresponding to pathogenic CTL clones are identified they can serve as surrogate markers for the activity of the pathophysiologic process or even indicate the presence of specific antigens. The relevance of the individual clonotypes can be ascertained from clinical correlations with the activity of the disease. Quantitative clonotypic assays such as sequencing of multiple CDR3 clones or clonotypic Taqman PCR can be applied for the monitoring of the immunosuppressive therapy and prediction of relapse. Future technologies may allow for the design of clonotypic microarrays or other more clinically applicable methods of clonotypic diagnostics. Similarly, identification of immunodominant clonotypes may facilitate targeting of autoimmune or malignant clones with vaccination and induction of anti-idiotypic responses.","['Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', ""O'Keefe, Christine"", 'Gondek, Lukasz', 'Tiu, Ramon']","['Maciejewski JP', ""O'Keefe C"", 'Gondek L', 'Tiu R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,,2007/03/24 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/03/24 09:00'],"['2007/03/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2007;45(1):5-14.,,IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",,,"['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Center, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. maciejj@cc.ccf.org']",,,,57,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of RIC on the incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) has not been evaluated systematically. Factors confounding such analyses include short follow-up in studies, absence of prospective comparison trials, use of a variety of RIC regimens, lack of uniform GVHD prophylaxis and lack of rigorous criteria for the diagnosis and staging of chronic GVHD. This review discusses factors that appear to influence the incidence and clinical presentation of chronic GVHD in the RIC transplantation era. Overall, RIC seems to decrease the incidence and severity of acute GVHD through day 100 post-transplant when compared to conventional conditioning; however, there is little evidence to suggest that chronic GVHD is reduced after RIC. For the more definitive assessments of chronic GVHD after RIC it will be important to study this question in prospective comparison trials with long duration of follow-up.

We generated 'knock-in' mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells that express a NHD13 fusion gene from the endogenous murine NUP98 promoter, and used an in vitro differentiation system to differentiate the ES cells to hematopoietic colonies. Replating assays demonstrated that the partially differentiated NHD13 ES cells were immortal, and two of these cultures were transferred to liquid culture. These cell lines are partially differentiated immature hematopoietic cells, as determined by morphology, immunophenotype and gene expression profile. Despite these characteristics, they were unable to differentiate when exposed to high concentrations of erythropoietin (Epo), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor or macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The cell lines are incompletely transformed, as evidenced by their dependence on interleukin 3 (IL-3), and their failure to initiate tumors when injected into immunodeficient mice. We attempted genetic complementation of the NHD13 gene using IL-3 independence and tumorigenicity in immunodeficient mice as markers of transformation, and found that BCR-ABL successfully transformed the cell lines. These findings support the hypothesis that expression of a NHD13 fusion gene impairs hematopoietic differentiation, and that these cell lines present a model system to study the nature of this impaired differentiation.","['Slape, C', 'Chung, Y J', 'Soloway, P D', 'Tessarollo, L', 'Aplan, P D']","['Slape C', 'Chung YJ', 'Soloway PD', 'Tessarollo L', 'Aplan PD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2063470,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1239-48. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404648.

Patients received double induction therapy, either 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, and daunorubicin (TAD9)/high-dose cytosine arabinoside plus mitoxantrone (HAM) or HAM/HAM, followed by consolidation therapy (TAD9) according to the AML-Cooperative group 92 trial (AMLCG92) and AML-Cooperative group 99 trial (AMLCG99). All cases underwent cytomorphological, cytogenetical and molecular genetic analyses. AML1-ETO transcript levels were quantitatively assessed at diagnosis and during follow-up by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The median reduction of initial AML1-ETO expression level was 4 log (range 0-5) after both induction and consolidation therapies. The quality of molecular response after induction as well as consolidation therapies had significant impact on the cumulative incidence of relapse (P=0.021 and P=0.001, respectively), event free survival (EFS: P=0.001 and P=0.001, respectively) and overall survival (OS: P=0.013 and P=0.014, respectively). HAM/HAM improved the molecular response to induction therapy (P=0.042) but after consolidation, no differences in molecular response were detectable between TAD9/HAM and HAM/HAM. Patient- or disease-related factors had no impact on the molecular response to induction or consolidation therapy. The current study demonstrates that quantification of AML1-ETO transcript levels is a powerful tool for prediction of prognosis that is independent of pretreatment risk factors, and may be helpful for directing therapeutic decisions in the future.","['Weisser, M', 'Haferlach, C', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Schnittger, S']","['Weisser M', 'Haferlach C', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schnittger S']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Jun;21(6):1177-82. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404659.

However, it remains unclear whether the effects of such Smac agonists are dependent on apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), a key component of the apoptosome. Here, we explored the role of Apaf-1 through overexpression of this protein in the B-lymphoma cell line Raji that is defective for cytosolic Apaf-1 expression. Enforced expression of Apaf-1 rendered Raji cells sensitive to staurosporine as well as to the proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin. Importantly, co-treatment with Smac peptides resulted in a threefold higher degree of apoptosis in Apaf-1-expressing Raji cells, but not in mock-transfected cells. Smac peptides also potentiated apoptosis of the DG-75 cell line following liberation of endogenous Apaf-1 from the plasma membrane, but were ineffective when added alone. Furthermore, we observed high levels of expression in several B-lymphoma cell lines of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-2 (cIAP2), and immunodepletion of cIAP2 (a target of Smac) was found to sensitize Apaf-1-overexpressing Raji cells to cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of Apaf-1 in Smac-mediated potentiation of apoptosis of B-lymphoma-derived cells.","['Sun, Y', 'Ottosson, A', 'Pervaiz, S', 'Fadeel, B']","['Sun Y', 'Ottosson A', 'Pervaiz S', 'Fadeel B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):1035-43. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404660.

We analyzed the data of 398 myeloma patients after induction with Thal, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (TAD) in comparison with vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone (VAD) followed by mobilization with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, dexamethasone (CAD) and PBSC collection. Within both the study groups, patients treated with TAD showed to collect significantly fewer CD34(+) cells compared with VAD (GMMG, TAD: median 9.8 x 10(6)/kg; range 2.0-33.6; VAD: median 10.9 x 10(6)/kg range 3.0-36.0; P=0.02) (HOVON, TAD: median 7.4 x 10(6)/kg; range 2.0-33.0; VAD: median 9.4 x 10(6)/kg; range 0.0-48.7; P=0.009). However, engraftment after peripheral autologous stem cell transplantation showed no difference between Thal and VAD groups. We conclude that Thal as a part of induction regimen is associated with better response rates (GMMG-HD3: CR/PR 79%, VAD: CR/PR 58%; HOVON-50: TAD: CR/PR 81%, VAD: CR/PR 61%), but significantly affects the yield of PBSC collection.

Ectopic expression of Foxp3 in conventional T cells is indeed sufficient to confer suppressive activity, repress the production of cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and upregulate T(R)-cell-associated molecules such as CD25, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4, and glucocorticoid-induced TNF-receptor-family-related protein.

Here we show that the transcription factor AML1 (acute myeloid leukaemia 1)/Runx1 (Runt-related transcription factor 1), which is crucially required for normal haematopoiesis including thymic T-cell development, activates IL-2 and IFN-gamma gene expression in conventional CD4+ T cells through binding to their respective promoters. In natural T(R) cells, Foxp3 interacts physically with AML1. Several lines of evidence support a model in which the interaction suppresses IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, upregulates T(R)-cell-associated molecules, and exerts suppressive activity. This transcriptional control of T(R)-cell function by an interaction between Foxp3 and AML1 can be exploited to control physiological and pathological T-cell-mediated immune responses.","['Ono, Masahiro', 'Yaguchi, Hiroko', 'Ohkura, Naganari', 'Kitabayashi, Issay', 'Nagamura, Yuko', 'Nomura, Takashi', 'Miyachi, Yoshiki', 'Tsukada, Toshihiko', 'Sakaguchi, Shimon']","['Ono M', 'Yaguchi H', 'Ohkura N', 'Kitabayashi I', 'Nagamura Y', 'Nomura T', 'Miyachi Y', 'Tsukada T', 'Sakaguchi S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nature,Nature,0410462,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2006/12/12 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 2007 Apr 5;446(7136):685-9. doi: 10.1038/nature05673.

Cells deficient in both Bax and Bak do not undergo cell death during anoxia. However, the underlying mechanism of anoxia induced cell death is not well defined. Here we report our latest findings of two critical events that are required to induce cell death during anoxia. First, a key member of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins, Mcl-1, undergoes proteasomal-dependent degradation. The loss of Mcl-1 protein is independent of Bax or Bak indicating this is an early event in the apoptotic cascade. Second, cells inhibit the mitochondrial electron transport chain to negate the pro-survival function of Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L). These observations indicate that loss of pro-survival function is necessary for anoxia induced cell death.","['Shroff, Emelyn H', 'Snyder, Colleen', 'Chandel, Navdeep S']","['Shroff EH', 'Snyder C', 'Chandel NS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Apr 1;6(7):807-9. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.7.4044.

Understanding the specific steps in the germ cell apoptotic pathways that are affected by male contraceptives will allow more specific targeting in future contraceptive development. In this study, we have used a nonhuman primate model to characterize the key apoptotic pathway(s) in germ cell death after mild testicular hyperthermia, hormonal deprivation, or combined interventions. Groups of 8 adult (7- to 10-year-old) cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) received one of the following treatments: 1) two empty silastic implants; 2) two 5.5-cm testosterone (T) implants; 3) daily exposure of testes to heat (43 degrees C for 30 min) for 2 consecutive days; and 4) two T implants plus testicular heat exposure for two consecutive days. Testicular biopsies were performed before and at Days 3, 8, and 28 of treatment. Treatment with T, heat, or both led to sustained activation of both mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1/3 and MAPK14. Activation of MAPK1/3 and MAPK14 were accompanied by an increase in B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL) 2 levels in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of testicular lysates (BAX levels remained unaffected) and cytochrome c and DIABLO release from mitochondria. These treatments also resulted in inactivation of BCL2 through phosphorylation at serine 70, thereby favoring the death pathway. We conclude that the serine phosphorylation of BCL2 and activation of the MAPK14-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway are critical for male germ cell death in monkeys.","['Jia, Yue', 'Hikim, Amiya P Sinha', 'Lue, Yan-He', 'Swerdloff, Ronald S', 'Vera, Yanira', 'Zhang, Xue-Shen', 'Hu, Zhao-Yuan', 'Li, Yin-Chuan', 'Liu, Yi-Xun', 'Wang, Christina']","['Jia Y', 'Hikim AP', 'Lue YH', 'Swerdloff RS', 'Vera Y', 'Zhang XS', 'Hu ZY', 'Li YC', 'Liu YX', 'Wang C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Reprod,Biology of reproduction,0207224,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Reprod. 2007 Jul;77(1):83-92. doi: 10.1095/biolreprod.106.058594.

Following receptor activation of the envelope, the transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) is thought to undergo a series of fusogenic conformational transitions through a rod-like prehairpin intermediate to a compact trimer-of-hairpins structure. Importantly, synthetic peptides that interfere with the conformational changes of TM are potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and HTLV-1 entry, suggesting that TM is a valid target for antiviral therapy. To assess the utility of TM as a vaccine target and to explore further the function of TM in HTLV-1 pathogenesis, we have begun to examine the immunological properties of TM. Here we demonstrate that a recombinant trimer-of-hairpins form of the TM ectodomain is strongly immunogenic. Monoclonal antibodies raised against the TM immunogen specifically bind to trimeric forms of TM, including structures thought to be important for membrane fusion. Importantly, these antibodies recognize the envelope on virally infected cells but, surprisingly, fail to neutralize envelope-mediated membrane fusion or infection by pseudotyped viral particles. Our data imply that, even in the absence of overt membrane fusion, there are multiple forms of TM on virally infected cells and that some of these display fusion-associated structures. Finally, we demonstrate that many of the antibodies possess the ability to recruit complement to TM, suggesting that envelope-derived immunogens capable of eliciting a combination of neutralizing and complement-fixing antibodies would be of value as subunit vaccines for intervention in HTLV infections.","['Mirsaliotis, Antonis', 'Nurkiyanova, Kulpash', 'Lamb, Daniel', 'Woof, Jenny M', 'Brighty, David W']","['Mirsaliotis A', 'Nurkiyanova K', 'Lamb D', 'Woof JM', 'Brighty DW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC1900303,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(11):6019-31. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02544-06.

The viral transforming protein Tax regulates the transcription of viral and cellular genes by interacting with cellular transcription factors and coactivators. The effects of Tax on cellular gene expression have an important impact on HTLV-1-mediated cellular transformation. Expression of the c-fos cellular oncogene is regulated by serum response factor (SRF), and Tax is known to induce c-fos gene expression by activating SRF-responsive transcription. SRF activates cellular gene expression by binding to a consensus DNA sequence (CArG box) located within a serum response element (SRE). Since SRF activates transcription of many growth regulatory genes, this pathway is likely to have a significant impact on Tax-mediated transformation. Here we demonstrate that Tax interacts with SRF and enhances the binding of SRF to SREs located in the c-fos, Nur77, and viral promoters. Also, we establish that in the presence of Tax, SRF selects more divergent CArG box sequences than in the absence of Tax, revealing a novel mechanism for regulating SRF-responsive gene expression. Finally, increased association of SRF with chromatin and specific promoters was observed in Tax-expressing cells, correlating with increased c-fos and Nur77 mRNA levels in Tax-expressing cells.

Yet, immunologic surveillance mechanisms including sensitization to apoptotic signals mediated via the death receptor CD95 might contribute to leukemic control. Here, we show that primary B-cell precursor ALL cells from children escape from receptor-dependent cell death in 2 ways: Resting ALL blasts are protected from receptor-mediated apoptosis due to the absence of CD95 surface expression. However, even though CD40 ligation results in up-regulation of CD95, ALL blasts, unlike normal B cells, remain resistant to apoptosis. We show that this apoptosis resistance involves the selective up-regulation of the short isoforms of the caspase-8 inhibitor c-FLIP acting directly at the CD95 receptor level. Treatment with cycloheximide during CD40 activation prevents up-regulation of those c-FLIP isoforms and sensitizes ALL cells toward CD95-mediated apoptosis. We therefore propose that induction of the short c-FLIP isoforms inhibits the onset of CD95-induced apoptosis in primary CD40-stimulated ALL cells despite high CD95 expression.","['Troeger, Anja', 'Schmitz, Ingo', 'Siepermann, Meinolf', 'Glouchkova, Ludmila', 'Gerdemann, Ulrike', 'Janka-Schaub, Gritta E', 'Schulze-Osthoff, Klaus', 'Dilloo, Dagmar']","['Troeger A', 'Schmitz I', 'Siepermann M', 'Glouchkova L', 'Gerdemann U', 'Janka-Schaub GE', 'Schulze-Osthoff K', 'Dilloo D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):384-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-038398.

OTT1 has no established physiological function, but it shares homology with the spen/Mint/SHARP family of proteins defined by three amino-terminal RNA recognition motifs and a carboxyl-terminal SPOC (Spen paralog and ortholog carboxyl-terminal) domain believed to act as a transcriptional repressor. To define the role of OTT1 in hematopoiesis and help elucidate the mechanism of t(1,22) acute megakaryocytic leukemia pathogenesis, a conditional allele of Ott1 was generated in mice. Deletion of Ott1 in adult mice caused a loss of peripheral B cells due to a block in pro/pre-B differentiation. There is myeloid and megakaryocytic expansion in spleen and bone marrow, an increase in the Lin(-)Sca-1(+)c-Kit(+) compartment that includes hematopoietic stem cells, and a shift in progenitor fate toward granulocyte differentiation. These data show a requirement for Ott1 in B lymphopoiesis, and inhibitory roles in the myeloid, megakaryocytic, and progenitor compartments. The ability of Ott1 to affect hematopoietic cell fate and expansion in multiple lineages is a novel attribute for a spen family member and delineates Ott1 from other known effectors of hematopoietic development. It is plausible that dysregulation of Ott1-dependent hematopoietic developmental pathways, in particular those affecting the megakaryocyte lineage, may contribute to OTT1-MAL-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Raffel, Glen D', 'Mercher, Thomas', 'Shigematsu, Hirokazu', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Cullen, Dana E', 'Akashi, Koichi', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Raffel GD', 'Mercher T', 'Shigematsu H', 'Williams IR', 'Cullen DE', 'Akashi K', 'Bernard OA', 'Gilliland DG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC1851606,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Apr 3;104(14):6001-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0609041104.

This process is named receptor revision and has been observed in mature peripheral T cells from transgenic mice and human donors. However, whether thebreceptor revision in mature T cells is a random or orientated process remains poorly understood. Here we used the Jurkathuman T cell line, which represents a mature stage of T cell development, as a model to investigate the regulation of Tcell receptor (TCR) gene recombination. METHODS: TCR Dbeta-Jbeta signal joint T cell receptor excision DNA circles (sjTRECs) were determined by nested and seminested PCR. Double-strand DNA breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in the TCRVbeta chain locus were detected by ligation-mediated-PCR. Further analysis of the complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) size of the TCRVbeta chain was examined by the TCR GeneScan technique. RESULTS: RAG1, RAG2, and three crucial components of the nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) pathway were readily detected in Jurkat. Characteristics of junctional diversity of Dbeta2-Jbeta2 signal joints and ds RSS breaks associated with the Dbeta2 5' and Dbeta 2 3' sites were detected in DNA from Jurkat cells. CDR3 size and the gene sequences of the TCRVbeta chain did not change during cell proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: RAG1 and RAG2 and ongoing TCR gene recombination are coexpressed in Jurkat cells, but the ongoing recombination process may not play a role in modification of the TCR repertoire.However, the results suggest that Jurkat could be used as a model for studying the regulation of RAGs and V(D)J recombination and as a ""special"" model of the coexistence of TCR gene rearrangements and ""negative"" receptor revision.","['Zou, Hong-yun', 'Ma, Li', 'Meng, Min-jie', 'Yao, Xin-sheng', 'Lin, Ying', 'Wu, Zhen-qiang', 'He, Xiao-wei', 'Wang, Ju-fang', 'Wang, Xiao-ning']","['Zou HY', 'Ma L', 'Meng MJ', 'Yao XS', 'Lin Y', 'Wu ZQ', 'He XW', 'Wang JF', 'Wang XN']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,,2007/03/23 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/03/23 09:00'],"['2007/03/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/23 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2007 Mar 5;120(5):410-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RAG2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, mouse)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Nuclear/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'DNA Breaks', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genes, RAG-1', '*Genes, T-Cell Receptor', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic']",,,"['Institute of Molecular Immunology, School of Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No activating mutations were detected in the three TKs in MBL cell lines and primary cases. RON and TIE1 were each also expressed in about 35% and JAK2 in about 53% of HL cases. JAK2 genomic gains are frequent in MBL and HL but we observed no strict correlation of JAK2 genomic status with JAK2 protein expression. In conclusion, aberrant TK activities are a further shared pathogenic mechanism of MBL and HL and may be interesting targets for therapeutic intervention.","['Renne, C', 'Willenbrock, K', 'Martin-Subero, J I', 'Hinsch, N', 'Doring, C', 'Tiacci, E', 'Klapper, W', 'Moller, P', 'Kuppers, R', 'Hansmann, M-L', 'Siebert, R', 'Brauninger, A']","['Renne C', 'Willenbrock K', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Hinsch N', 'Doring C', 'Tiacci E', 'Klapper W', 'Moller P', 'Kuppers R', 'Hansmann ML', 'Siebert R', 'Brauninger A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):780-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404594.,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,,"['Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/enzymology/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/enzymology/genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']","['2404594 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404594 [doi]']",,"['Senckenberg Institute for Pathology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 24 h pre-treatment of Stro1+/GlycoA- or CD45-/GlycoA- subpopulations with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the IFNAR1 chain of the human type I IFN receptor (64G12), or with a polyclonal anti-IFNalpha antibody, resulted in a marked increase in the number of very large colonies (CFU-F >3000 cells) obtained in the presence of low, but necessary, concentrations of bFGF. Over a 2-month culture period, this short activation promoted a faster and greater amplification of mesenchymal progenitors for adipocytes and osteoblasts. Activation correlated with inhibition of STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation and of STAT1 nuclear translocation. A non-neutralizing anti-IFNAR1 mAb was ineffective. We demonstrate that control and activated MSCs express ST3GAL3, a sialyltransferase necessary to produce the embryonic antigens SSEA-3 and -4. Interestingly, activated MSC progeny expressed SSEA-3 and -4 at a higher level than control cultures, but this was not correlated with a significant expression of other embryonic markers. As MSCs represent an essential tool in tissue regeneration, the use of 64G12, which rapidly recruits a higher number of primitive cells, might increase amplification safety for cell therapy.","['Peiffer, I', 'Eid, P', 'Barbet, R', 'Li, M L', 'Oostendorp, R A J', 'Haydont, V', 'Monier, M-N', 'Milon, L', 'Fortunel, N', 'Charbord, P', 'Tovey, M', 'Hatzfeld, J', 'Hatzfeld, A']","['Peiffer I', 'Eid P', 'Barbet R', 'Li ML', 'Oostendorp RA', 'Haydont V', 'Monier MN', 'Milon L', 'Fortunel N', 'Charbord P', 'Tovey M', 'Hatzfeld J', 'Hatzfeld A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 Apr;21(4):714-24. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404589.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Extracellular Matrix/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-alpha/*physiology', 'Interferon-beta/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/pharmacology']","['2404589 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.leu.2404589 [doi]']",,"['CNRS Human Stem Cell Laboratory, rue Guy Moquet, Villejuif, France. hatzfeld@vjf.cnrs.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2007 Aug;21(8):1848'],,,,,

One important type of modification is acetylation of lysine residues of the N-terminal ""tails."" Because of the central role that covalent modifications like acetylation play in gene regulation, it is no wonder that there has been considerable interest directed towards identifying and characterizing the enzymes that catalyze these modifications. The MYST family is the largest but, until recently, one of the least well studied families of histone acetyltransferases. Experiments performed in the last few years show that MYST family proteins have a fascinating and diverse range of functions affecting almost all cellular phenomena. MYST family proteins have central and specific roles in regulating cellular processes ranging from apoptosis, cell cycle and adult stem cell homeostasis to patterning of the early embryo. Since these are fundamental cellular processes it is not surprising that mutations in MYST genes are also associated with pathological conditions such as leukemia.","['Thomas, Tim', 'Voss, Anne K']","['Thomas T', 'Voss AK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Mar 15;6(6):696-704. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.6.4013.

We quantified apoptosis in THP-1 cells incubated with idarubicin (IDA) alone or together with a low concentration of MG132 or bortezomib. The combination of both drugs yielded a percentage of apoptotic cells that was significantly higher than the additive effect of both drugs administered separately (p < 0.01). Isobologram analysis showed that both MG132 and bortezomib interacted synergistically with IDA to induce apoptosis of THP1 cells. Western blot analysis of Bax and Bim show an acumulation of these pro-apoptotic proteins in THP1 treated cells. This increase in Bim preceded the induction of apoptosis and participated in idarubicin-induced apoptosis. Proteasome inhibition also potentiated IDA-induced apoptosis in primary blast cells from 22 AML patients while no such effect was found on normal lymphocytes, PHA-stimulated lymphocytes, normal cord blood CD34+ cells or bone marrow normal myeloid cells.

Numerous studies have compared chromosomal banding analysis (CBA) and FISH on fixed cultured bone marrow cells. However, up to now, there has been no study comparing two main sources of diagnostic material, i.e. bone marrow aspirates and trephine biopsies. We therefore analyzed these materials by FISH in comparison with CBA. METHODS: CBA revealed chromosomal aberrations in 18 patients suffering from myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 13), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 3), or chronic myeloproliferative syndrome (n = 2). FISH was performed on fixed cultured bone marrow cells, aspirates and trephine biopsies from each patient. RESULTS: Percentages of aberrant cells in the different materials correlated highly with Pearson values of 0.909 for biopsy/fixed cultured cells (p < 0.001), 0.830 for biopsy/aspirate (p < 0.001) and 0.768 for aspirate/fixed cultured cells (p < 0.001). Moreover, in bone marrow biopsies peritrabecular and central intertrabecular areas yielded very similar FISH results with a high correlation (r = 0.968, p < 0.001). FISH revealed a lower proportion of aberrant cells than CBA in 90% of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the different materials available for the FISH examination are comparable in sensitivity and show similar quantitative results. Therefore, the use of biopsy sections for the routine FISH examination of chromosomal abnormalities is a valid method.","['Gerr, Heidrun', 'Gadzicki, Dorothea', 'Kreipe, Hans', 'Schlegelberger, Brigitte', 'Wilkens, Ludwig']","['Gerr H', 'Gadzicki D', 'Kreipe H', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Wilkens L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2006;73(6):271-9. doi: 10.1159/000099121.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Examination/*methods', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Banding', 'Female', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']","['000099121 [pii]', '10.1159/000099121 [doi]']","['Copyright 2006 S.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms in pediatric patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia over 30 years and to characterize late-occurring tumors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of 2169 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated between 1962 and 1998 at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenn, who achieved complete remission and had a median follow-up time of 18.7 years (range, 2.4-41.3 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidences of secondary neoplasms in first remission and standard incidence ratios of observed rates compared with rates of cancer development in the general US population. RESULTS: Secondary neoplasms developed as the first event in 123 patients and comprised 46 myeloid malignancies, 3 lymphomas, 14 basal cell carcinomas, 16 other carcinomas, 6 sarcomas, 16 meningiomas, and 22 other brain tumors. The cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasm was 4.17% (SE, 0.46%) at 15 years and increased substantially after 20 years, reaching 10.85% (SE, 1.27%) at 30 years. When meningiomas and basal cell carcinomas were excluded, the overall cumulative incidence was 3.99% (SE, 0.44%) at 15 years and 6.27% (SE, 0.83%) at 30 years, representing a 13.5-fold increase in overall risk compared with the general population. The cumulative incidence of each tumor type at 30 years was 2.19% (SE, 0.32%) for myeloid malignancy, 0.17% (SE, 0.10%) for lymphoma, 3.00% (SE, 0.59%) for brain tumor, 4.91% (SE, 1.04%) for carcinoma, and 0.57% (SE, 0.37%) for sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative incidence of secondary neoplasms increases steadily over 30 years after treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although the majority of the late-occurring secondary neoplasms are low-grade tumors, the increase in incidence of more aggressive malignant neoplasms is significantly higher than expected in the general population. These results suggest that lifelong follow-up of acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors is needed to ascertain the full impact of treatment and other leukemia-related factors on secondary neoplasm development.","['Hijiya, Nobuko', 'Hudson, Melissa M', 'Lensing, Shelly', 'Zacher, Margie', 'Onciu, Mihaela', 'Behm, Fred G', 'Razzouk, Bassem I', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Sandlund, John T', 'Rivera, Gaston K', 'Evans, William E', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Pui, Ching-Hon']","['Hijiya N', 'Hudson MM', 'Lensing S', 'Zacher M', 'Onciu M', 'Behm FG', 'Razzouk BI', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Evans WE', 'Relling MV', 'Pui CH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/03/24 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2007 Mar 21;297(11):1207-15. doi: 10.1001/jama.297.11.1207.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors', 'Time Factors']","['297/11/1207 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.297.11.1207 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA. nobuko.hijiya@stjude.org""]","['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ubp43 is an ISG15-specific isopeptidase, the expression of which is activated by IFN. Ubp43 knock-out mice are hypersensitive to IFN-alpha/beta and have enhanced resistance to lethal viral and bacterial infections. Here we show that in addition to protection against foreign pathogens, Ubp43 deficiency increases the resistance to oncogenic transformation by BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL viral transduction/transplantation of wild-type bone marrow cells results in the rapid development of a chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative disease; in contrast, a significantly increased latency of disease development is observed following BCR-ABL viral transduction/transplantation of Ubp43-deficient bone marrow cells. This resistance to leukemic development is dependent on type 1 IFN (IFN-alpha/beta) signaling in Ubp43-deficient cells. Increased levels of type 1 IFN are also detected in the serum of CML mice. These results suggest that inhibition of Ubp43-negative effect on IFN signaling can potentiate the response to increased endogenous IFN levels in innate immune responses against cancer development, indicating that pharmacological inhibition of Ubp43 may be of benefit in cancers and others diseases in which interferon is currently prescribed.","['Yan, Ming', 'Luo, Jiann-Kae', 'Ritchie, Kenneth J', 'Sakai, Ikuya', 'Takeuchi, Kasuto', 'Ren, Ruibao', 'Zhang, Dong-Er']","['Yan M', 'Luo JK', 'Ritchie KJ', 'Sakai I', 'Takeuchi K', 'Ren R', 'Zhang DE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1896118,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):305-12. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-033209.

Both NOXA and Bim are avid binders of Mcl-1, but a functional linkage between these BH3-only proteins has not yet been reported. In this study, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 binding of endogenously induced NOXA interferes with the ability of Mcl-1 to efficiently sequester endogenous Bim, as Bim is displaced from its complex with Mcl-1. Induced NOXA significantly enhances the UV sensitivity of cells, and the ensuing mitochondrial depolarization is entirely abrogated by Bim knockdown. These results demonstrate a Mcl-1-mediated cross-talk between endogenous NOXA and Bim that occurs upstream of the Bak/Bax-dependent execution of UV-induced mitochondrial depolarization. The current findings demonstrate that the mitochondrial response to an induced expression of NOXA is executed by endogenous Bim and suggest a plausible mechanism for the observed NOXA-Bim linkage.","['Han, Jie', 'Goldstein, Leslie A', 'Hou, Wen', 'Rabinowich, Hannah']","['Han J', 'Goldstein LA', 'Hou W', 'Rabinowich H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/07/20 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 Jun 1;282(22):16223-31. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M611186200.

The genetic phenotype of myeloid leukemic K562 cells includes the suppression of cytosolic sialidase Neu2. Neu2 transfection in K562 cells induced a marked decrease (-30% and -80%) of the mRNA of the anti-apoptotic factors Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, respectively, and an almost total disappearance of Bcl-2 protein. In addition, gene expression and activity of Bcr-Abl underwent a 35% diminution, together with a marked decrease of Bcr-Abl-dependent Src and Lyn kinase activity. Thus, the antiapoptotic axis Bcr-Abl, Src, and Lyn, which stimulates the formation of Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, was remarkably weakened. The ultimate consequences of these modifications were an increased susceptibility to apoptosis of K562 cells and a marked reduction of their proliferation rate. The molecular link between Neu2 activity and Bcr-Abl signaling pathway may rely on the desialylation of some cytosolic glycoproteins. In fact, three cytosolic glycoproteins, in the range 45-66 kDa, showed a 50-70% decrease of their sialic acid content upon Neu2 expression, supporting their possible role as modulators of the Bcr-Abl complex.","['Tringali, Cristina', 'Lupo, Barbara', 'Anastasia, Luigi', 'Papini, Nadia', 'Monti, Eugenio', 'Bresciani, Roberto', 'Tettamanti, Guido', 'Venerando, Bruno']","['Tringali C', 'Lupo B', 'Anastasia L', 'Papini N', 'Monti E', 'Bresciani R', 'Tettamanti G', 'Venerando B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 May 11;282(19):14364-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M700406200.

Cancer stem cells, or cancer initiating cells have been described in the context of acute myeloid leukemia, breast, brain, bone, lung, melanoma and prostate. These cells have been shown to be critical in tumor development and should harbor the mutations needed to initiate a tumor. The origin of the cancer stem cells is not clear. They may be derived from stem cell pools, progenitor cells or differentiated cells that undergo trans-differentiation processes. It has been suggested that cell fusion and/or horizontal gene transfer events, which may occur in tissue repair processes, also might play an important role in tumor initiation and progression. Fusion between somatic cells that have undergone a set of specific mutations and normal stem cells might explain the extensive chromosomal derangements seen in early tumors. Centrosome deregulation can be an integrating factor in many of the mechanisms involved in tumor development. The regulation of the balance between cell renewal and cell death is critical in cancer. Increased knowledge of developmental aspects in relation to self-renewal and differentiation, both under normal and deregulated conditions, will probably shed more light on the mechanisms that lead to tumor initiation and progression.","['Tysnes, Berit B', 'Bjerkvig, Rolf']","['Tysnes BB', 'Bjerkvig R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2006/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/26 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2007 Jun;1775(2):283-97. doi: 10.1016/j.bbcan.2007.01.001.

These pleiotropic functions are reflected by its complex and dynamic expression pattern during hematopoiesis. Factors regulating this complex expression are only beginning to be revealed.

Evidence suggests that this chimeric gene fusion constitutes an initiating mutation that is necessary but insufficient for the development of leukemia. In a search for additional genetic events that could be linked to the development of leukemia, we applied a genome-wide array-comparative genomic hybridization technique to 24 TEL-AML1 leukemia samples and two cell lines. It was found that at least two chromosomal imbalances were involved in all samples. Recurrent regions of chromosomal imbalance (>10% of cases) and representative involved genes were gain of chromosomes 10 (17%) and 21q (25%; RUNX1) and loss of 12p13.2 (87%; TEL), 9p21.3 (29%; p16INK4a/ARF), 9p13.2 (25%; PAX5), 12q21.3 (25%; BTG1), 3p21 (21%; LIMD1), 6q21 (17%; AIM1 and BLIMP1), 4q31.23 (17%; NR3C2), 11q22-q23 (13%; ATM) and 19q13.11-q13.12 (13%; PDCD5).

Organ transplantation using a HBsAg-positive donor can lead to post-transplantation de novo HBV infection and severe HBV-related hepatitis if no effective prophylactic measures are taken prior to and after transplantation. In this report, a four-level approach was designed for a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia, beginning with a booster HBV vaccination before performing BMT with a HBsAg-positive donor. Prior to BMT, the HBV viral load of the donor was reduced to an undetectable level by antiviral therapy. After BMT, hepatitis B immunoglobulin was administered intramuscularly for 1 wk together with a long-term antiviral drug, lamivudine.

The methods are motivated by radon data from an epidemiologic study of residential radon in Iowa that include 2726 outdoor and indoor measurements. Prediction of county-average radon is based on a geostatistical model for the radon data which assumes an underlying continuous spatial process. In the radon model, we account for uncertainties due to incomplete spatial coverage, spatial variability, characteristic differences between homes, and detector measurement error. The predicted radon averages are, in turn, included as a covariate in Poisson models for incident cases of acute lymphocytic (ALL), acute myelogenous (AML), chronic lymphocytic (CLL), and chronic myelogenous (CML) leukaemias reported to the Iowa cancer registry from 1973 to 2002. Since radon and leukaemia risk are modelled simultaneously in our approach, the resulting risk estimates accurately reflect uncertainties in the predicted radon exposure covariate. Posterior mean (95 per cent Bayesian credible interval) estimates of the relative risk associated with a 1 pCi/L increase in radon for ALL, AML, CLL, and CML are 0.91 (0.78-1.03), 1.01 (0.92-1.12), 1.06 (0.96-1.16), and 1.12 (0.98-1.27), respectively.","['Smith, Brian J', 'Zhang, Lixun', 'Field, R William']","['Smith BJ', 'Zhang L', 'Field RW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,2007/03/22 09:00,2008/02/06 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2007 Nov 10;26(25):4619-42. doi: 10.1002/sim.2884.,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', 'Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)']",IM,,"['*Bayes Theorem', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iowa/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', '*Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Radon/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment']",['10.1002/sim.2884 [doi]'],"['Copyright 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009, U.S.A. brian-j-smith@uiowa.edu']","['P30 ES05605/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA85942/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES05653/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin, a-1-acid glycoprotein, albuminumin, transferrin, copper, zinc, manganese, and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity were measured, and compared with those from a healthy control group. The serum from 34 patients with CLL were extracted before chemotherapy. Serum transferrin, albuminumin and Zinc concentrations were lower in patients with CLL while serum a-1-acid glycoprotein, ceruloplasmin, copper concentrations, and ceruloplasmin oxidase activity were higher in CLL patients when compared with the control group. Although serum manganese concentration was lower in CLL groups than in the control group, the difference was not statistically significant. Serum transferrin concentration was lower in the early stage group compared with the advanced stage. Serum ceruloplasmin level positively correlated with serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity in patients from the early stage group. Serum ceruloplasmin level positively correlated with serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity in patients with advanced stage. In conclusion, increased serum ceruloplasmin oxidase activity, ceruloplasmin, a-1-acid glycoprotein, copper levels and decreased transferrin and albuminumin, unchanged manganese levels are associated with CLL and appear to be a consequence of the disease itself.","['Gundogdu, M', 'Kaya, H', 'Gulcin, I', 'Erdem, F', 'Cayir, K', 'Keles, M', 'Yilmaz, A']","['Gundogdu M', 'Kaya H', 'Gulcin I', 'Erdem F', 'Cayir K', 'Keles M', 'Yilmaz A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Scotland,Scott Med J,Scottish medical journal,2983335R,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scott Med J. 2007 Feb;52(1):24-7. doi: 10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.24.,"['0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Trace Elements)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Ceruloplasmin/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Trace Elements/*blood', 'Transferrin/analysis']",['10.1258/rsmsmj.52.1.24 [doi]'],,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Ataturk University, Medical School, Erzurum, Turkey. gundogdu@atauni.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This article reviews the dermatologic uses and effects of deferasirox, bortezomib, dasatinib, and cyclosporine eye drops. Deferasirox--an oral iron chelator--could be an effective treatment against porphyria cutanea tarda, hemochromatosis, and pathogens such as mucor that thrive in iron rich environments. Bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor and multiple myeloma treatment, may be effective against nodular amyloid and has been effectively used against squamous cell carcinoma; although trials demonstrate it is ineffective against metastatic melanoma. Bortezomib has many cutaneous side effects including erythematous plaques or nodules, a generalized morbilliform erythema with ulcerations and fever, purpuric eruptions, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, Sweet's syndrome, and folliculitis. Dasatinib is a multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor active in vitro against most cell lines containing BCR-ABL mutations that confer resistance to imatinib. Dasatinib is likely to be effective against dermatofibroma sarcoma protuberans and cutaneous acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and has caused panniculitis. Cyclosporine 0.05% ocular emulsion (eye drops) are approved to treat dry eyes including dry eyes caused by collagen vascular disease. Cyclosporine eye drops might also have utility in treating eye pathology of ocular rosacea, atopic keratoconjunctivitis, graft versus host disease, herpes keratitis, chronic sarcoidosis of the conjunctiva, conjunctival manifestations of actinic prurigo, keratitis of keratitis-ichthyosis deafness (KID) syndrome, and lichen planus-related kerato-conjunctivitis. This article speculates that cyclosporine eye drops would also be useful for any disease causing ectropion or eclabion of the eye as well as toxic epidermal necrolysis-related eye pathology (in particular corneal scarring).","['Scheinfeld, Noah']",['Scheinfeld N'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Drugs Dermatol,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,101160020,,2007/03/22 09:00,2007/04/24 09:00,['2007/03/22 09:00'],"['2007/03/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/24 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Drugs Dermatol. 2007 Mar;6(3):352-5.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'V8G4MOF2V9 (Deferasirox)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzoates/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cyclosporine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib', 'Deferasirox', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Ophthalmic Solutions', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Skin Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",,,"[""Department of Dermatology, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.""]",,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patterns of incidence and latency of secondary lymphomas is distinct from that of myeloid malignancies and other solid cancers. We have systematically analyzed and summarized reports from various groups over the last three decades. Risk of secondary lymphomas increases after the first 5 years of completion of chemotherapy or radiotherapy and persists for more than three decades.

To investigate the mechanism of relapse, 27 matched diagnosis and relapse ALL samples were analyzed for clonal populations using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of multiple antigen receptor gene rearrangements. These clonal markers revealed the emergence of apparently new populations at relapse in 13 patients. More sensitive clone-specific PCR revealed that, in 8 cases, these ""relapse clones"" were present at diagnosis and a significant relationship existed between presence of the relapse clone at diagnosis and time to first relapse (P < .007). Furthermore, in cases where the relapse clone could be quantified, time to first relapse was dependent on the amount of the relapse clone at diagnosis (r = -0.84; P = .018). This observation, together with demonstrated differential chemosensitivity between subclones at diagnosis, argues against therapy-induced acquired resistance as the mechanism of relapse in the informative patients. Instead these data indicate that relapse in ALL patients may commonly involve selection of a minor intrinsically resistant subclone that is undetectable by routine PCR-based methods. Relapse prediction may be improved with strategies to detect minor potentially resistant subclones early during treatment, hence allowing intensification of therapy.","['Choi, Seoyeon', 'Henderson, Michelle J', 'Kwan, Edward', 'Beesley, Alex H', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Bahar, Anita Y', 'Giles, Jodie', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Pozza, Luciano Dalla', 'Baker, David L', 'Marshall, Glenn M', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D']","['Choi S', 'Henderson MJ', 'Kwan E', 'Beesley AH', 'Sutton R', 'Bahar AY', 'Giles J', 'Venn NC', 'Pozza LD', 'Baker DL', 'Marshall GM', 'Kees UR', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 15;110(2):632-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-01-067785.

The mechanism of metabolic protection from apoptosis, however, has been unclear. Here we identify a novel signaling pathway initiated by glucose catabolism that inhibited apoptotic death of growth factor-deprived cells. We show that increased glucose metabolism protected cells against the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Bim and attenuated degradation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1. Maintenance of Mcl-1 was critical for this protection, as glucose metabolism failed to protect Mcl-1-deficient cells from apoptosis. Increased glucose metabolism stabilized Mcl-1 in both cell lines and primary lymphocytes via inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha and 3beta (GSK-3alpha/beta), which otherwise promoted Mcl-1 degradation. While a number of kinases can phosphorylate and inhibit GSK-3alpha/beta, we provide evidence that protein kinase C may be stimulated by glucose-induced alterations in diacylglycerol levels or distribution to phosphorylate GSK-3alpha/beta, maintain Mcl-1 levels, and inhibit cell death. These data provide a novel nutrient-sensitive mechanism linking glucose metabolism and Bcl-2 family proteins via GSK-3 that may promote survival of cells with high rates of glucose utilization, such as growth factor-stimulated or cancerous cells.","['Zhao, Yuxing', 'Altman, Brian J', 'Coloff, Jonathan L', 'Herman, Catherine E', 'Jacobs, Sarah R', 'Wieman, Heather L', 'Wofford, Jessica A', 'Dimascio, Leah N', 'Ilkayeva, Olga', 'Kelekar, Ameeta', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Rathmell, Jeffrey C']","['Zhao Y', 'Altman BJ', 'Coloff JL', 'Herman CE', 'Jacobs SR', 'Wieman HL', 'Wofford JA', 'Dimascio LN', 'Ilkayeva O', 'Kelekar A', 'Reya T', 'Rathmell JC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC1900055,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/07/10 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 Jun;27(12):4328-39. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00153-07.

Specific enzyme inhibitors or drugs that interfere with these metabolic pathways have proven to be potential anticancer agents. Since DNA methylation and polyamine metabolism depend on a common substrate, i.e. S-adenosylmethionine, interaction between both pathways can be expected. Little is known about the relationship between these pathways but studies are available indicating that polyamines and DNA methylation are directly or indirectly interconnected, metabolically as well as physiologically with respect to the regulation of cell growth, differentiation and cancer development. These considerations give rise to the possibility that, by targeting both pathways, a more profound and effective inhibitory effect on the growth of malignant cells can be achieved. In previous studies we showed that 6-MP (6-mercaptopurine) as well as MTX (methotrexate), well-known drugs in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, inhibit DNA methylation and induce apoptosis in malignant blood cells. Our recent results show that combined treatment with 6-MP, MTX and drugs interfering with polyamine metabolism has additive/synergistic effects on the growth, cell viability and/or apoptotic death of leukaemic cells. Such a combination therapy could have great clinical value for patients in which therapy using inhibitors of thiopurines/purine metabolism has failed.","['Schipper, R G', 'van den Heuvel, L P', 'Verhofstad, A A J', 'De Abreu, R A']","['Schipper RG', 'van den Heuvel LP', 'Verhofstad AA', 'De Abreu RA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2007 Apr;35(Pt 2):331-5. doi: 10.1042/BST0350331.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Polyamines)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)']",IM,,"['Child', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/metabolism']","['BST0350331 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0350331 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, University Medical Centre Nijmegen, 6500 HB, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. raymond.schipper@wur.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study tests the hypothesis that birth in Texas counties with moderate to intense agricultural activity increases childhood cancer risk. This case-control study analyzed 6974 cases and controls ages 0 to 14, identified through the Texas Cancer Registry and Texas birth records, respectively. Exposure data were obtained from the Census of Agriculture. Percent cropland in the county of birth and total county-specific pesticide exposure incorporating the EPA's carcinogenicity classification served as surrogates for pesticide exposure. Cancer sites examined include: all cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, CNS tumors, and several specific subsites. Elevated, although not statistically significant, ORs for the association between birth in counties with > or =50% cropland were produced for all CNS tumors (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.9-1.8), astrocytoma (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 0.8-2.2), and PNET (OR = 1.3, 95% CI = 0.7-2.5). A similar pattern was not observed using the index of total county-specific pesticide exposure. Although imprecise, these exposure assessment methods represent novel applications of agricultural census data. Although a pattern of increased risk was observed between percent cropland and CNS tumors, this study's results do not support an association between birth in Texas counties with moderate to intense agricultural activity and childhood cancer. Due to study limitations, such an association should not be ruled out.

MN1 is a transcription coactivator of the retinoic acid and vitamin D receptors, and TEL (ETV6) is a member of the E26-transformation-specific family of transcription factors. In MN1-TEL, the transactivating domains of MN1 are combined with the DNA-binding domain of TEL. We show that MN1-TEL inhibits retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transcription, counteracts coactivators such as p160 and p300, and acts as a dominant-negative mutant of MN1. Compared to MN1, the same transactivation domains in MN1-TEL are poorly stimulated by p160, p300 or histone deacetylase inhibitors, indicating that the block of RAR-mediated transcription by MN1-TEL is caused by dysfunctional transactivation domains rather than by recruitment of corepressors. The mechanism leading to myeloid leukemia in t(12;22) thus differs from the translocations that involve RAR itself.","['van Wely, K H M', 'Meester-Smoor, M A', 'Janssen, M J F W', 'Aarnoudse, A-J', 'Grosveld, G C', 'Zwarthoff, E C']","['van Wely KH', 'Meester-Smoor MA', 'Janssen MJ', 'Aarnoudse AJ', 'Grosveld GC', 'Zwarthoff EC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Aug 23;26(39):5733-40. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210382.

ABL gene amplification and NOTCH1 gene mutations in subsets of pre-T ALL/LBL suggest patients may benefit from therapy with tyrosine kinase and gamma-secretase inhibitors, respectively. Acute biphenotypic leukemias are characterized by a single population of blasts that express myeloid, T- or B-lineage antigens in various combinations and account for fewer than 4% of all acute leukemias.

Nuclear proteins play a central role in regulating gene expression, but are often under-represented in proteomic studies due to their lower abundance in comparison to cellular 'housekeeping' metabolic enzymes and structural proteins. A reliable procedure for separation and proteomic analysis of nuclear proteins would be useful for investigations of cell proliferation and differentiation during disease processes (e.g., human cancer). In this study, we have purified nuclei from the human Burkitt's lymphoma B-cell line, Raji, using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The integrity and purity of the nuclei were assessed by light microscopy and proteins from the nuclear fractions were separated by 2-DE and identified using matrix assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). A total of 124 unique proteins were identified, of which 91% (n=110) were predicted to be nuclear using PSORT. Proteins from the nuclear fraction were subjected to affinity chromatography on DNA-agarose to isolate DNA-binding proteins. From this purified fraction, 131 unique proteins were identified, of which 69% (n=90) were known or predicted DNA-binding proteins. Purification of nuclei and subsequent enrichment of DNA-binding proteins allowed identification of a total of 209 unique proteins, many involved in transcription and/or correlated with lymphoma, leukemia or cancer in general. The data obtained should be valuable for identification of biomarkers and targets for cancer therapy, and for furthering our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphoma development and progression.","['Henrich, Silke', 'Cordwell, Stuart J', 'Crossett, Ben', 'Baker, Mark S', 'Christopherson, Richard I']","['Henrich S', 'Cordwell SJ', 'Crossett B', 'Baker MS', 'Christopherson RI']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/26 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2007 Apr;1774(4):413-32. doi: 10.1016/j.bbapap.2006.12.011.

In contrast to no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 MAPK and Akt, an activation of JNK was noted when K562 cells were exposed to CTX III. CTX III-mediated G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis were reduced by treatment with the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125, but not by ERK and p38MAPK inhibitors. Further investigation showed that the specific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, reduced the activation of caspase-3, caspase-9, and reversed the decline in the expression of cyclin B1.

Although the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid is an outstanding example, the full potential of retinoids in oncology has not yet been explored and a more generalized use of these compounds is not yet a reality. One way to enhance the therapeutic and chemopreventive activity of RA and derivatives is to identify rational combinations between these compounds and other pharmacological agents. This is now possible given the information available on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of retinoids. At the cellular level, the antileukemia and anticancer activity of retinoids is the result of three main actions, cytodifferentiation, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. Cytodifferentiation is a particularly attractive modality of treatment and differentiating agents promise to be less toxic and more specific than conventional chemotherapy. This is the result of the fact that cytotoxicity is not the primary aim of differentiation therapy. At the molecular level, retinoids act through the activation of nuclear retinoic acid receptor-dependent and -independent pathways. The cellular pathways and molecular networks relevant for retinoid activity are modulated by a panoply of other intracellular and extracellular pathways that may be targeted by known drugs and other experimental therapeutics. This chapter aims to summarize and critically discuss the available knowledge in the field.","['Garattini, Enrico', ""Gianni', Maurizio"", 'Terao, Mineko']","['Garattini E', ""Gianni' M"", 'Terao M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Vitam Horm,Vitamins and hormones,0413601,,2007/03/21 09:00,2008/06/06 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vitam Horm. 2007;75:301-54. doi: 10.1016/S0083-6729(06)75012-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Chemoprevention/methods', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/methods', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Retinoids/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']","['S0083-6729(06)75012-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0083-6729(06)75012-9 [doi]']",,"['Laboratorio di Biologia Molecolare, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, via Eritrea 62, 20157 Milano, Italy.']",,,,298,,,,,,,,,,,,

In AML only a few cells have properties allowing for ongoing proliferation and for expansion of this malignant disorder. These very primitive cells, referred to as leukemic stem cells, reside mostly in a quiescent cell cycle state. These cells have the capacity of self-renewal and are likely characterized by a high expression of a number of ABC transporters. In addition, over-expression of certain ABC transporters in leukemic cells has been associated with poor treatment outcome in AML patients. Therefore, to be able to improve diagnostics and therapies for AML patients, it may be important to better characterize this quiescent stem cell population.

Also, the effects of pisosterol on normal human cells were examined in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The effects on cell viability and morphological changes were the first indications showing that pisosterol induces HL-60 differentiation. The demonstration of blue tetrazolium reduction in HL-60 cells exposed to pisosterol demonstrated differentiation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, reaching a maximum effect after 72 h incubation at 5 microg/mL. Assays for alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase activity indicated that pisosterol triggers differentiation towards a monocytic cell-like pathway. The antiproliferative effect of pisosterol was determined by inhibition of DNA synthesis based on BrdU incorporation into HL-60 proliferating cells. It appears that pisosterol-treated cells, despite displaying a differentiated phenotype, continued to proliferate at all doses tested after 72 h, with a slightly decrease at 5 microg/mL. Apoptosis was observed in pisosterol-treated cells in a dose-dependent way. Nevertheless, after the same period of incubation, no cytotoxicity was detected in PBMC in the presence of pisosterol even at 25 microg/mL, providing some evidence that pisosterol may be selective for tumor cells. The mechanisms underlying the effect of pisosterol in leukemia cells indicates the induction of a monocytic cell-like differentiation, suggesting that this compound could be used in the development of new pharmacological tools with potential therapeutic value in the management of leukemia with fewer side effects.","['Montenegro, Raquel Carvalho', 'de Vasconcellos, Marne Carvalho', 'Silva Bezerra, Franciglauber', 'Andrade-Neto, Manoel', 'Pessoa, Claudia', 'de Moraes, Manoel Odorico', 'Costa-Lotufo, Leticia Veras']","['Montenegro RC', 'de Vasconcellos MC', 'Silva Bezerra F', 'Andrade-Neto M', 'Pessoa C', 'de Moraes MO', 'Costa-Lotufo LV']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/09/26 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2007 Aug;21(5):795-800. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2007.01.018.

Based on established WHO bone marrow features, and the use of new molecular and laboratory markers including JAK2(V617F) mutation, endogenous erythroid colony (EEC) formation and serum erythropoietin (EPO), we present updated European clinical, molecular and pathological (ECMP) criteria for the differential diagnosis of true ET, PV and CIMF. As compared to the WHO bone marrow features, each of the laboratory and molecular markers are not sensitive enough for the diagnosis and classification of the three prefibrotic MPDs. The proposed WHO/ECMP criteria reduce the platelet count to the upper limit of normal (>400x10(9)l(-1)) as inclusion criterion for the diagnosis of thrombocythemia in true ET, early stages of PV and prefibrotic CIMF. The combined use of WHO and ECMP criteria differentiate PV from congenital and acquired erythrocytosis, true ET from reactive thrombocytosis and separates true ET from CIMF-0/1 mimicking ET. Only half of the patients with true ET and CIMF carry the JAK2(V617F) mutation (sensitivity 50%). Early PV mimicking ET is featured by the presence of JAK2(V617F) mutation, EEC, low serum EPO levels, normal hematocrit, and increased bone marrow cellularity due to increased erythropoiesis (""forme fruste"" PV) when WHO/ECMP criteria are applied. The combination of JAK2(V617F) PCR test and increased hematocrit is diagnostic for PV (sensitivity 95%, specificity 100%). The degree of JAK2(V617F) positivity of granulocytes is related to disease stage: heterozygous in true ET and early PV and mixed hetero/homozygous to homozygous in overt and advanced PV and CIMF. Bone marrow histology assessment should remain the gold standard criterion for the diagnosis and staging of the MPDs true ET, PV and CIMF and its differentiation from primary or secondary erythrocytosis, reactive thrombocytosis and thrombocythemias associated with atypical MPD, myelodysplastic syndromes, and chronic myeloid leukemia,. The proposed WHO/ECMP criteria allow a cross talk between clinicians, pathologists and scientists to much better characterize the nature and natural history of each of the WHO/CMP defined early and overt MPDs.","['Michiels, Jan Jacques', 'De Raeve, Hendrik', 'Hebeda, Konnie', 'Lam, King H', 'Berneman, Zwi', 'Schroyens, Wilfried', 'Schwarz, Jiri']","['Michiels JJ', 'De Raeve H', 'Hebeda K', 'Lam KH', 'Berneman Z', 'Schroyens W', 'Schwarz J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/08/23 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2006/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Aug;31(8):1031-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.01.021.

Although the 24 N-terminal amino acids encoded by exon 2, which were previously shown to be essential for nuclear targeting, did not appear to contain typical basic nuclear localization signals, these residues were able to efficiently convey the GFP protein into the nucleus, suggesting a role in promoting nuclear translocation. In assays using a series of N-terminal truncation IE1 mutants, which were forced to enter the nucleus, exon 2 was completely dispensable for POD disruption.

In agreement, AML1-ETO overexpression in leukemic U937 cells activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), while its specific inhibitor SP600125 effectively abrogated AML1-ETO-induced Cx43 expression, indicating that JNK signaling pathway contributes to AML1-ETO induced Cx43 expression.

The present study compared CTLA-4 expression and function of leukaemic cells from AML patients at diagnosis with those from AML patients resistant to conventional chemotherapy. We also explored the possibility of targeting CTLA-4 for apoptosis induction in chemoresistant AML cells. AML cells either from untreated patients (n = 15) or in chemoresistant phase (n = 10) were analysed for CTLA-4 protein and transcript expression by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction respectively. CTLA-4 expression was similar in untreated and in chemoresistant samples and was not associated with patients' clinical features. In chemoresistant AML cells, CTLA-4 transduced an apoptotic signal on engagement with its recombinant ligands r-CD80 and r-CD86, which induced an average of 71% and 62% apoptotic cells, respectively, at highest concentration. Apoptosis was equally induced in untreated leukaemic cells accompanied by cleavage of procaspase-8 and -3. Thus, this study provides the first evidence that killing of leukaemic cells from AML patients may be obtained by the engagement of CTLA-4 with its ligands, opening the way to a novel potential therapeutic approach based on triggering the CTLA-4 molecule to circumvent chemoresistance in AML.","['Laurent, Stefania', 'Palmisano, Giulio L', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Kato, Tomohiro', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Clavio, Marino', 'Dozin, Beatrice', 'Balbi, Giuseppe', 'Megna, Mauro', 'Morabito, Anna', 'Lamparelli, Teresa', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Pistillo, Maria Pia']","['Laurent S', 'Palmisano GL', 'Martelli AM', 'Kato T', 'Tazzari PL', 'Pierri I', 'Clavio M', 'Dozin B', 'Balbi G', 'Megna M', 'Morabito A', 'Lamparelli T', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Gobbi M', 'Pistillo MP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(4):597-608. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06472.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (CTLA-4 Antigen)', '0 (CTLA4 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen/metabolism', 'CTLA-4 Antigen', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']","['BJH6472 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06472.x [doi]']",,"['Unit of Translational Research A, National Cancer Research Institute, Genova, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Defective BTK expression in leukaemic B-cell precursors from infants with t(4;11) acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has been associated with radiation resistance. The present study examined whether BTK mediates apoptosis during oxidative stress by interfering with the anti-apoptotic function of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). BTK physically associated with and tyrosine phosphorylated STAT3; this association was promoted by pervanadate (PV)-induced oxidative stress. The BTK/STAT3 interaction appeared to prevent STAT3 response to oxidative stress, because PV-induced STAT3 activation was markedly enhanced in DT40 chicken lymphoma B-cells that were rendered BTK-deficient by targeted disruption of the btk gene as well as in BTK-deficient RAMOS-1 human lymphoma B-cells. These BTK-deficient cells were highly resistant to oxidative stress-induced apoptosis triggered by PV treatment. Reconstitution of BTK-deficient DT40 cells with wild-type human BTK gene eliminated the amplification of the STAT3 response and restored the PV-induced apoptotic signal. Similarly, while the BTK-positive NALM-6 human leukaemic B-cell precursor cell line showed no STAT3 activation after PV treatment and was exquisitely sensitive to PV-induced apoptosis, PV failed to induce apoptosis in BTK-deficient RAMOS-1 human lymphoma B-cells that showed a robust STAT3 response. These results provide unprecedented biochemical and genetic evidence for a unique mode of cross-talk that occurs between BTK and STAT3 pathways during oxidative stress, whereby BTK may trigger apoptosis via negative regulation of the anti-apoptotic STAT3 activity.","['Uckun, Fatih', 'Ozer, Zahide', 'Vassilev, Alexei']","['Uckun F', 'Ozer Z', 'Vassilev A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Feb;136(4):574-89. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06468.x.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (pervanadate)', '3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']","['BJH6468 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06468.x [doi]']",,"['Parker Hughes Cancer Center, Roseville, MN 55113, USA. fatih_uckun@tmo.blackberry.net']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a fairly homogeneous pattern of markers expressed by most pDCL, numerous distinctive features (e.g. cytological aspects and aberrant marker expression) have been reported. This may be related to the 'lineage-independent developmental' programme of dendritic cells, which may be able to develop from either immature or already committed haematopoietic progenitors. This highlights the need for specific validated markers to diagnose such aggressive leukaemia. Here, we propose--among others (e.g. T-cell leukaemia 1)--blood dendritic cell antigen-2 and high levels of CD123 expression as potential markers.

METHODS: All patients admitted between March, 1996 and February, 2004 were analyzed and 137 were included in this retrospective, nonrandomized, institutional study. The rates of microdontia, taurodontia, anodontia, macrodontia, blunt root, and tapered root were assessed. RESULTS: The patients were distributed into 2 groups: (1) those with lymphoproliferative neoplasias (61%); and (2) those with solid tumors (39%). Their mean age when treatment began was 5 years and 6 months. Dental abnormalities were found in 39 (29%) patients, while 98 (72%) patients did not present any abnormality. The abnormalities found were: (1) microdontia (7%; N= 10); (2) anodontia (6%; N=8); (3) taurodontia (14%; N=19); (4) macrodontia (5%; N=7); (5) blunted root (2%; N=2); and (6) tapered root (4%; N=5). Of these patients: 22% (N=30) presented 1 abnormality; 4% (N=6) presented 2 abnormalities; and 2% (N=3) presented 3 abnormalities. CONCLUSION: Taurodontia was the most frequent abnormality found in children and adolescents who underwent antineoplastic treatment, and its rate was significantly higher than those found for the healthy Brazilian population.

Because case and comparison families had similar levels of these contaminants, we conducted genetic studies to identify gene polymorphisms that might have made case children more susceptible than comparison children to effects of the exposures. DESIGN: We compared case with comparison children to determine whether differences existed in the frequency of polymorphic genes, including genes that code for enzymes in the folate and purine pathways. We also included discovery of polymorphic forms of genes that code for enzymes that are inhibited by tungsten: xanthine dehydrogenase, sulfite oxidase (SUOXgene), and aldehyde oxidase. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven case children were age- and sex-matched with 42 community comparison children for genetic analyses. Twenty parents of case children also contributed to the analyses. RESULTS: One bilalleleic gene locus in SUOX was significantly associated with either case or comparison status, depending on which alleles the child carried (without adjusting for multiple comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Although genetic studies did not provide evidence that a common agent or genetic susceptibility factor caused the leukemias, the association between a SUOXgene locus and disease status in the presence of high tungsten and arsenic levels warrants further investigation.

Considering the county population and statewide cancer rate, fewer than two cases would be expected. OBJECTIVES: In March 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention led federal, state, and local agencies in a cross-sectional, case-comparison study to determine if ongoing environmental exposures posed a health risk to residents and to compare levels of contaminants in environmental and biologic samples collected from participating families. METHODS: Surveys with more than 500 variables were administered to 205 people in 69 families. Blood, urine, and cheek cell samples were collected and analyzed for 139 chemicals, eight viral markers, and several genetic polymorphisms. Air, water, soil, and dust samples were collected from almost 80 homes to measure more than 200 chemicals. RESULTS: The scope of this cancer cluster investigation exceeded any previous study of pediatric leukemia. Nonetheless, no exposure consistent with leukemia risk was identified. Overall, tungsten and arsenic levels in urine and water samples were significantly higher than national comparison values; however, levels were similar among case and comparison groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although the cases in this cancer cluster may in fact have a common etiology, their small number and the length of time between diagnosis and our exposure assessment lessen the ability to find an association between leukemia and environmental exposures. Given the limitations of individual cancer cluster investigations, it may prove more efficient to pool laboratory and questionnaire data from similar leukemia clusters.","['Rubin, Carol S', 'Holmes, Adrianne K', 'Belson, Martin G', 'Jones, Robert L', 'Flanders, W Dana', 'Kieszak, Stephanie M', 'Osterloh, John', 'Luber, George E', 'Blount, Benjamin C', 'Barr, Dana B', 'Steinberg, Karen K', 'Satten, Glen A', 'McGeehin, Michael A', 'Todd, Randall L']","['Rubin CS', 'Holmes AK', 'Belson MG', 'Jones RL', 'Flanders WD', 'Kieszak SM', 'Osterloh J', 'Luber GE', 'Blount BC', 'Barr DB', 'Steinberg KK', 'Satten GA', 'McGeehin MA', 'Todd RL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC1797848,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Jan;115(1):151-7. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9022.,"['0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Metals)', '0 (Pesticides)', 'DFC2HB4I0K (Polychlorinated Biphenyls)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*analysis', 'Environmental Pollutants/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Metals/analysis', 'Nevada/epidemiology', 'Pesticides/analysis', 'Polychlorinated Biphenyls/analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Risk Factors', 'Water Supply/analysis']",['10.1289/ehp.9022 [doi]'],,"['National Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30341, USA. crubin@cdc.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lines of investigation test hypotheses that cALL is a rarer result of common infection, that it results from uncommon infection, or that it ensues from abnormal immune development; perhaps it requires a preceding prenatal or early childhood insult. Ideally, studies should document that particular infections precede leukemiA and induce malignant transformation. However, limited detection studies have not directly linked specific human or nonhuman infectious agents with ALL or cALL. Primarily based on surrogate markers of infectious exposure, indirect evidence from ecologic and epidemiologic studies varies widely, but some suggest that infancy or early childhood infectious exposures might protect against childhood ALL or cALL. Several others suggest that maternal infection during pregnancy might increase risk or that certain breast-feeding practices decrease risk. To date, evidence cannot confirm or refute whether at least one infection induces or is a major co-factor for developing ALL or cALL, or perhaps actually protects against disease. Differences in methodology and populations studied may explain some inconsistencies. Other challenges to proof include the likely time lag between infection and diagnosis, the ubiquity of many infections, the influence of age at infection, and the limitations in laboratory assays; small numbers of cases, inaccurate background leukemia rates, and difficulty tracking mobile populations further affect duster investigations. Nevertheless, existing evidence partially supports plausibility and warrants further investigation into potential infectious determinants of ALL and cALL, particularly in the context of multifactorial or complex systems.","[""O'Connor, Siobhan M"", 'Boneva, Roumiana S']","[""O'Connor SM"", 'Boneva RS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC1817664,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Jan;115(1):146-50. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9024.,,IM,,"['Child', 'Communicable Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology']",['10.1289/ehp.9024 [doi]'],,"['National Center for Infectious Diseases and National Center for HIV, STD and TB Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia 30333, USA. sbo5@cdc.gov']",,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,

It accounts for 30% of all cancers diagnosed in children younger than 15 years. Within this population, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) occurs approximately five times more frequently than acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and accounts for approximately 78% of all childhood leukemia diagnoses. Epidemiologic studies of acute leukemias in children have examined possible risk factors, including genetic, infectious, and environmental, in an attempt to determine etiology. Only one environmental risk factor (ionizing radiation) has been significantly linked to ALL or AML. Most environmental risk factors have been found to be weakly and inconsistently associated with either form of acute childhood leukemia. Our review focuses on the demographics of childhood leukemia and the risk factors that have been associated with the development of childhood ALL or AML. The environmental risk factors discussed include ionizing radiation, non-ionizing radiation, hydrocarbons, pesticides, alcohol use, cigarette smoking, and illicit drug use. Knowledge of these particular risk factors can be used to support measures to reduce potentially harmful exposures and decrease the risk of disease. We also review genetic and infectious risk factors and other variables, including maternal reproductive history and birth characteristics.","['Belson, Martin', 'Kingsley, Beverely', 'Holmes, Adrianne']","['Belson M', 'Kingsley B', 'Holmes A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,PMC1817663,2007/03/21 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/03/21 09:00'],"['2007/03/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/21 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Jan;115(1):138-45. doi: 10.1289/ehp.9023.,,IM,,"['Child', 'Communicable Diseases/complications', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",['10.1289/ehp.9023 [doi]'],,"['Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Environmental Health, Division of Environmental Hazards and Health Effects, Health Studies Branch, Atlanta, Georgia 30341, USA. mbelson@cdc.gov']",,,,145,"['Environ Health Perspect. 2007 Aug;115(8):A395-6.

Herein, we report that gnidilatimonoein induces differentiation and apoptosis in KG1, NB4 and U937 cells. The drug inhibited growth and proliferation of KG1, NB4 and U937 cells with IC50 values of 1.5, 1.5 and 1.0 microM, respectively, after 72 h of treatment. Cell viability was also decreased by 18%, 20% and 23%, respectively, after 72 h treatment with the drug. NBT reducing assay revealed that the inhibition of proliferation is associated with differentiation especially toward monocytes-like morphology. Indeed, the drug at 0.5-1.5 microM induced differentiation by 5-50% in the cells. Acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) double staining and DNA fragmentation assays revealed that apoptosis occurred after differentiation of the cells.

PROCEDURE: (1) State incidence rates were compared to Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) rates for each year and for the 5-year period, 1996-2000; (2) incidence rates for each of Ohio's 88 counties were compared to statewide rates; and (3) county incidence rates were compared based on population density, population growth, and rural/urban locale. SEER*Stat version 5.0 was used to derive age-specific and 0-19 age-adjusted rates. Expected values, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), and Poisson P-values were calculated with Excel using the indirect method of standardization. RESULTS: Of the 585 cases, 73.3% were acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 16.6% acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), 3.2% acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL), and 2.6% chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Rates for total leukemia burden were significantly below national levels for all races (P = 0.00001), likely due to poor ascertainment of cases. Yearly incidence rates for 1996-2000 were stable for ALL and AML; CML rates declined over the period. Based on 2000 Census and intercensal population estimates for 1996-2000, statistically higher rates for ALL were noted for counties experiencing >10% population change 1990-2000 (P < 0.05), especially for ages 1-4 (P < 0.03) in counties with 10-20% growth. Counties 67.9-99.2% urban experienced fewer than expected cases of AML + AMoL (P < 0.06).

Treatment of cells at an intermediate sanguinarine concentration (6.25 microg/ml) induced diffuse swelling or oncosis-diffuse cell swelling (DCS). To assess the underlying mechanism of sanguinarine-induced apoptosis and oncosis-BCD in K562 cells, we studied their response to pre-treatment with two chemical compounds: aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) and cycloheximide (CHX). The pretreatment effects of both chemical compounds on apoptosis and oncosis-BCD were evaluated by measuring multiple parameters using quantitative morphology, electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) end-labeling and annexin-V-binding. ATA, a DNA endonuclease inhibitor, efficiently prevented DNA nicking and inhibited apoptosis almost completely and oncosis-BCD by about 40%, while CHX, a protein synthesis inhibitor, failed to inhibit both apoptosis and oncosis-BCD. These results demonstrate, first, the importance of endonuclease in sanguinarine-induced apoptosis and to some extent in oncosis-BCD and, second, that this inhibition does not require de novo protein synthesis.","['Hallock, Sarathi', 'Tang, Shou-Ching', 'Buja, L Maximilian', 'Trump, Benjamin F', 'Liepins, Andrejs', 'Weerasinghe, Priya']","['Hallock S', 'Tang SC', 'Buja LM', 'Trump BF', 'Liepins A', 'Weerasinghe P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Toxicol Pathol,Toxicologic pathology,7905907,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Pathol. 2007 Feb;35(2):300-9. doi: 10.1080/01926230701194211.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '4431-00-9 (Aurintricarboxylic Acid)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'AV9VK043SS (sanguinarine)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)']",IM,,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Aurintricarboxylic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Benzophenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology']","['772663027 [pii]', '10.1080/01926230701194211 [doi]']",,"[""Faculty of Medicine, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, A1B 3V6, Canada.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the authors used nude mice and examined the therapeutic role of p53 gene for erythroleukemia in vivo in the absence of MHC effects. METHODS: The nude mice were injected with murine erythroleukemia cells (MEL), MEL cells transfected with wild-type p53 gene (MEL-W), and MEL cells transfected with mutated p53 gene (MEL-M). Abnormalities were found in the hemorheological and biophysical properties of red blood cells in all 3 groups of animals, but the abnormalities were lesser in degree and later in appearance in MEL-W group than in MEL and MEL-M groups. Furthermore, the nude mice in MEL-W group lived longer than those in MEL and MEL-M groups. RESULTS: The results showed that WTp53 restrained the growth of erythroleukemia cells in vivo and reduced the erythroleukemia tumorigenesis in the microcirculation by improving the hemorheological and biophysical properties of MEL cells, which helped to prolong the life span of nude mice suffering from erythroleukemia.

Imatinib blocks proliferation and induces apoptosis of BCR-ABL-expression in CML. Many side effects produced by imatinib have been documented but its induction of hepatotoxcity has been rarely reported. Only a few cases so far have been reported in the literature and almost all were in females. We describe another case of hepatotoxicity due to imatinib in a 17-year old female with clinical, laboratory and histopathological changes.

The aim of this study was to determine the IC50 of cytotoxic drugs (cytosine arabinoside, ara-C and daunorubicin, dnr) using the in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetra zolium, inner salt (MTS) assay method. A total of 82 newly diagnosed acute leukemia cases (43 adult myeloid leukaemia, AML cases and 39 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, ALL cases) and 16 relapsed cases (8 AML cases and 8 ALL cases) were studied. The MTS assay was performed using two cytotoxic drugs, dnr and ara-C. Cells were incubated with different concentrations of drugs for 4 days and the IC50 was extrapolated from the viability curve. In newly diagnosed cases, we found that childhood ALL samples showed higher IC50 values of dnr (0.040 +/- 2.320) compared to adult AML samples (0.021 +/- 0.158). In contrast, newly diagnosed adult AML samples showed higher IC50 values of ara-C (0.157 +/- 0.529) compared to childhood ALL samples (0.100 +/- 2.350). In relapsed cases, two samples of childhood ALL showed IC50 values of dnr (0.910 +/- 1.760) and ara-C (1.310 +/- 2.390), which was higher compared to childhood AML samples (0.129 +/- 0.214 and 0.210 +/- 0.003, respectively). However, there was no correlation between IC50 values of these drugs tested with clinical outcome. In conclusion, we found that MTS assay is an easy, rapid and non laborious method to study in vitro drug resistance in acute leukaemia cases.","['Fazlina, N', 'Maha, A', 'Jamal, R', 'Zarina, A L', 'Cheong, S K', 'Hamidah, H', 'Ainoon, O', 'Zulkifli, S Z', 'Hamidah, N H']","['Fazlina N', 'Maha A', 'Jamal R', 'Zarina AL', 'Cheong SK', 'Hamidah H', 'Ainoon O', 'Zulkifli SZ', 'Hamidah NH']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2007 Feb;12(1):33-7. doi: 10.1080/10245330600940030.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '138169-43-4', '(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet', 'razolium)', '299-11-6 (Methylphenazonium Methosulfate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Coloring Agents/analysis', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylphenazonium Methosulfate/pharmacology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Tetrazolium Salts/analysis', 'Thiazoles/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/ultrastructure']","['772840637 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330600940030 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether these results are due to the biologic recruitment of cell cycle-specific agents is unknown. However, this strategy to intensify induction may lead to more profound myelosuppression and to potential toxicities.

Basopholic intracytoplasmic viral matrix inclusions (MIs) were widely distributed in the chickens affected with subcutaneous myxoma rhabdomyosarcoma, perineuroma, glioma, intra-abdominal adenocarcinoma, and nephroblastoma. MIs were observed in the myocardial cells and the impulse-conducting-system cells. They were also present in the smooth muscle cells of the arteries in the spleen and lungs, in the smooth muscle of the digestive tract muscular layer (crop, oesophagus, proventriculus, gizzard, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum, and large intestine), and in the smooth muscle of the capsule in the ovary and pancreas. They were also observed in the podocytes of glomeruli and renal epithelium in the kidneys, tumour cells of nephroblastoma, chondrocytes of the trachea, squamous-epithelial cells of the pharynx, and nerve cells of the cerebrum and tumour cells of the glioma in the cerebellum. Histochemically, MIs were stained with RNA, but not with DNA. MIs in the various tissues were strongly positive for the avian leukosis virus (ALV) antigen. Ultrastracturally, MIs were found in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells and podocytes of renal glomeruli. They consisted of electron-dense small granules and ring-shaped particles. Viral particles were observed in the vesicles of the cytoplasm of myocardial cells and glomerular podocytes. The gene product specific for subgroup A of ALV was detected in the livers or tumours by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This result suggests that MIs can be formed in organs rather than muscular systems in the chickens naturally affected with ALV-associated tumours.","['Nakamura, Kikuyasu', 'Higashi, Tomoko', 'Yamada, Manabu', 'Imai, Kunitoshi', 'Yamamoto, Yu']","['Nakamura K', 'Higashi T', 'Yamada M', 'Imai K', 'Yamamoto Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Avian Pathol,Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,8210638,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Avian Pathol. 2007 Feb;36(1):53-8. doi: 10.1080/03079450601110007.,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*isolation & purification', 'Chickens/*virology', 'Chondrocytes/cytology/virology', 'Female', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*virology', 'Podocytes/ultrastructure', 'Poultry Diseases/*pathology/*virology', 'Subcutaneous Tissue/pathology']","['770903740 [pii]', '10.1080/03079450601110007 [doi]']",,"['National Institute of Animal Health.

The most conspicuous symptoms of the disease were induced by ALV subgroup C; however, significant differences in the occurrence of wasting disease were found among individual members of this subgroup. Almost comparable pathogenicity was exhibited by ALV subgroup D, whereas viruses of subgroups B and A proved to be moderately and almost non-pathogenic, respectively. Using antibodies to cellular antigens, tissue alterations were shown clearly in ALV-C-infected chickens. An essential feature was depletion of lymphocytes in the thymus, bursa and spleen. While the number of dendritic cells in the bursa was increased, their representation in the thymus and spleen was reduced. In the spleen, however, the reduction of dendritic cells concerned only an ellipsoid compartment, which in itself was also markedly reduced. An increased number of macrophages in the thymus and spleen corresponded with the observed general activation of the monocyte-macrophage system. In the spleen, CD4+ T cells were reduced while CD8+ T cells were increased.

Maximal tolerable chemoradiotherapy doses are given as part of the conditioning-regimen. This treatment causes substantial toxicity, and the procedure is therefore restricted to patients younger than 60 years without co-morbidity. Non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT, is a treatment modality that can be offered to patients up to 70 years of age and to younger patients with co-morbidity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 patients (17 men and 4 women) with different haematological malignancies, have been treated with non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT in our institution from October 2000 to May 2005. RESULTS: The transplant procedure was relatively non-toxic. Four patients required transfusions and 3 required empirical antibiotic treatment, which is always necessary after myoablavative allogen SCT. A stable donor chimerism was achieved for most of our patients before day 84. 11 patients suffered from acute graft versus host disease (GVHD), 6 with debut of symptoms after day 100. 11 patients developed chronic GVHD. 14 patients are alive and 7 are dead; 2 due to transplant-related complications and 5 due to disease progression. INTERPRETATION: We have shown that non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT is feasible with an acceptable toxicity. Acute and chronic GVHD is still a substantial problem. Prospective studies with adequate controls are warranted to determine the future role of non-myeloablative allogeneic SCT.","['Dalgaard, Jakob', 'Floisand, Yngvar', 'Stenersen, Margurethe', 'Egeland, Torstein', 'Brinch, Lorentz']","['Dalgaard J', 'Floisand Y', 'Stenersen M', 'Egeland T', 'Brinch L']",['nor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Norway,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen,"Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",0413423,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/03/31 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tidsskr Nor Laegeforen. 2007 Mar 15;127(6):721-4.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",['1501668 [pii]'],,"['Seksjon for blodsykdommer, Medisinsk avdeling, Rikshospitalet-Radiumhospitalet, 0027 Oslo. jakob.dalgaard@sb-hf.no']",,Allogen stamcelletransplantasjon med redusert forbehandling.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activates NF-kappaB by stimulating the activity of IkappaB kinase (IKK), but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that Tax functions as an intracellular stimulator of an IKK-activating kinase, Tak1 (TGF-beta-activating kinase 1). In addition, Tax physically interacts with Tak1 and mediates the recruitment of IKK to Tak1. In HTLV-I-infected T cells, Tak1 is constitutively activated and complexed with both Tax and IKK. We provide genetic evidence that Tak1 is essential for Tax-induced IKK activation. Furthermore, unlike cellular stimuli, the Tax-specific NF-kappaB signalling does not require the ubiquitin-binding function of IKKgamma. These findings show a pathological mechanism of IKK activation by Tax and provide an example for how IKK is persistently activated in cancer cells.","['Wu, Xuefeng', 'Sun, Shao-Cong']","['Wu X', 'Sun SC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,EMBO Rep,EMBO reports,100963049,PMC1866198,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/11/09 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2006/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/09 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO Rep. 2007 May;8(5):510-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.embor.7400931.

Downstream pathways that transmit pro-oncogenic signals are not well characterized. To identify these pathways, protein microarrays were used to profile the phosphorylation state of 108 epitopes on 82 distinct signaling proteins in a panel of 13 T-cell leukemia cell lines treated with a gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) to inhibit Notch signals. The microarray screen detected GSI-induced hypophosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins in the mTOR pathway. This effect was rescued by expression of the intracellular domain of Notch and mimicked by dominant negative MAML1, confirming Notch specificity. Withdrawal of Notch signals prevented stimulation of the mTOR pathway by mitogenic factors. These findings collectively suggest that the mTOR pathway is positively regulated by Notch in T-ALL cells. The effect of GSI on the mTOR pathway was independent of changes in phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and Akt activity, but was rescued by expression of c-Myc, a direct transcriptional target of Notch, implicating c-Myc as an intermediary between Notch and mTOR. T-ALL cell growth was suppressed in a highly synergistic manner by simultaneous treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and GSI, which represents a rational drug combination for treating this aggressive human malignancy.","['Chan, Steven M', 'Weng, Andrew P', 'Tibshirani, Robert', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Utz, Paul J']","['Chan SM', 'Weng AP', 'Tibshirani R', 'Aster JC', 'Utz PJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1896117,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):278-86. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-039883.

The histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) is being evaluated for imatinib-resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and has multiple cellular effects, including the induction of autophagy and apoptosis. Considering that autophagy may promote cancer cell survival, we hypothesized that disrupting autophagy would augment the anticancer activity of SAHA. Here we report that drugs that disrupt the autophagy pathway dramatically augment the antineoplastic effects of SAHA in CML cell lines and primary CML cells expressing wild-type and imatinib-resistant mutant forms of Bcr-Abl, including T315I. This regimen has selectivity for malignant cells and its efficacy was not diminished by impairing p53 function, another contributing factor in imatinib resistance. Disrupting autophagy by chloroquine treatment enhances SAHA-induced superoxide generation, triggers relocalization and marked increases in the lysosomal protease cathepsin D, and reduces the expression of the cathepsin-D substrate thioredoxin. Finally, knockdown of cathepsin D diminishes the potency of this combination, demonstrating its role as a mediator of this therapeutic response. Our data suggest that, when combined with HDAC inhibitors, agents that disrupt autophagy are a promising new strategy to treat imatinib-refractory patients who fail conventional therapy.","['Carew, Jennifer S', 'Nawrocki, Steffan T', 'Kahue, Charissa N', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Yang, Chunying', 'Chung, Linda', 'Houghton, Janet A', 'Huang, Peng', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Cleveland, John L']","['Carew JS', 'Nawrocki ST', 'Kahue CN', 'Zhang H', 'Yang C', 'Chung L', 'Houghton JA', 'Huang P', 'Giles FJ', 'Cleveland JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1896119,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):313-22. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-10-050260.

In comparison to wild-type mice, Dok-3(-/-) mice mounted significantly enhanced humoral immune responses to T cell-independent type I and II antigens. Dok-3-deficient B cells hyperproliferated, exhibited elevated level of calcium signaling as well as enhanced activation of NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38MAPK in response to B-cell receptor (BCR) engagement. In the absence of Dok-3, the localization of the inhibitory phosphatase SHIP-1 to the plasma membrane is intact while its phosphorylation is compromised, suggesting that Dok-3 could function to facilitate or sustain the activation of SHIP-1.

Microsatellite analysis in a female patient showed that mitotic recombination was not responsible for the transition from JAK2-V617F-positive MPD to JAK2-V617F-negative AML, and clonality determined by the MPP1 polymorphism demonstrated that the granulocytes and leukemic blasts inactivated the same parental X chromosome. In a second patient positive for JAK2-V617F at transformation, but with JAK2-V617F-negative leukemic blasts, we found del(11q) in all cells examined, suggesting a common clonal origin of MPD and AML.

The mechanistic events by which KIT/PDGFRA kinase inhibition leads to clinical responses in GIST patients are not known in detail. We report here that imatinib triggers GIST cell apoptosis in part through the up-regulation of soluble histone H2AX, a core histone H2A variant. We found that untreated GIST cells down-regulate H2AX in a pathway that involves KIT, phosphoinositide-3-kinase, and the ubiquitin/proteasome machinery, and that the imatinib-mediated H2AX up-regulation correlates with imatinib sensitivity. Depletion of H2AX attenuated the apoptotic response of GIST cells to imatinib. Soluble H2AX was found to sensitize GIST cells to apoptosis by aberrant chromatin aggregation and a transcriptional block. Our results underscore the importance of H2AX as a human tumor suppressor protein, provide mechanistic insights into imatinib-induced tumor cell apoptosis and establish H2AX as a novel target in cancer therapy.","['Liu, Ying', 'Tseng, Michelle', 'Perdreau, Sophie A', 'Rossi, Ferdinand', 'Antonescu, Cristina', 'Besmer, Peter', 'Fletcher, Jonathan A', 'Duensing, Stefan', 'Duensing, Anette']","['Liu Y', 'Tseng M', 'Perdreau SA', 'Rossi F', 'Antonescu C', 'Besmer P', 'Fletcher JA', 'Duensing S', 'Duensing A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 15;67(6):2685-92. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3497.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (H2AX protein, human)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histones/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation']","['67/6/2685 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3497 [doi]']",,"['Molecular Virology Program, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A CpG island (CGI) microarray containing more than 3,400 unique clones that span all human chromosomes was used for large-scale discovery experiments and led to 262 unique CGI loci being statistically identified as methylated in ALL lymphoblasts. The methylation status of 10 clones encompassing 11 genes (DCC, DLC-1, DDX51, KCNK2, LRP1B, NKX6-1, NOPE, PCDHGA12, RPIB9, ABCB1, and SLC2A14) identified as differentially methylated between ALL patients and controls was independently verified. Consequently, the methylation status of DDX51 was found to differentiate patients with B- and T-ALL subtypes (P = 0.011, Fisher's exact test). Next, the relationship between methylation and expression of these genes was examined in ALL cell lines (NALM-6 and Jurkat) before and after treatments with 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A. More than a 10-fold increase in mRNA expression was observed for two previously identified tumor suppressor genes (DLC-1 and DCC) and also for RPIB9 and PCDHGA12. Although the mechanisms that lead to the CGI methylation of these genes are unknown, bisulfite sequencing of the promoter of RPIB9 suggests that expression is inhibited by methylation within SP1 and AP2 transcription factor binding motifs. Finally, specific chromosomal methylation hotspots were found to be associated with ALL. This study sets the stage for acquiring a better biological understanding of ALL and for the identification of epigenetic biomarkers useful for differential diagnosis, therapeutic monitoring, and the detection of leukemic relapse.","['Taylor, Kristen H', 'Pena-Hernandez, Keila E', 'Davis, J Wade', 'Arthur, Gerald L', 'Duff, Deiter J', 'Shi, Huidong', 'Rahmatpanah, Farah B', 'Sjahputera, Ozy', 'Caldwell, Charles W']","['Taylor KH', 'Pena-Hernandez KE', 'Davis JW', 'Arthur GL', 'Duff DJ', 'Shi H', 'Rahmatpanah FB', 'Sjahputera O', 'Caldwell CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 15;67(6):2617-25. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3993.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RUNDC3B protein, human)']",IM,,"['Carrier Proteins/genetics', '*CpG Islands', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']","['67/6/2617 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3993 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathology and Anatomical Sciences, Ellis Fischel Cancer Center, University of Missouri-Columbia School of Medicine, Columbia, Missouri 65212, USA.']","['CA097880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'LM07089/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These include gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), mastocytosis, acute myelogenous leukemia, and germ cell tumors. The kinase inhibitor imatinib potently inhibits c-KIT and is approved for treatment of GIST. However, secondary point mutations can develop within the kinase domain to confer resistance to imatinib and cause drug-resistant relapse. A common mutation, which results in a V654A substitution, has been documented in imatinib-resistant GIST patients. We expressed c-KIT cDNA constructs encoding the V654A substitution alone and in combination with a typical activating exon 11 mutation characteristic of GIST, V560G, in factor-dependent FDC-P1 cells. The V654A substitution alone resulted in enhanced proliferation in c-KIT ligand (stem cell factor) but not factor independence. Cells expressing the double mutant were, like those expressing single V560G mutant c-KIT, factor independent. Analysis of cellular proliferation in the presence of imatinib showed that the V654A substitution alone conferred resistance. The difference in sensitivity was especially pronounced for cells expressing single mutant V560G c-KIT compared with double mutant V560G/V654A c-KIT. The findings were supported by studies of c-KIT phosphorylation. Analysis of the crystal structure of imatinib in complex with the kinase domain of c-KIT predicts that the V654A substitution directly affects the binding of imatinib to the receptor. Alternative c-KIT inhibitors, nilotinib (AMN107) and PKC412, were also less active on V560G/V654A c-KIT than on the V560G single mutant; however, nilotinib, like imatinib, potently inhibited the V560G mutant. PKC412 strongly inhibited imatinib-resistant D816V c-KIT.","['Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Odell, Adam F', 'Byrnes, Ellen M', 'Baleato, Rosa M', 'Griffith, Renate', 'Lyons, Alan Bruce', 'Ashman, Leonie K']","['Roberts KG', 'Odell AF', 'Byrnes EM', 'Baleato RM', 'Griffith R', 'Lyons AB', 'Ashman LK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Mar;6(3):1159-66. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0641.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Mice', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']","['6/3/1159 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0641 [doi]']",,"['University of Newcastle, Room 511, Medical Sciences Building, Callaghan, New South Wales 2308, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that emodin significantly induces cytotoxicity in the human myeloma cells through the elimination of myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1). Emodin inhibited interleukin-6-induced activation of Janus-activated kinase 2 (JAK2) and phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), followed by the decreased expression of Mcl-1. Activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was triggered by emodin, but the expression of other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, except Mcl-1, did not change in the presence of emodin. To clarify the importance of Mcl-1 in emodin-induced apoptosis, the Mcl-1 expression vector was introduced into the human myeloma cells by electroporation. Induction of apoptosis by emodin was almost abrogated in Mcl-1-overexpressing myeloma cells as the same level as in parental cells, which were not treated with emodin. In conclusion, emodin inhibits interleukin-6-induced JAK2/STAT3 pathway selectively and induces apoptosis in myeloma cells via down-regulation of Mcl-1, which is a good target for treating myeloma. Taken together, our results show emodin as a new potent anticancer agent for the treatment of multiple myeloma patients.","['Muto, Akihiro', 'Hori, Mayumi', 'Sasaki, Yosuke', 'Saitoh, Akari', 'Yasuda, Iho', 'Maekawa, Tadahito', 'Uchida, Tomoe', 'Asakura, Keiko', 'Nakazato, Tomonori', 'Kaneda, Toshio', 'Kizaki, Masahiro', 'Ikeda, Yasuo', 'Yoshida, Tadashi']","['Muto A', 'Hori M', 'Sasaki Y', 'Saitoh A', 'Yasuda I', 'Maekawa T', 'Uchida T', 'Asakura K', 'Nakazato T', 'Kaneda T', 'Kizaki M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Yoshida T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Mar;6(3):987-94. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0605.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'KA46RNI6HN (Emodin)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Emodin/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']","['6/3/987 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0605 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Hoshi University, 2-4-41 Ebara, Shinagawaku, Tokyo 142-8501, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have selected a panel of human tumor cell lines and xenografts to allow determination of selectivity and efficacy of P276-00. When tested against a panel of 16 cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cell lines, the antiproliferative potential of P276-00 was found to be approximately 30-fold higher than cisplatin. Studies to show tumor sensitivity using clonogenic assay in 22 human xenografts indicated that P276-00 was approximately 26-fold more potent than cisplatin, and further, it was also found to be active against cisplatin-resistant tumors of central nervous system, melanoma, prostate, and renal cancers. Further, we studied the effects of P276-00 on cell cycle progression by flow cytometry using asynchronous and synchronous population of tumor and normal cells. Asynchronous population of human prostate carcinoma (PC-3) and human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells when exposed to P276-00 showed arrest of slow-growing PC-3 cells in G(2)-M with no significant apoptosis observed up to 72 h. Unlike PC-3, significant apoptosis was seen in fast-growing HL-60 cells at 6 h. However, synchronized human non-small cell lung carcinoma (H-460) and human normal lung fibroblast (WI-38) cells showed arrest of cells in G(1). H-460 cells undergo apoptosis, which increases with longer exposure to the compound and also after exposure to P276-00 for 48 h followed by recovery. In contrast, the normal cells (WI-38) remain arrested in G(1) with no significant apoptosis up to 72 h of exposure and also after 48 h of P276-00 treatment followed by recovery, confirming our previous results that P276-00 was less effective against normal cells compared with cancer cells. After promising in vitro results, P276-00 was checked for in vivo efficacy in murine tumor and human xenograft models. Growth inhibition of murine colon cancer (CA-51) was significant when P276-00 was administered i.p. at 50 mg/kg daily for 20 treatments. However, in murine lung carcinoma model (Lewis lung), an increased dose of 60 mg/kg (30 mg/kg twice daily) administered every alternate day i.p. for seven treatments showed significant inhibition in the growth. Further studies were undertaken to establish the efficacy profile of P276-00 in human tumor xenograft models. In the two xenograft models studied, P276-00 showed potent in vivo antitumor potential. Compound P276-00 at a dose of 35 mg/kg administered daily via the i.p. route for 10 days showed significant (P < 0.05) inhibition in the growth of human colon carcinoma HCT-116 xenograft. Furthermore, P276-00 at a dose of 50 mg/kg once daily and 30 mg/kg twice daily administered via i.p. route for 20 treatments significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited growth of human non-small cell lung carcinoma H-460 xenograft. Thus, the in vitro cellular potency, together with in vivo antitumor activity, confirms the potential of P276-00, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor as an anticancer molecule.","['Joshi, Kalpana S', 'Rathos, Maggie J', 'Mahajan, Pravin', 'Wagh, Vilas', 'Shenoy, Satyendra', 'Bhatia, Dimple', 'Chile, Shailaja', 'Sivakumar, Meenakshi', 'Maier, Armin', 'Fiebig, Heinz-Herbert', 'Sharma, Somesh']","['Joshi KS', 'Rathos MJ', 'Mahajan P', 'Wagh V', 'Shenoy S', 'Bhatia D', 'Chile S', 'Sivakumar M', 'Maier A', 'Fiebig HH', 'Sharma S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Mar;6(3):926-34. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0614.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (P276-00)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/therapeutic use', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G2 Phase/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']","['6/3/926 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0614 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Nicholas Piramal Research Center, Nicholas Piramal India Ltd., 1-Nirlon Complex, Goregaon (East), Mumbai 400 063, India. kjoshi@nicholaspiramal.co.in']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on antitumor activity in animal models, a variety of Cdk inhibitors are undergoing clinical evaluation either as a single agent or in combination with other approved drugs. In our anticancer drug discovery program, a novel series of flavones have been synthesized for evaluation against the activity of Cdk4-D1. This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, thus inhibiting its function. We have identified a series of potent Cdk4-D1 inhibitors with IC(50) below 250 nmol/L. In this report, we have described the properties of one of the best compound, P276-00 of the flavone's series. P276-00 shows 40-fold selectivity toward Cdk4-D1, compared with Cdk2-E. The specificity toward 14 other related and unrelated kinases was also determined. P276-00 was found to be more selective with IC(50)s <100 nmol/L for Cdk4-D1, Cdk1-B, and Cdk9-T1, as compared with other Cdks, and less selective for non-Cdk kinases. It showed potent antiproliferative effects against various human cancer cell lines, with an IC(50) ranging from 300 to 800 nmol/L and was further compared for its antiproliferative activity against cancer and normal fibroblast cell lines. P276-00 was found to be highly selective for cancer cells as compared with normal fibroblast cells. To delineate its mechanism of action, the effect of P276-00 on cell cycle proteins was studied in human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) and human non-small cell lung carcinoma (H-460). A significant down-regulation of cyclin D1 and Cdk4 and a decrease in Cdk4-specific pRb Ser(780) phosphorylation was observed. P276-00 produced potent inhibition of Cdk4-D1 activity that was found to be competitive with ATP and not with retinoblastoma protein. The compound also induced apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells, as evidenced by the induction of caspase-3 and DNA ladder studies. These data suggest that P276-00 has the potential to be developed as an anti-Cdk chemotherapeutic agent.","['Joshi, Kalpana S', 'Rathos, Maggie J', 'Joshi, Rajendra D', 'Sivakumar, Meenakshi', 'Mascarenhas, Malcolm', 'Kamble, Shrikant', 'Lal, Bansi', 'Sharma, Somesh']","['Joshi KS', 'Rathos MJ', 'Joshi RD', 'Sivakumar M', 'Mascarenhas M', 'Kamble S', 'Lal B', 'Sharma S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Mar;6(3):918-25. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0613.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavones)', '0 (P276-00)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Flavones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism']","['6/3/918 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-06-0613 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Nicholas Piramal Research Center, Nicholas Piramal India Limited, 1-Nirlon Complex, Goregaon (E), Mumbai 400 063, India. kjoshi@nicholaspiramal.co.in']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using DIMSCAN, a fluorescence digital image system for quantifying relative cell numbers in tissue culture plates, we have developed a 96-well cytotoxicity assay with a >4-log dynamic range. METHODS: To overcome background fluorescence that limits detection of viable cells with fluorescein diacetate, we used 2'4'5'6'-tetrabromofluorescein (eosin Y) to quench background fluorescence in the medium and in nonviable cells to enhance the reduction of background fluorescence achieved with digital image thresholding. The sensitivity and linearity of the new assay were tested with serial dilutions of neuroblastoma and leukemia cell lines. DIMSCAN was compared with other in vitro cytotoxicity assays: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, colony formation, and trypan blue dye exclusion. RESULTS: Without background fluorescence reduction, scans produced a nearly flat curve across various cell concentrations from 100 to 10(6) cells per well. Either digital image thresholding or eosin Y dramatically reduced background fluorescence, and combining them achieved a linear correlation (r > 0.9) of relative fluorescence to viable cell number over >4 logs of dynamic range, even in the presence of 4 x 10(4) nonviable cells per well. Cytotoxicity of deferoxamine for neuroblastoma cell lines measured by the DIMSCAN assay achieved dose-response curves similar to data obtained by manual trypan blue counts or colony formation in soft agar but with a wider dynamic range. Long-term cultures documented the clonogenic ability of viable cells detected by DIMSCAN over the entire dynamic range. The cytotoxicity of two drug combinations (buthionine sulfoximine + melphalan or fenretinide + safingol) was tested using both DIMSCAN and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays, and the wider dynamic range of DIMSCAN facilitated detection of synergistic interactions. CONCLUSION: DIMSCAN offers the ability to rapidly and efficiently conduct cytotoxicity assays in 96-well plates with a dynamic range of >4 logs. This assay enables rapid testing of anticancer drug combinations in microplates.","['Frgala, Tomas', 'Kalous, Ondrej', 'Proffitt, Robert T', 'Reynolds, C Patrick']","['Frgala T', 'Kalous O', 'Proffitt RT', 'Reynolds CP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,,2007/03/17 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2007 Mar;6(3):886-97. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0331.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '187EJ7QEXL (Fenretinide)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)', 'OWA98U788S (safingol)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'TDQ283MPCW (Eosine Yellowish-(YS))']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Eosine Yellowish-(YS)/pharmacology', 'Fenretinide/administration & dosage', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sphingosine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']","['6/3/886 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-04-0331 [doi]']",,"[""Developmental Therapeutics Program, USC-CHLA Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, MS#57, 4650 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]","['CA 81403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 82830/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here on apoptosis induced by staurosporine in NB-2a neuroblastoma cells, which was accompanied by excision of chromatin loop domains, but proceeded without internucleosomal DNA cleavage. In contrast to apoptosis associated with internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, the apoptotic pathway associated with excision of chromatin loop domains was largely caspase independent. We identify here MAPK family member, p38/JNK, mitochondria, and topoisomerase II as the components of this caspase-independent apoptotic pathway. While caspase-independent excision of chromatin loop domains was a predominant mechanism of DNA disintegration in staurosporine-treated neuroblastoma, both caspase-dependent internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-independent excision of chromatin loop domains accompanied staurosporine-induced apoptosis of promyelocytic leukemia cells.

METHODS: Hepatic cell lines QSG-7701 and HepG2 were transfected with plasmid PUC18-HBV 1.2 by standard calcium phosphate precipitation method, and 1.0 microg pSEAP2-control vector was included in the transfection procedures to serve as an internal control monitoring the transfection efficiency. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) in the medium was detected by ELISA method and HBV DNA was quantitated using fluorescent quantitative PCR. The intracellular HBsAg and HBcAg were detected with immunofluorescent staining. The gene expression profiles of QSG-7701 and HepG2 were compared using oligonucleotide microarray; partial differentially expressed genes were verified with quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: In the medium of the cultured HepG2 cells, HBsAg and HBV DNA could be detected 6 days after the transfection, whereas in QSG-7701 cells, the HBsAg and HBV DNA could be detected for 2 weeks. The HBV DNA in the culture medium of QSG-7701 was about 50 times more than that of the HepG2 cells which were kept in 1 x 10(7)copies/ml(-3) x 10(7)copies/ml for 0 to 10 days after the transfection. On the 4th day after the transfection, 20% to 30% of the QSG-7701 cells were positive with HBsAg and HBcAg immunofluorescent staining. The gene microarray analysis showed that most transcription factors involved with HBV life cycle in QSG-7701 and HepG2 cells had similar levels, whereas some factors involved with HBV transcriptional regulation and core particle disassembly, such as interleukin-6 (R=5.1340), retinoid X receptor, alpha (R=5.1268), hepatic leukemia factor (R=3.2538), serine protease PRRS23 (R=2.8356), hepatitis B virus x interacting protein (R=0.4939), serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (R=0.0740) and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (negative in QSG-7701) were all differentially expressed by HepG2 cells. CONCLUSION: Different than HepG2 cells, the QSG-7701 cells could support a high level and relatively stable HBV replication after HBV DNA transient transfection. The HBV core particles were probably recycled in the QSG-7701 cells. The differential gene expressions between QSG-7701 and HepG2 might explain the mechanism of the different HBV replication patterns. Hepatic cell line QSG-7701 might serve as a useful tool for HBV transcriptional regulation research.","['Pan, Xiao-ben', 'Zhu, Lin', 'Gao, Yan', 'Chen, Hong-Song', 'Wei, Lai']","['Pan XB', 'Zhu L', 'Gao Y', 'Chen HS', 'Wei L']",['chi'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,9710009,,2007/03/17 09:00,2010/07/07 06:00,['2007/03/17 09:00'],"['2007/03/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/07 06:00 [medline]', '2007/03/17 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Gan Zang Bing Za Zhi. 2007 Feb;15(2):83-7.,,IM,,"['Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Genome, Viral', 'Hep G2 Cells', 'Hepatitis B virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Virus Replication']",,,"[""People's Hospital, Hepatology Institute, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we aim to present a retrospective study conducted over a 5-year period (2001-2005). The study included 20 patients with haematologic malignancies with a proven mucormycosis admitted in Medical Oncology Divisions in Cukurova University Hospital. The most frequent sites of infection were paranasal sinuses (95%) and lung (5%). Antifungal treatment was empirically administered in 18 (90%) patients; 18 patients underwent radical surgical debridement (90%). The therapy was successful for only eight patients (40%). Eleven patients died within 1 months of the diagnosis of fungal infection: the cause of death was only by mucormycosis in four patients (36.6%), mucormucosis and systematic inflamatuar response syndrome (SIRS) in two patients (18.2%) and progression of haematologic disease in five patients (45.5%). At univariate analysis, the factors that correlated with a positive outcome from infection were the following: amphotericin B treatment, neutrophil recovery from postchemotherapy aplasia. At multivariate analysis, the factors that significantly correlated with recovery from infection were the liposomal amphotericin B treatment (p = 0.026), doses of L-AmB (p = 0.008) and the length of the treatment (p = 0.01), respectively. It seems to have increased in recent years. Although a reduction of mortality has been observed recently, the mortality rate still remains high.

Thus novel therapeutic strategies and agents are urgently needed to treat these incurable cancers. Oleanolic acid and ursolic acid are naturally occurring triterpenoids that have been used in traditional Asian medicine as anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer agents. Recently, synthetic oleanolic acid triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dioxooleana-1,9(11)-dien-28-oic acid (CDDO) and its C-28 methyl ester (CDDO-Me) and C-28 imidazole (CDDO-Im) derivatives have been shown to exhibit potent antitumor activity against diverse types of tumor cell lines, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, osteosarcoma, breast, lung, and pancreatic cancer cell lines; however, the anticancer activity of these agents for brain tumors has not been reported. In the present study, we investigated the apoptosis-inducing activity of CDDOs in glioblastoma (U87MG, U251MG) and neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) cell lines. Cell growth/viability (MTS) and cytotoxicity (LDH release) assays demonstrated that glioblastoma cell lines are least sensitive to CDDO, but are highly sensitive to CDDO-Me and CDDO-Im at concentrations of 2.5-10 muM. CDDO-Im and CDDO-Me were equipotenent in their growth inhibitory activity. The primary mode of tumor cell destruction was apoptosis as demonstrated by significant increase in the number of hypo-diploid (sub-G0) cells and annexin V-FITC binding. Induction of apoptosis was associated with the activation of procaspases-3, -8, and -9, mitochondrial depolarization and the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. Furthermore, CDDO-Me inhibited the levels of anti-apoptotic and prosurvival p-Akt, NF-kappaB (p65) and Notch1 signaling molecules.

Analysis of 728 paired blood and marrow samples demonstrated high concordance (87%) for patients off-therapy. Blood analysis was equally or more sensitive than marrow in 92% of samples but marrow analysis was necessary to detect MRD within 3 months of alemtuzumab therapy. Assessment of 50 CLL-specific antibody combinations identified three (CD5/CD19 with CD20/CD38, CD81/CD22 and CD79b/CD43) with low inter-laboratory variation and false-detection rates. Experienced operators demonstrated an accuracy of 95.7% (specificity 98.8%, sensitivity 91.1%) in 141 samples with 0.01-0.1% CLL. There was close correlation and 95% concordance with RQ-ASO IgH-PCR for detection of CLL above 0.01%. The proposed flow cytometry approach is applicable to all sample types and therapeutic regimes, and sufficiently rapid and sensitive to guide therapy to an MRD-negativity in real time.

However, this view is not in keeping with the frequent finding of wild-type, full-length WT1 in human leukemia, breast cancer and several other cancers including the majority of Wilms' tumors. Rather, these observations suggest that in those conditions, WT1 has an oncogenic role in tumor formation.

Genotype frequency indicated that the most frequently found gene content was eight genes in controls and 14 in patients (P<0.05). The KIR genotype analysis revealed that patient and, surprisingly, control KIR genotypes preferentially consisted of type B haplotypes characterized by the presence of multiple-activating KIRs. Evidence was also provided that the same KIR genotype was shared by a variable number of patients. Interestingly, the recurrent genotypes observed in the patient group were not found in controls. Concerning inhibitory genes, KIR2DL5a and 2DL5b were more frequently detected in patients than in controls (P<0.01), likely representing a discrete feature of the genetic repertoire of the patients. KIR gene repertoire analysis in patients suggests that the susceptibility to NK-LDGL might be related to the presence of activating KIR genes and supports the concept that these receptors may be involved in the priming of granular lymphocytes (GL) proliferation. Population analysis might disclose a genetic background predisposing to this disease.","['Scquizzato, E', 'Teramo, A', 'Miorin, M', 'Facco, M', 'Piazza, F', 'Noventa, F', 'Trentin, L', 'Agostini, C', 'Zambello, R', 'Semenzato, G']","['Scquizzato E', 'Teramo A', 'Miorin M', 'Facco M', 'Piazza F', 'Noventa F', 'Trentin L', 'Agostini C', 'Zambello R', 'Semenzato G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):1060-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404634.

Two transcripts of LMO2 gene (LMO2-a and LMO2-b) have been reported to encode a same 158-amino-acid protein. We have previously reported a novel transcript of human LMO2 gene (LMO2-c) encoding a 151-amino-acid protein, and defined its promoter region. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of the LMO2-c expression and the functions of LMO2-c. We found that LMO2-c expression is regulated by the cooperation of two essential hematopoietic transcription factors GATA-1 and PU.1 in various hematopoietic cell lines, suggesting an important functional role for LMO2-c in the hematopoietic system. More importantly, we demonstrated that LMO2-c acts as an antagonist of LMO2-a/b binding to its partners, therefore blocking the transactivation of LMO2-a/b on its target genes. These findings provide novel evidence to the functions of LMO2 gene in the hematopoietic system and leukemia.","['Wang, Q', 'Zhang, M', 'Wang, X', 'Yuan, W', 'Chen, D', 'Royer-Pokora, B', 'Zhu, T']","['Wang Q', 'Zhang M', 'Wang X', 'Yuan W', 'Chen D', 'Royer-Pokora B', 'Zhu T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2676384,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):1015-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404644.

Altered PU.1 function is possibly implicated in leukemogenesis, as PU.1 gene mutations were identified in some patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and as several oncogenic products (AML1-ETO, promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha, FMS-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication) are associated with PU.1 downregulation. To demonstrate directly a role of PU.1 in the blocked differentiation of leukemic blasts, we transduced cells from myeloid cell lines and primary blasts from AML patients with a lentivector encoding PU.1. In NB4 cells we obtained increases in PU.1 mRNA and protein, comparable to increases obtained with all-trans retinoic acid-stimulation. Transduced cells showed increased myelomonocytic surface antigen expression, decreased proliferation rates and increased apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in primary AML blasts from 12 patients. These phenotypic changes are characteristic of restored blast differentiation. PU.1 should therefore constitute an interesting target for therapeutic intervention in AML.","['Durual, S', 'Rideau, A', 'Ruault-Jungblut, S', 'Cossali, D', 'Beris, P', 'Piguet, V', 'Matthes, T']","['Durual S', 'Rideau A', 'Ruault-Jungblut S', 'Cossali D', 'Beris P', 'Piguet V', 'Matthes T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):1050-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404645.

CML stem-cell compartment is dynamic as it progresses to terminal blast crisis where myeloid and lymphoid blasts fail to differentiate. We demonstrate cross-regulation of signaling network involving Sonic hedgehog (Shh), Wnt, Notch and Hox for the inexorable blastic transformation of CD34(+) CML cells. Significant upregulation in Patched1, Frizzled2, Lef1, CyclinD1, p21 (P < or =0.0002) and downregulation of HoxA10 and HoxB4 (P< or =0.0001) transcripts in CD34(+) cells distinguish blast crisis from chronic CML. We report Shh-dependent Stat3 activation orchestrates these mutually interconnected signaling pathways. Stimulation of CD34(+) CML cells with either soluble Shh or Wnt3a did not activate Akt or p44/42-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Interestingly, unlike dominant negative Stat3beta, introduction of constitutive active Stat3 in CD34(+) CML cells induces cross-regulation in gene expression. Additionally, Shh and Wnt3a-dependent regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKI) in CML suggests their role in the network. Taken together, our findings propose that deregulation in the form of hyperactive Shh and Wnt with repressed Notch and Hox pathways involving Stat3, Gli3, beta-catenin, CyclinD1, Hes1, HoxA10 and p21 might act synergistically to form an important hub in CML progression.","['Sengupta, A', 'Banerjee, D', 'Chandra, S', 'Banerji, S K', 'Ghosh, R', 'Roy, R', 'Banerjee, S']","['Sengupta A', 'Banerjee D', 'Chandra S', 'Banerji SK', 'Ghosh R', 'Roy R', 'Banerjee S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):949-55. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404657.

The exact mechanism leading to failure in apoptotic pathways during CML progression is unclear. In view of the central role of p53 and apaf1 in the apoptotic machinery we examined six human paired chronic and BC phases samples for their expression. Real-time PCR (RQ-PCR) experiments showed an elevation of p53 mRNA in all patients during transition to BC. However, elevation of apaf1 during BC was observed in five patients only. In contrast, one patient displayed a significant 11.5-fold reduction of apaf1 expression during the transition to BC. No apaf1 promoter methylation was observed. The reduced apaf1 expression was accompanied by a trans-dominant point mutation (H179R) in one p53 allele and the loss of the other. This mutant p53, when tested using functionality assays, was unable to activate apaf1, consequently explaining the reduced expression observed in this patient. Furthermore, the same mutant failed to activate either genes involved in apoptotic or cell cycle arrest pathways, and can be considered as a complete loss of function mutation. This specific mutation was reported in several types of cancer, but was not implicated in CML. To conclude, in this study we have demonstrated mRNA elevation of p53 and apaf1 during CML blast crisis, indicating that genes and proteins involved in cellular apoptosis might be involved in disease progression/response to therapy. Moreover, the mutated p53 discovered in the patient exhibiting lowered apaf1 expression provides, in a clinical case, the first correlation between p53 and apaf1 transcription regulation in humans.","['Ashur-Fabian, Osnat', 'Adamsky, Konstantin', 'Trakhtenbrot, Luba', 'Cohen, Yoram', 'Raanani, Pia', 'Hardan, Izhar', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Amariglio, Ninette']","['Ashur-Fabian O', 'Adamsky K', 'Trakhtenbrot L', 'Cohen Y', 'Raanani P', 'Hardan I', 'Nagler A', 'Rechavi G', 'Amariglio N']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Mar 1;6(5):589-94. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.5.3900.

To identify novel activated tyrosine kinases in AML, we used a discovery platform consisting of immunoaffinity profiling coupled to mass spectrometry that identifies large numbers of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including active kinases. This method revealed the presence of an activated colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) kinase in the acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) cell line MKPL-1. Further studies using siRNA and a small-molecule inhibitor showed that CSF1R is essential for the growth and survival of MKPL-1 cells. DNA sequence analysis of cDNA generated by 5'RACE from CSF1R coding sequences identified a novel fusion of the RNA binding motif 6 (RBM6) gene to CSF1R gene generated presumably by a t(3;5)(p21;q33) translocation. Expression of the RBM6-CSF1R fusion protein conferred interleukin-3 (IL-3)-independent growth in BaF3 cells, and induces a myeloid proliferative disease (MPD) with features of megakaryoblastic leukemia in a murine transplant model.

Furthermore, the position of the LMO2 breakpoints in T-ALL in the light of the occurrence of TCRD-LMO2 translocations in normal thymocytes points to a critical role for the exact breakpoint location in determining LMO2 activation levels and the consequent pressure for T-ALL development.","['Dik, Willem A', 'Nadel, Bertrand', 'Przybylski, Grzegorz K', 'Asnafi, Vahid', 'Grabarczyk, Piotr', 'Navarro, Jean Marc', 'Verhaaf, Brenda', 'Schmidt, Christian A', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth A', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Langerak, Anton W']","['Dik WA', 'Nadel B', 'Przybylski GK', 'Asnafi V', 'Grabarczyk P', 'Navarro JM', 'Verhaaf B', 'Schmidt CA', 'Macintyre EA', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Langerak AW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):388-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-064816.

E2F1, a transcription factor regulating BMI1, was up-regulated in CML compared with controls (P = .001). In a cohort of 64 CML patients, the level of BMI1 at diagnosis correlated with time to transformation to blast crisis, and the combination of low BMI1 and high proteinase-3 expression was associated in multivariate analysis with an improved overall survival (P = .001).

Deregulation of this Akt signaling pathway underlies various human neoplastic diseases. Recently, the proto-oncogene TCL1 (T cell leukemia 1), with a previously unknown physiological function, was shown to interact with the Akt pleckstrin homology domain, enhancing Akt kinase activity; hence, it functions as an Akt kinase coactivator. In contrast to pathological conditions in which the TCL1 gene is highly activated in various human neoplasmic diseases, the physiological expression of TCL1 is tightly limited to early developmental cells as well as various developmental stages of immune cells. The NBRE (nerve growth factor-responsive element) of the proximal TCL1 promoter sequences can regulate the restricted physiological expression of TCL1 in a negative feedback mechanism. Further, based on the NMR structural studies of Akt-TCL1 protein complexes, an inhibitory peptide, ""Akt-in,"" consisting of the betaA strand of TCL1, has been identified and has therapeutic potential. This review article summarizes and discusses recent advances in the understanding of TCL1-Akt functional interaction in order to clarify the biological action of the proto-oncogene TCL1 family and the development avenues for a suppressive drug specific for Akt, a core intracellular survival regulator.","['Noguchi, Masayuki', 'Ropars, Virginie', 'Roumestand, Christian', 'Suizu, Futoshi']","['Noguchi M', 'Ropars V', 'Roumestand C', 'Suizu F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2007 Aug;21(10):2273-84. doi: 10.1096/fj.06-7684com.

To develop a better animal model for the investigation of HTLV-1 infection, we established a transgenic (Tg) rat carrying the human CRM1 (hCRM1) gene, which encodes a viral RNA transporter that is a species-specific restriction factor. At first we found that CRM1 expression is elaborately regulated through a pathway involving protein kinase C during lymphocyte activation, initially by posttranscriptional and subsequently by transcriptional mechanisms. This fact led us to use an hCRM1-containing bacterial artificial chromosome clone, which would harbor the entire regulatory and coding regions of the CRM1 gene. The Tg rats expressed hCRM1 protein in a manner similar to expression of intrinsic rat CRM1 in various organs. HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines derived from these Tg rats produced 100- to 10,000-fold more HTLV-1 than did T cells from wild-type rats, and the absolute levels of HTLV-1 were similar to those produced by human T cells. We also observed enhancement of the dissemination of HTLV-1 to the thymus in the Tg rats after intraperitoneal inoculation, although the proviral loads were low in both wild-type and Tg rats.

Here we document that both Np9 and Rec physically and functionally interact with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) tumor suppressor, a transcriptional repressor and chromatin remodeler implicated in cancer and the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells. Interaction is mediated via two different central and C-terminal domains of Np9 and Rec and the C-terminal zinc fingers of PLZF. One major target of PLZF is the c-myc proto-oncogene. Coexpression of Np9 and Rec with PLZF abrogates the transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene promoter by PLZF and results in c-Myc overproduction, altered expression of c-Myc-regulated genes, and corresponding effects on cell proliferation and survival. Thus, the human endogenous retrovirus proteins Np9 and Rec may act oncogenically by derepressing c-myc through the inhibition of PLZF.","['Denne, Miriam', 'Sauter, Marlies', 'Armbruester, Vivienne', 'Licht, Jonathan D', 'Roemer, Klaus', 'Mueller-Lantzsch, Nikolaus']","['Denne M', 'Sauter M', 'Armbruester V', 'Licht JD', 'Roemer K', 'Mueller-Lantzsch N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,PMC1900259,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/07/13 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/13 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2007 Jun;81(11):5607-16. doi: 10.1128/JVI.02771-06.

The molecular mechanisms underlying modulation of self-renewal and differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) under such hypoxic conditions remain to be established. Here, we show that hypoxia inhibits mESC self-renewal and induces early differentiation in vitro, even in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). These effects are mediated by down-regulation of the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway. Under conditions of hypoxia, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) suppresses transcription of LIF-specific receptor (LIFR) by directly binding to the reverse hypoxia-responsive element located in the LIFR promoter. Ectopic expression and small interference RNA knockdown of HIF-1alpha verified the inhibitory effect on LIFR transcription.

We found that cyanidin-3-rutinoside extracted and purified from the black raspberry cultivar Jewel induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Paradoxically, this compound induced the accumulation of peroxides, which are involved in the induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In addition, cyanidin-3-rutinoside treatment resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent activation of p38 MAPK and JNK, which contributed to cell death by activating the mitochondrial pathway mediated by Bim. Down-regulation of Bim or overexpression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-x(L) considerably blocked apoptosis.

However, even though imatinib successfully controls the leukemia in chronic phase, it seems not to be able to cure the disease, potentially necessitating lifelong treatment with the inhibitor under constant risk of relapse. On a molecular level, the cause of disease persistence is not well understood. Initial studies implied that innate features of primitive progenitor cancer stem cells may be responsible for the phenomenon. Here, we describe an assay using retroviral insertional mutagenesis (RIM) to identify genes contributing to disease persistence in vivo. We transplanted mice with bone marrow cells retrovirally infected with the Bcr-Abl oncogene and subsequently treated the animals with imatinib to select for leukemic cells in which the proviral integration had affected genes modulating the imatinib response. Southern blot analysis demonstrated clonal outgrowth of cells carrying similar integration sites. Candidate genes located near the proviral insertion sites were identified, among them the transcription factor RUNX3. Proviral integration near the RUNX3 promoter induced RUNX3 expression, and Bcr-Abl-positive cell lines with stable or inducible expression of RUNX1 or RUNX3 were protected from imatinib-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, imatinib treatment selected for RUNX1-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo after infection of primary bone marrow cells with Bcr-Abl and RUNX1.

Overexpression of SUMO-1 has been associated with alterations in apoptosis, but the underlying mechanisms and their relevance for human diseases are not clear. Here, we show that the increased expression of SUMO-1 in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synovial fibroblasts (SFs) contributes to the resistance of these cells against Fas-induced apoptosis through increased SUMOylation of nuclear PML protein and increased recruitment of the transcriptional repressor DAXX to PML NBs. We also show that the nuclear SUMO-protease SENP1, which is found at lower levels in RA SFs, can revert the apoptosis-inhibiting effects of SUMO-1 by releasing DAXX from PML NBs. Our findings indicate that in RA SFs overexpression of SENP1 can alter the SUMO-1-mediated recruitment of DAXX to PML NBs, thus influencing the proapoptotic effects of DAXX. Accumulation of DAXX in PML NBs by SUMO-1 may, therefore, contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders.","['Meinecke, Ingmar', 'Cinski, Antje', 'Baier, Anja', 'Peters, Marvin A', 'Dankbar, Berno', 'Wille, Aline', 'Drynda, Andreas', 'Mendoza, Heidi', 'Gay, Renate E', 'Hay, Ronald T', 'Ink, Barbara', 'Gay, Steffen', 'Pap, Thomas']","['Meinecke I', 'Cinski A', 'Baier A', 'Peters MA', 'Dankbar B', 'Wille A', 'Drynda A', 'Mendoza H', 'Gay RE', 'Hay RT', 'Ink B', 'Gay S', 'Pap T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,PMC1829266,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2007 Mar 20;104(12):5073-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0608773104.

The intervention was successfully implemented 85.4% of the scheduled times. We used two different statistical methods to analyze the longitudinal data. Using an ANOVA model, sleep was significantly more efficient in the experimental arm than in the control arm when daily differences from baseline sleep efficiency values were averaged and compared (F=4.17, P=0.053). However, in a mixed model (repeated measures) analysis, sleep duration (F=0.54, P=0.47) and sleep efficiency (F=0.04, P=0.85) were not seen to differ between study arms.

In this study, a lentiviral vector containing two promoters achieved consistent and efficient co-expression of FLT3/ITD and GFP in transduced human CD34(+) haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). When cultured in medium containing stem cell factor, thrombopoietin and FLT3 ligand (FL), FLT3/ITD-transduced cells demonstrated enhanced self-renewal and survival potential, unaffected by the withdrawal of FL. These cells retained a CD34(+)CD38(-/dim) immunophenotype, typical of HSPCs. Compared to cells transduced with a vector expressing GFP alone, FLT3/ITD-transduced HSPCs had a higher fraction of cells in active cell cycle. FLT3/ITD-transduced HSPCs were more sensitive to the induction of cytotoxicity by CEP-701, a selective FLT3 inhibitor, indicating a rapid 'addiction' to signalling through this oncogenic pathway. The FLT3/ITD-transduced HSPCs showed increased expression of Pim-1, c-Myc and Cyclin D3 (CCND3), each of which may contribute to the altered genetic programme instituted by FLT3/ITD signalling. Taken together, these results indicate that FLT3/ITD mutations may contribute to leukaemic transformation of normal HSPCs by prolonging survival, promoting proliferation and partially blocking differentiation. CEP-701 may act as a potent therapeutic agent for AML stem cells harbouring FLT3/ITD mutations.","['Li, Li', 'Piloto, Obdulio', 'Kim, Kyu-Tae', 'Ye, Zhaohui', 'Nguyen, Ho Bao', 'Yu, Xiaobing', 'Levis, Mark', 'Cheng, Linzhao', 'Small, Donald']","['Li L', 'Piloto O', 'Kim KT', 'Ye Z', 'Nguyen HB', 'Yu X', 'Levis M', 'Cheng L', 'Small D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/11/06 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Apr;137(1):64-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06525.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Indoles)', 'DO989GC5D1 (lestaurtinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Carbazoles/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclins/genetics', 'Furans', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, myc', 'HIV-1/genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods', 'Transfection/methods', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics/*physiology']","['BJH6525 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2007.06525.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']","['CA70970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To expand upon previous transplacental carcinogenesis assays performed in CD-1 mice, the transplacental carcinogenicity of AZT was evaluated in a second mouse strain and a second rodent species. Date-mated female mice and rats were gavaged daily with 0, 80, 240, or 480 mg AZT/kg bw during the last 7 days of gestation. At 2 years postpartum, male and female B6C3F1 mouse and F344 rat offspring (n = 44-46 of each sex and species/treatment group) were necropsied for gross and microscopic tissue examinations. Under the conditions of these two-year studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity based upon significant dose-related trends and increases in the incidences of hemangiosarcoma in male mice and mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity in the livers of male mice based upon a positive trend and an increased incidence of hepatic carcinoma in the high-dose AZT group.

Although many studies have focused on MeHg-induced neurological disorders, the association between MeHg and malignant neoplasms has not been adequately investigated. Therefore, we explored this association using the age standardized mortality ratio (ASMR) in an ecologic study over a wide area allowing for a long empirical induction period. METHODS: The subjects were residents in areas around the Shiranui Sea. We divided these areas into exposure groups 1 (Minamata and Ashikita regions) and 2 (Amakusa region). Exposure group 1 was contaminated from the late 1930s, and exposure group 2 was contaminated from the late 1950s. In addition, exposure group 1 was contaminated more heavily than exposure group 2. There were 92,525 and 152,541 residents in each group in 1960, respectively. We analyzed the cancer ASMR in both exposure groups using data from two reference populations (Japan and Kumamoto prefecture) from 1961 to 1997. There were 94,301,494 and 1,856,192 people in each reference group in 1960, respectively. We abstracted population and mortality data from the censuses and the vital statistics of the prefecture and Japan. RESULTS: An increased leukemia ASMR and a decreased gastric cancer ASMR were observed in both exposure groups, while other ASMRs were around unity and less precise. Furthermore, the leukemia ASMRs were elevated differently between the two exposure groups: the leukemia ASMR was already elevated early in the study period in exposure group 1 and increased gradually in exposure group 2. CONCLUSIONS: While the negative association between MeHg and gastric cancer might be explained by salt intake, the positive association between MeHg and leukemia could not be explained by potential confounders. Despite some limitations mainly due to its ecologic design, this study indicates the necessity of an individual-level study evaluating the association between MeHg and leukemia in regions with exposure to MeHg.","['Yorifuji, Takashi', 'Tsuda, Toshihide', 'Kawakami, Norito']","['Yorifuji T', 'Tsuda T', 'Kawakami N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/11/07 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2007 Aug;80(8):679-88. doi: 10.1007/s00420-007-0179-y.

Our results showed that the treatment with aspirin inhibited the growth of Jurkat cell line. Jurkat cells treated with 3 mmol/L of aspirin could significantly decrease nuclear localization of beta-catenin, and at 5 mmol/L of aspirin, the nuclear localization of beta-catenin was undetectable. QRT-PCR showed that the target gene cyclin D1 mRNA expression was gradually decreased with the dosage of aspirin. Aspirin induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in Jurkat cells. We are led to conclude that aspirin acts through beta-catenin-independent mechanisms.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Radiation-induced apoptosis was determined in U937 monocytic leukaemia cells exposed to energy inhibitors post-irradiation. Apoptosis was scored microscopically using morphological criteria. Glycolysis was determined by assessing glucose consumption and lactate production. Adenine nucleotide levels were measured using a luciferase assay after enzymatic conversion to ATP. Respiration was measured using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. RESULTS: In addition to their apoptosis-inducing properties, both 2DG and azide modified post-irradiation apoptosis. 2DG induced apoptotic radiosensitization after exposure to lower concentrations (5 mM, 10 mM) up to 20 h post-irradiation while a level of radioprotection was found after 5 h exposure to higher doses up to 100 mM. By contrast, all doses of azide examined (5-50 mM) induced apoptotic radioprotection at all times examined. Glycolytic flux and ATP levels fell rapidly with increasing 2DG dose but energy charge remained unchanged. Glycolysis was less influenced by azide, with ATP levels being initially maintained after exposure but decreasing in a dose-dependent manner at 3 h post-irradiation. However, energy charge was unaffected by azide at the concentrations examined. CONCLUSIONS: Both 2DG and azide can influence radiation-induced apoptosis possibly through their effects on glycolysis and ATP levels. We suggest that modulation of energy metabolism provides mechanistic insight into radiation-induced apoptotic pathways.","['Hunter, A J', 'Hendrikse, A S', 'Renan, M J']","['Hunter AJ', 'Hendrikse AS', 'Renan MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2007 Feb;83(2):105-14. doi: 10.1080/09553000601121157.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)', '9G2MP84A8W (Deoxyglucose)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Deoxyglucose/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', '*Radiation', 'Sodium Azide/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells/drug effects/radiation effects']",['10.1080/09553000601121157 [doi]'],,"['Division of Radiation Oncology, Department of Radiation Medicine, University of Cape Town/Groote Schuur Hospital, Observatory, South Africa.

Signal transduction molecules such as tyrosine kinases play important roles in CaP. Src, a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (NRTK) and the first proto-oncogene discovered is shown to participate in processes such as cell proliferation and migration in CaP. Underscoring NRTK's and, specifically, Src's importance in cancer is the recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of dasatinib, the first commercial Src inhibitor for clinical use in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). In this review we will focus on NRTKs and their roles in the biology of CaP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Publicly available literature from PubMed regarding the topic of members of NRTKs in CaP was searched and reviewed. RESULTS: Src, FAK, JaK1/2, and ETK are involved in processes indispensable to the biology of CaP: cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Src emerges as a common signaling and regulatory molecule in multiple biological processes in CaP. Src's relative importance in particular stages of CaP, however, required further definition. Continued investigation of NRTKs will increase our understanding of their biological function and potential role as new therapeutic targets.","['Chang, Yu-Ming', 'Kung, Hsing-Jien', 'Evans, Christopher P']","['Chang YM', 'Kung HJ', 'Evans CP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,PMC1813931,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neoplasia. 2007 Feb;9(2):90-100. doi: 10.1593/neo.06694.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor/enzymology/pathology', 'Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/classification/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Signal Transduction', 'src-Family Kinases/analysis/physiology']",['10.1593/neo.06694 [doi]'],,"['Department of Urology, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA 95817, USA.']",,,,121,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The carboplatin analogues cis-1,2-propylendiammine (cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylato) platinum (II) (MD2), and cis-izobutylendiammine (cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylato)platinum (II) (MD3) were characterized by elemental analysis and (1)H-NMR-measurements. The compounds were tested for antiproliferative activity against the following human tumor cell lines: myelogenous leukemia K562, colon adenocarcinoma HT- 29, breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7, and human lung fetal fibroplast cell line MRC-5. The active substance of carboplatin (MD1) was used as reference compound. Cells were exposed to complexes for 24 h at concentrations ranging from 10(-3) to 10(-8)M. Growth inhibition was evaluated by the colorimetric SRB assay. The IC(50) value of each carboplatin compound was determined by median effects analysis. RESULTS: Both carboplatin analogues induced dose-dependent growth inhibition of human tumor cell lines after 24 h of treatment. The MD3 analogue was 60-fold and the MD2 was 2-foild more active against K562 cell line compared to the referent compound. The activity of both analogues was comparable to the refernt compound against MCF-7 cell line. Colon adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29 was found to be 4-fold less sensitive to MD2 but equally sensitive to MD3 with respect to carboplatin referent compound.

It is expressed in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) through the mature B cell stage. Using genetically engineered mice in which the endogenous Ikaros gene is disrupted, it has been shown that a lack of Ikaros leads to a block in B cell development and that its severe diminution results in a hyperresponsive B cell compartment. Ikaros expression within the HSC has led to speculation as to whether the role of Ikaros in B cell biology is largely accomplished prior to B cell specification. In addition, widespread expression of Ikaros in hematopoietic cells leads to the possibility that some or all of the observed defects are not B cell autonomous. In this report, we demonstrate that over-expression of a dominant interfering Ikaros isoform exclusively in B cells has profound effects on mature B cell function. We provide evidence that continued high-level expression of Ikaros is essential for homeostasis of peripheral lymphocytes and maintenance of B cell tolerance. We also show that deregulation of Ikaros activity does not rapidly result in B cell leukemogenesis as it does with 100% penetrance within the T cell lineage.","['Wojcik, Heather', 'Griffiths, Erin', 'Staggs, Sarah', 'Hagman, James', 'Winandy, Susan']","['Wojcik H', 'Griffiths E', 'Staggs S', 'Hagman J', 'Winandy S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/05/26 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2007 Apr;37(4):1022-32. doi: 10.1002/eji.200637026.,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoantibodies/*biosynthesis', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Protein Binding/genetics/immunology', 'Protein Isoforms/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology']",['10.1002/eji.200637026 [doi]'],,"['Department of Microbiology-Immunology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike HIV infection, most patients infected with HTLV-1 remain asymptomatic throughout their lifetime. CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 39-year-old Afro-Caribbean man with HTLV-1 infection presenting as hypercalcemia and granulomatous pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. RESULTS: Interestingly, the hypercalcemia presented with normal parathyroid hormone-related protein and low 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D levels, and the presence of pneumocystis jiroveci in the granulomas was diagnosed with transbronchial biopsy taken during bronchoscopy. HTLV-1-associated adult T cell leukemia lymphoma (ATLL) was diagnosed in this patient by bone marrow and lymph node biopsy. CONCLUSION: Increased bone resorption, likely cytokine-mediated, is the most likely mechanism of hypercalcemia in this patient.

We aimed to identify a serum marker that may help to stratify febrile neutropenic pediatric patients treated for hematologic malignancies at the time of first evaluation. Thus, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and monocyte chemotactic protein-1-alpha (MCP-1-alpha) were evaluated for their predictive and diagnostic relevance in febrile episodes of cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within 24 hours of fever, CRP, IL-8, and MCP-1 serum levels were measured and the levels of these markers were related to the clinical findings of the patients. For this purpose, we collected and analyzed clinical data of 85 fever episodes occurring in 76 patients with hematologic malignancies, presenting to the Department of Pediatric Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, during a 6-month period. RESULTS: Neutropenic children with febrile episodes were classified into 2 groups, a group with unexplainable fever (group I, n=26) and another group with either blood culture positive, and/or fever periods with a documented clinical sepsis and/or local infection (group II, n=59). Clinically, local sites of infection were encountered in 39 cases (45.9%), whereas a positive blood culture was detected in 20 cases. CRP, IL-8, and MCP-1 levels were significantly lower in group I versus group II (P value <0.001). There were overlaps of values between groups. CRP > or =90 mg/L was significantly associated with chemotherapy-related neutropenia and fever owing to bacteremia (P=0.038). The sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of CRP, MCP-1, and IL-8 were (70%, 73%, 51%, and 85%), (64%, 92%, 53%, and 95%), and (71%, 77%, 54%, and 88%), respectively. Combining 2 or 3 markers improved the diagnostic performance of these test, as 78% of group II had elevated 2 or 3 markers versus 16% of the group with no evident infection. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of CRP, MCP-1, and IL-8 could identify patients with unexplainable fever; whereas, high levels of these markers were of help in the diagnosis of infectious episodes. A model combining more than 1 marker is recommended in the assessment of febrile neutropenia.","['El-Maghraby, Shereen Mohamed', 'Moneer, Manar Mohamed', 'Ismail, Manar Mohamed', 'Shalaby, Lobna M', 'El-Mahallawy, Hadir Ahmed']","['El-Maghraby SM', 'Moneer MM', 'Ismail MM', 'Shalaby LM', 'El-Mahallawy HA']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2007 Mar;29(3):131-6. doi: 10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180308770.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacteremia/blood/drug therapy/microbiology', 'C-Reactive Protein/*analysis', 'Chemokine CCL2/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fever/diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-8/*blood', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3180308770 [doi]', '00043426-200703000-00001 [pii]']",,"['Clinical Pathology Department, Epidemiology and Biostastics Department, Pediatric Oncology Department, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt. shereenmaghraby36@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the majority of patients who came to our observation in Brazil have low or normal body weight and only one of them was obese. Therefore, we have decided to assess some biochemical parameters possibly related to the intermediate metabolism and body composition in these patients. METHODS: Two groups of subjects were studied: 27 survivors of childhood ALL (14.0 +/- 4.2 years old; post-treatment interval 8.6 +/- 3.9 years) (ALL group) and 17 healthy subjects (12.8 +/- 4 years old) (control group) selected on the basis of their kinship with the patients. RESULTS: 14/27 patients of the ALL group and 4/17 of the control group had leptin levels higher than the normal range for age and sex (p < 0.05). The leptin level was significantly higher in the ALL group (15.5 +/- 1.8 ng/ml) than in the control group (10.7 +/- 2 ng/ml) (p < 0.05). When adjusted by sex, BMI z-score, and age, the level of leptin in patients of the ALL group was 8.5 higher than in subjects of the control group (p = 0.006). Leptin/insulin correlation in the ALL group was 0.08 and in the control group it was +0.585 (p < 0.05).

Standard treatment for resected and locally advanced disease usually consists of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, either bolus or continuous infusion) and external beam radiation. However, recent studies have shown the role of gemcitabine either used alone or incorporated with 5-FU and external beam radiation in this setting. Gemcitabine and erlotinib (Tarceva) are currently the only standard chemotherapeutic agents approved by FDA for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Combination chemotherapy trials incorporating gemcitabine with other agents such as 5-FU, oxaliplatin, or capecitabine generally show improved outcomes in objective response rates but with little or no improvement in survival in phase III trials.

This difference in cell aggregation suggests different surface properties which could be visualised by decreased staining of L1210/VCR cell surface coat (glycocalyx) with a polycationic dye ruthenium red. A decrease in surface to volume ratio as a consequence of increased cell size in resistant cells is compensated by proliferation of villi and cytoplasmic protrusions of the cell surface. L1210/VCR cells were further distinguished by higher amount of euchromatin, increase in density of rough endoplasmic reticulum, more developed Golgi apparatus and aggregation of free ribosomes into tetrameric and pentameric polyribosomes. These structural changes may be interpreted as a sign of increase in proteosynthesis and transport of substances.","['Uhrik, B', 'El-Saggan, A H', 'Seres, M', 'Gibalova, L', 'Breier, A', 'Sulova, Z']","['Uhrik B', 'El-Saggan AH', 'Seres M', 'Gibalova L', 'Breier A', 'Sulova Z']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2006 Dec;25(4):427-38.,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell Size', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Leukemia L1210/*classification/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice']",,,"['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, 833 34 Bratislava 37, Slovakia. branislav.uhrik@savba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe effects of NPI-0052, a novel proteasome inhibitor, in leukemia model systems. In cell lines, NPI-0052 inhibits all 3 proteolytic activities associated with the proteasome: chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and caspase-like. NPI-0052 also induces DNA fragmentation in leukemia lines and in mononuclear cells from a Ph + acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patient. Caspase-3 activation by NPI-0052 was seen in wild-type Jurkat cells, but was significantly lessened in Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-deficient or caspase-8-deficient counterparts. NPI-0052-induced apoptosis was further probed using caspase-8 inhibitors, which were more protective than caspase-9 inhibitors. N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) also conferred protection against NPI-0052-induced apoptosis, indicating a role for oxidative stress by NPI-0052. In support of the drug's in vitro activities, biweekly treatment with NPI-0052 lessened total white blood cell (WBC) burden over 35 days in leukemic mice. Interestingly, combining NPI-0052 with either MS-275 or valproic acid (VPA) induced greater levels of cell death than the combination of bortezomib with these histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi). These effects of NPI-0052, alone and in combination with HDACi, warrant further testing to determine the compound's clinical efficacy in leukemia.","['Miller, Claudia P', 'Ban, Kechen', 'Dujka, Melanie E', 'McConkey, David J', 'Munsell, Mark', 'Palladino, Michael', 'Chandra, Joya']","['Miller CP', 'Ban K', 'Dujka ME', 'McConkey DJ', 'Munsell M', 'Palladino M', 'Chandra J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1896116,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):267-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-03-013128.

We investigated how embryonic stem cells (ESCs) convert leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) concentration into an all-or-nothing cell-fate decision (self-renewal). Using a combined experimental/computational approach we demonstrate unexpected switch-like (on/off) signaling in response to LIF. This behavior emerges over time due to a positive feedback loop controlling transcriptional expression of LIF signaling pathway components. The autoregulatory loop maintains robust pathway responsiveness (""on"") at sufficient concentrations of exogenous LIF, while autocrine signaling and low concentrations of exogenous LIF cause ESCs to adopt the weakly responsive (""off"") state of differentiated cells. We demonstrate that loss of ligand responsiveness is reversible and precedes loss of the ESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog, suggesting an early step in the hierarchical control of differentiation. While endogenously produced ligands were insufficient to sustain the ""on"" state, they buffer it, influencing the timing of differentiation. These results demonstrate a novel switch-like behavior, which establishes the LIF threshold for ESC self-renewal.","['Davey, Ryan E', 'Onishi, Kento', 'Mahdavi, Alborz', 'Zandstra, Peter W']","['Davey RE', 'Onishi K', 'Mahdavi A', 'Zandstra PW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2007 Jul;21(9):2020-32. doi: 10.1096/fj.06-7852com.

It is generally thought that RUNX1 exists as a monomer that regulates hematopoietic differentiation by interacting with tissue-specific factors and its DNA consensus through its N terminus. RUNX1 is frequently altered in human leukemia by gene fusions or point mutations. In general, these alterations do not affect the N terminus of the protein, and it is unclear how they consistently lead to hematopoietic transformation and leukemia. Here we report that RUNX1 homodimerizes through a mechanism involving C terminus-C terminus interaction. This RUNX1-RUNX1 interaction regulates the activity of the protein in reporter gene assays and modulates its ability to induce hematopoietic differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines. The promoters of genes regulated by RUNX1 often contain multiple RUNX1 binding sites. This arrangement suggests that RUNX1 could homodimerize to bring and hold together distant chromatin sites and factors and that if the dimerization region is removed by gene fusions or is altered by point mutations, as observed in leukemia, the ability of RUNX1 to regulate differentiation could be impaired.","['Li, Donglan', 'Sinha, Kislay K', 'Hay, Maher A', 'Rinaldi, Ciro R', 'Saunthararajah, Yogen', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Li D', 'Sinha KK', 'Hay MA', 'Rinaldi CR', 'Saunthararajah Y', 'Nucifora G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 May 4;282(18):13542-51. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M700074200.

Immune reconstitution after haploidentical bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is closely related to clinical events. This study was to analyze the repertoire of T-cell receptor beta chain variable region (TCRBV) and the molecular characteristics of T-cell clones during immune reconstitution in leukemia patients after haploidentical BMT. METHODS: Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to amplify 24 genes of TCRBV subfamily from peripheral blood lymphocytes of 9 leukemia patients after haploidentical BMT, and 5 healthy donors as control. The PCR products were analyzed by GeneScan to evaluate the clonality of BV subfamily, characteristics of complementarity determining region 3 (CDR3), and usage rate of BV subfamily. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-related monoclonal bands were sequenced. RESULTS: During 10-19 months after haploidentical BMT, the usage of TCRBV subfamily was still restricted. Deletion of some BV subfamily members was detected, while others expanded in monoclonal or oligoclonal. For 4 patients with stable disease, the expression of 9-14 BV subfamily members was detected, and more than 50% of them were polyclones. For other 5 patients with GVHD or cytomegalovirus (CMV)-pp65 infection, the usage of TCRBV decreased obviously(P<0.05), the expression of CDR3 were monoclonal or oligoclonal, only 30% were polyclonal. No common monoclonal BV subfamily members were detected. After treatment, the usage of BV subfamily and CDR3 polymorphism were increased in 2 patients. By analyzing the sequences associated with GVHD, none of the clones appeared to share any similarity in amino acid motif. CONCLUSIONS: In 10-19 months after haploidentical BMT, the usage of TCRBV subfamily members is still restricted. In stable condition, there are 9-14 BV subfamily members expressed and dominated by polyclones.

However, under various denominations, some of these methods have similar approaches. This study evaluates the influence of gene expression variance structure on the performance of methods that describe the relationship between gene expression levels and a given phenotype through projection of data onto discriminant axes. RESULTS: We compared Between-Group Analysis and Discriminant Analysis (with prior dimension reduction through Partial Least Squares or Principal Components Analysis). A geometric approach showed that these two methods are strongly related, but differ in the way they handle data structure. Yet, data structure helps understanding the predictive efficiency of these methods. Three main structure situations may be identified. When the clusters of points are clearly split, both methods perform equally well. When the clusters superpose, both methods fail to give interesting predictions. In intermediate situations, the configuration of the clusters of points has to be handled by the projection to improve prediction. For this, we recommend Discriminant Analysis. Besides, an innovative way of simulation generated the three main structures by modelling different partitions of the whole variance into within-group and between-group variances. These simulated datasets were used in complement to some well-known public datasets to investigate the methods behaviour in a large diversity of structure situations. To examine the structure of a dataset before analysis and preselect an a priori appropriate method for its analysis, we proposed a two-graph preliminary visualization tool: plotting patients on the Between-Group Analysis discriminant axis (x-axis) and on the first and the second within-group Principal Components Analysis component (y-axis), respectively. CONCLUSION: Discriminant Analysis outperformed Between-Group Analysis because it allows for the dataset structure. An a priori knowledge of that structure may guide the choice of the analysis method. Simulated datasets with known properties are valuable to assess and compare the performance of analysis methods, then implementation on real datasets checks and validates the results. Thus, we warn against the use of unchallenging datasets for method comparison, such as the Golub dataset, because their structure is such that any method would be efficient.","['Truntzer, Caroline', 'Mercier, Catherine', 'Esteve, Jacques', 'Gautier, Christian', 'Roy, Pascal']","['Truntzer C', 'Mercier C', 'Esteve J', 'Gautier C', 'Roy P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,PMC1831790,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2006/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2007/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2007 Mar 13;8:90. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-8-90.,,IM,,"['Computer Simulation', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Electronic Data Processing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/genetics']","['1471-2105-8-90 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2105-8-90 [doi]']",,"['CNRS, UMR 5558--Equipe Biostatistique Sante, Villeurbanne, France. caroline.truntzer@chu-lyon.fr']",,,20070313,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The addition of imatinib in patients with BCR-ABL-positive ALL has improved the prognosis of this subgroup, but their survival is still poor. Initial data on the second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitors, dasatinib and nilotinib, indicate a potentially greater efficacy than imatinib, but the improvement is likely to be modest. The overall efforts in terms of developmental therapeutics in ALL are very modest and not in keeping with the urgent need for improvement. Most agents being investigated have mechanisms of action similar to those of existing agents for ALL therapy and thus represent modest opportunities to improve results. Of such agents, data on BCR-ABL inhibitors, sphingosomal vincristine, pemetrexed, talotrexin, annamycin and ABT-751 are reviewed.","['Alvarado, Yesid', 'Apostolidou, Effrosyni', 'Swords, Ronan', 'Giles, Francis J']","['Alvarado Y', 'Apostolidou E', 'Swords R', 'Giles FJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,,2007/03/16 09:00,2007/04/12 09:00,['2007/03/16 09:00'],"['2007/03/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/16 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2007 Mar;12(1):165-79. doi: 10.1517/14728214.12.1.165.,"['0 (ABT751)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'SNU299M83Q (annamycin)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Glutamates/therapeutic use', 'Guanine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Pemetrexed', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Sulfonamides/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",['10.1517/14728214.12.1.165 [doi]'],,"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain tumor suppressor gene promoters are hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactivated, whereas repetitive DNA is hypomethylated and transcriptionally active. Little is understood about how the abnormal DNA methylation patterns of cancer cells are established and maintained. Here, we identify over 20 DNMT3B transcripts from many cancer cell lines and primary acute leukemia cells that contain aberrant splicing at the 5' end of the gene, encoding truncated proteins lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain. Many of these aberrant transcripts retain intron sequences. Although the aberrant transcripts represent a minority of the DNMT3B transcripts present, Western blot analysis demonstrates truncated DNMT3B isoforms in the nuclear protein extracts of cancer cells. To test if expression of a truncated DNMT3B protein could alter the DNA methylation patterns within cells, we expressed DNMT3B7, the most frequently expressed aberrant transcript, in 293 cells. DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells have altered gene expression as identified by microarray analysis. Some of these changes in gene expression correlate with altered DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. These results suggest that truncated DNMT3B proteins could play a role in the abnormal distribution of DNA methylation found in cancer cells.","['Ostler, K R', 'Davis, E M', 'Payne, S L', 'Gosalia, B B', 'Exposito-Cespedes, J', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Godley, L A']","['Ostler KR', 'Davis EM', 'Payne SL', 'Gosalia BB', 'Exposito-Cespedes J', 'Le Beau MM', 'Godley LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,PMC2435620,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/09/29 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Aug 16;26(38):5553-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210351.

To search for potential collaborating genetic abnormalities, we used oligonucleotide arrays to analyse over 116 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome in 16 JMML samples with normal karyotype. Evaluation of the SNP genotypes identified large regions of homozygosity on chromosome 17q, including the NF1 locus, in four of the five samples from patients with JMML and NF-1. The homozygous region was at least 55 million base pairs in each case. The genomic copy number was normal within the homozygous region, indicating uniparental disomy (UPD). In contrast, the array data provided no evidence for 17q UPD in any of the 11 JMML cases without NF-1. We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization to confirm 17q disomy, and microsatellite analysis was performed to verify homozygosity. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the inactivating NF1 lesion was present on both alleles in each case. In summary, our data indicate that a mitotic recombination event in a JMML-initiating cell led to 17q UPD with homozygous loss of normal NF1, provide confirmatory evidence that the NF1 gene is crucial for the increased incidence of JMML in NF-1 patients, and corroborate the concept that RAS pathway deregulation is central to JMML pathogenesis.","['Flotho, C', 'Steinemann, D', 'Mullighan, C G', 'Neale, G', 'Mayer, K', 'Kratz, C P', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Downing, J R', 'Niemeyer, C M']","['Flotho C', 'Steinemann D', 'Mullighan CG', 'Neale G', 'Mayer K', 'Kratz CP', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Downing JR', 'Niemeyer CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/10/05 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2007 Aug 23;26(39):5816-21. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1210361.

METHODS: We addressed this question in a murine model in which DLI is given to stable mixed chimeras resulting in lymphohematopoietic graft-versus-host (LH-GVH) response. In this model, LH-GVH potency can be directly measured as the kinetics of conversion to full donor chimerism and can be correlated with associated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity. RESULTS: We found discordance in DLI-mediated LH-GVH reactivity depending on the timing of rapamycin (RAPA) administration. Delayed administration of RAPA in contrast to its early administration at the time of adoptive transfer did not interfere with conversion to full donor chimerism. Moreover, delayed administration of RAPA preserved the GVL reactivity of DLI. Analysis of the long-term chimeras showed that regardless of RAPA administration, adoptively transferred T cells mediating the LH-GVH response contribute minimally to the reconstitution of the peripheral T-cell compartment and exhibit profound hyporesponsiveness and decreased production of interleukin (IL)-2 on restimulation in vitro. However, we observed only in the RAPA-treated chimeras that the remaining hyporesponsive DLI-derived CD4+ T cells secrete large amounts of IL-10, a known immunoregulatory cytokine. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that delayed administration of RAPA after DLI does not interfere with their LH-GVH reactivity but promotes the emergence of IL-10-secreting DLI-derived CD4+ T cells that might contribute to the drug's known ability to promote bilateral donor host tolerance without interfering with GVL reactivity.","['Durakovic, Nadira', 'Radojcic, Vedran', 'Powell, Jonathan', 'Luznik, Leo']","['Durakovic N', 'Radojcic V', 'Powell J', 'Luznik L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/04/21 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2007 Mar 15;83(5):631-40. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000256158.84418.ff.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-10/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Models, Animal', 'Sirolimus/*pharmacology', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000256158.84418.ff [doi]', '00007890-200703150-00019 [pii]']",,"['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA.']",['K08 CA89546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high mortality rate (40-80%) may be related to delayed diagnosis. We assessed the use of telemetric home surveillance of pulmonary function for early diagnosis of LONIPC in transplant recipients. METHODS: This prospective study monitored pulmonary function in 37 allogeneic HSCT recipients. About 3 months after HSCT, they received a portable spirometer that measured forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume per second, and midexpiratory flow 25-75 (MEF25-75). Data were transmitted twice weekly by telephone. Conventional plethysmography confirmed any significant deterioration (>20%). RESULTS: Thirteen episodes of spirometric deterioration were detected by telemetry in 11 patients during a median 17-month (4-41) follow-up period after transplantation. In these cases, examinations including spirometry, high-resolution thoracic computed tomography and bronchoalveolar lavage diagnosed LONIPC in eight episodes in seven patients (cumulative incidence 23.4%, SE 0.08, at month 24 after transplant): bronchiolitis obliterans (BO, n=3), interstitial pneumonia (IP, n=4), or both BO and IP (n=1). Five episodes improved and three were stabilized with increased immunosuppressive therapy. At the last follow-up, of the seven patients with LONIPC, one successfully stopped immunosuppressive therapy, two were receiving low-dose mycophenolate mofetil, and four were receiving low-dose corticosteroid therapy. There were no cases of respiratory failure and no patient died from LONIPC. CONCLUSION: Telemetric home monitoring of pulmonary function is a useful procedure for early diagnosis of LONIPC before clinical pulmonary symptoms and may improve outcome after allogeneic HSCT.","['Guihot, Amelie', 'Becquemin, Marie-Helene', 'Couderc, Louis-Jean', 'Randrianarivelo, Odile', 'Rivaud, Elisabeth', 'Philippe, Bruno', 'Sutton, Laurent', 'Neveu, Helene', 'Tanguy, Marie-Laure', 'Vernant, Jean-Paul', 'Dhedin, Nathalie']","['Guihot A', 'Becquemin MH', 'Couderc LJ', 'Randrianarivelo O', 'Rivaud E', 'Philippe B', 'Sutton L', 'Neveu H', 'Tanguy ML', 'Vernant JP', 'Dhedin N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/04/21 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 2007 Mar 15;83(5):554-60. doi: 10.1097/01.tp.0000228236.55419.33.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'Monitoring, Physiologic', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/therapy', 'Paris', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiography, Thoracic', '*Respiratory Function Tests', 'Spirometry', '*Telemetry', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*physiology']","['10.1097/01.tp.0000228236.55419.33 [doi]', '00007890-200703150-00007 [pii]']",,"['Service de Pneumologie, Hopital Foch, Suresnes, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The standard initial therapy for elderly acute promylocytic leukemia is the combination with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracyclines. For other acute myeloid leukemias (AML), many trials of combination chemotherapy have not improved the outcome of elderly patients. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin,which is an immunoconjugate binding to CD 33 on the surface of AML blasts, has produced good results for elderly patients in either monotherapy or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. One of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, imatinib mesylate, is active for elderly Philadelphia-positive leukemia including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia. In the treatment of elderly diffuse large B cell lymphoma, combination of rituximab and cyclophosphamide+doxorubicin+vincristine+prednisone (CHOP) has become the therapy of choice based upon a Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte (GELA) trial even though there are some other trials for elderly patients such as dose-dense CHOP therapy.

For the management of multiple myeloma, high-dose chemotherapy, mainly melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation, has become the standard treatment even for elderly patients less than 65 years of age.","['Usui, Noriko']",['Usui N'],['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

METHODS: The above parameters were analyzed in 105 ALL and NHL and 108 age and sex-matched controls. Serum albumin, serum cholesterol and hemoglobin were estimated by colorimetric methods. Serum retinol was estimated by HPLC and serum zinc was estimated by atomic emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES). Comparisons were made to stage of treatment (maintenance 6 with post-therapy), type of treatment (chemotherapy and radiation with only chemotherapy) and type of malignancy (ALL with NHL). RESULTS: Only serum albumin in patients included at Maintenance(6) was significantly higher (t = 2.31, p = 0.05) than post-therapy patients. No significant difference in serum values was observed by type of treatment. Only total cholesterol was significantly higher in NHL patients than in ALL patients (t = 1.954, p = 0.05). Patients had comparable serum levels to that of controls. However, in patients and controls more than 75% children had deficient serum retinol levels, (< than 0.6989 micromol/l, or 20 microg/dl). Further, 75% patients and 54.7% controls had serum retinol levels less than 0.3439 micromol/l or 10 microg/dl. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study indicate that cancer and its treatment did not have any long-lasting effect on serum albumin, total cholesterol, retinol, zinc and hemoglobin. Majority of subjects had low serum retinol suggestive of depleted liver reserves. The deficient serum retinol levels (< than 0.6989 micromol/l, or 20 microg/dl) in at least 75% of the patients and controls probably reflect poor dietary intake. A higher percentage of patients with low serum retinol levels may also be attributed to the possibility of urinary losses of retinol that occur during episodes of infection while on immunosuppressive anti-cancer drug therapy.","['Gokhale, Chanda D', 'Udipi, Shobha A', 'Ambaye, Ramkrishna Y', 'Pai, Suresh K', 'Advani, Suresh H']","['Gokhale CD', 'Udipi SA', 'Ambaye RY', 'Pai SK', 'Advani SH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Am Coll Nutr,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,8215879,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/05/01 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Coll Nutr. 2007 Feb;26(1):49-56. doi: 10.1080/07315724.2007.10719585.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Serum Albumin)', '0 (Trace Elements)', '0 (Vitamins)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Female', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Male', '*Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Serum Albumin/analysis', 'Trace Elements/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Vitamin A/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Vitamins/administration & dosage/*blood', 'Zinc/administration & dosage/blood']","['26/1/49 [pii]', '10.1080/07315724.2007.10719585 [doi]']",,"[""Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Research in Home Science, S.N.D.T.

The aim of this study was to analyze the prognostic significance of abdominal CT in patients with CLL in Rai clinical stage 0. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Abdominal CT was performed at diagnosis in 140 patients consecutively diagnosed with CLL in Rai stage 0 disease. RESULTS: An abnormal abdominal CT was found in 38 patients (27%). Abnormal CT correlated with increased bone marrow infiltration (P = .024), high lymphocyte count (P = .001), increased ZAP-70 expression (P = .003), and short lymphocyte doubling time (LDT; P = .007). Patients with abnormal CT progressed more frequently and had a shorter time to progression than those with normal CT (median, 3.5 years v not reached, respectively; P < .001) and required earlier treatment intervention. In a multivariate analysis, only high ZAP-70 expression (relative risk = 3.60) and an abnormal abdominal CT (RR = 2.71) correlated with disease progression. CONCLUSION: In this series, an abnormal abdominal CT was a strong predictor of progression in patients with early-stage CLL. The inclusion of CT scans in the initial work-up of patients with early clinical stage on clinical grounds can, therefore, provide relevant clinical information.","['Muntanola, Ana', 'Bosch, Francesc', 'Arguis, Pedro', 'Arellano-Rodrigo, Eduardo', 'Ayuso, Carmen', 'Gine, Eva', 'Crespo, Marta', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Moreno, Carol', 'Cobo, Francesc', 'Lopez-Guillermo, Armando', 'Montserrat, Emili']","['Muntanola A', 'Bosch F', 'Arguis P', 'Arellano-Rodrigo E', 'Ayuso C', 'Gine E', 'Crespo M', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Moreno C', 'Cobo F', 'Lopez-Guillermo A', 'Montserrat E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Apr 20;25(12):1576-80. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.4194.

Whether mature lymphocytes are susceptible to insertional mutagenesis is unknown. We have characterized a primary human CD8(+) T-cell clone, which exhibited logarithmic ex vivo growth in the absence of exogenous cytokine support for more than 1 year after transduction with a murine leukemia virus-based vector encoding the T-cell growth factor IL-15. Phenotypically, the clone was CD28(-), CD45RA(-), CD45RO(+), and CD62L(-), a profile consistent with effector memory T lymphocytes. After gene transfer with tumor-antigen-specific T-cell receptors, the clone secreted IFN-gamma upon encountering tumor targets, providing further evidence that they derived from mature lymphocytes. Gene-expression analyses revealed no evidence of insertional activation of genes flanking the retroviral insertion sites. The clone exhibited constitutive telomerase activity, and the presence of autocrine loop was suggested by impaired cell proliferation following knockdown of IL-15R alpha expression. The generation of this cell line suggests that nonphysiologic expression of IL-15 can result in the long-term in vitro growth of mature human T lymphocytes. The cytokine-independent growth of this line was a rare event that has not been observed in other IL-15 vector transduction experiments or with any other integrating vector system. It does not appear that the retroviral vector integration sites played a role in the continuous growth of this cell clone, but this remains under investigation.","['Hsu, Cary', 'Jones, Stephanie A', 'Cohen, Cyrille J', 'Zheng, Zhili', 'Kerstann, Keith', 'Zhou, Juhua', 'Robbins, Paul F', 'Peng, Peter D', 'Shen, Xinglei', 'Gomes, Theotonius J', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E', 'Munroe, David J', 'Stewart, Claudia', 'Cornetta, Kenneth', 'Wangsa, Danny', 'Ried, Thomas', 'Rosenberg, Steven A', 'Morgan, Richard A']","['Hsu C', 'Jones SA', 'Cohen CJ', 'Zheng Z', 'Kerstann K', 'Zhou J', 'Robbins PF', 'Peng PD', 'Shen X', 'Gomes TJ', 'Dunbar CE', 'Munroe DJ', 'Stewart C', 'Cornetta K', 'Wangsa D', 'Ried T', 'Rosenberg SA', 'Morgan RA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1890824,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 15;109(12):5168-77. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-029173.

Friend virus infects erythroid progenitor cells, followed by an initial polyclonal expansion of infected cells, which is driven by the activation of a naturally occurring truncated form of the Stk receptor tyrosine kinase (Sf-Stk). Subsequently, the accumulation of additional mutations in p53 and the activation of PU.1 result in full leukemic transformation. The early stages of transformation induced by Friend virus are characterized in vitro by the Epo-independent growth of infected erythroblasts. We have shown previously that this transforming event requires the kinase activity and Grb2 binding site of Sf-Stk and the recruitment of a Grb2/Gab2 complex to Sf-Stk. Here, we demonstrate that Stat3 is required for the Epo-independent growth of Friend virus-infected cells and that the activation of Stat3 by Sf-Stk is mediated by a novel Stat3 binding site in Gab2. These results underscore a central role for Stat3 in hematopoietic transformation and describe a previously unidentified role for Gab2 in the recruitment and activation of Stat3 in response to transforming signals generated by tyrosine kinases.","['Ni, Shuang', 'Zhao, Chunmei', 'Feng, Gen-Sheng', 'Paulson, Robert F', 'Correll, Pamela H']","['Ni S', 'Zhao C', 'Feng GS', 'Paulson RF', 'Correll PH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,PMC1899994,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/26 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2007 May;27(10):3708-15. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01838-06.

The relapse rates in these groups were 17%, 8%, 0%, and 0%, respectively, whereas the overall 7-year survival was 65%, 69%, 83%, and 98%, respectively. Our results support the usefulness of serially assessing MRD in patients with AL by means of FC; because this method is applicable to all cases of AL, despite being less sensitive than a molecular biology study; it is a good option to follow-up patients and to decide therapeutic and timely interventions.","['Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J', 'Fernandez-Lara, Danitza', 'Estrada-Gomez, Roberto', 'Manzano, Carlos', 'Ruiz-Delgado, Guillermo J', 'Perez-Romano, Beatriz', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Alejandro']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Fernandez-Lara D', 'Estrada-Gomez R', 'Manzano C', 'Ruiz-Delgado GJ', 'Perez-Romano B', 'Ruiz-Arguelles A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Hematol,Laboratory hematology : official publication of the International Society for Laboratory Hematology,9615688,,2007/03/14 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Hematol. 2007;13(1):22-6. doi: 10.1532/LH96.06045.,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*blood', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Survival Analysis']","['UH866252137VGM6T [pii]', '10.1532/LH96.06045 [doi]']",,"['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. gruiz1@clinicaruiz.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, PBX1 is required for haematopoiesis as well as for multiple developmental processes such as skeletal patterning and organogenesis. It has furthermore been shown that PBX1 functions as a HOX cofactor during development. More recent data suggest that PBX1 may act even more broadly by modulating the activity of non-homeodomain transcription factors. To better understand molecular mechanisms triggered by PBX1 during female genital tract development, we searched for additional PBX1 partners that might be involved in this process. Using a two hybrid screen, we identified a new PBX1 interacting protein containing several zinc finger motifs that we called ZFPIP for Zinc Finger PBX1 Interacting Protein. We demonstrated that ZFPIP is expressed in embryonic female genital tract but also in other PBX1 expression domains such as the developing head and the limb buds. We further showed that ZFPIP is able to bind physically and in vivo to PBX1 and moreover, that it prevents the binding of HOXA9/PBX complexes to their consensus DNA site. We suggest that ZFPIP is a new type of PBX1 partner that could participate in PBX1 function during several developmental pathways.","['Laurent, Audrey', 'Bihan, Rejane', 'Deschamps, Stephane', 'Guerrier, Daniel', 'Dupe, Valerie', 'Omilli, Francis', 'Burel, Agnes', 'Pellerin, Isabelle']","['Laurent A', 'Bihan R', 'Deschamps S', 'Guerrier D', 'Dupe V', 'Omilli F', 'Burel A', 'Pellerin I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Mech Dev,Mechanisms of development,9101218,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/22 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/30 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mech Dev. 2007 May;124(5):364-76. doi: 10.1016/j.mod.2007.01.008.

We determined the cytotoxicity (EC(50)) of 23 different flavonoids, including O-methylated and glucuronidated metabolites, on the human leukemia cell line Jurkat E6-1 by analyzing cell death triggered after 24 and 48 h. By comparing the cytotoxicity of selected molecules that differ in only one structure element, we identified several structure-function relationships associated with enhanced cytotoxicity, including the presence of a 2-3 double bond, the presence of a 4-carbonyl group and ortho- compared to meta-hydroxylation in the B ring. Molecules with a 3-hydroxyl group exhibited significantly lower cytotoxicity than their non-hydroxylated counterparts. O-Methylation and glucuronidation were associated with a significant increase in cytotoxicity, suggesting that metabolites found in vivo are more active than unmodified flavonoids. We identified the solubility maximum of the tested flavonoids in culture medium and found a negative correlation between maximum solubility and cytotoxicity. The results of our study may help to identify novel flavonoid structures with optimized cytotoxic activity to be tested for anti-cancer treatment.","['Plochmann, Kathrin', 'Korte, Gabriele', 'Koutsilieri, Eleni', 'Richling, Elke', 'Riederer, Peter', 'Rethwilm, Axel', 'Schreier, Peter', 'Scheller, Carsten']","['Plochmann K', 'Korte G', 'Koutsilieri E', 'Richling E', 'Riederer P', 'Rethwilm A', 'Schreier P', 'Scheller C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/21 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2007 Apr 1;460(1):1-9. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2007.02.003.

Morin-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells was also confirmed by flow cytometric assay, DNA gel electrophoresis for DNA fragmentation and DAPI staining.

In this study, the histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) of K104 on human cancer tissues was investigated in vitro and nephrotoxicity was examined in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cytotoxicity was tested in various cancer cell lines, and the HDRA of K104 was evaluated by MTT assay in vitro using colorectal and breast cancer tissues from patients. In order to compare the nephrotoxicity of K104 with cisplatin and carboplatin, blood serum levels of BUN, creatinine and uric acid in ICR mice were measured. RESULTS: K104 showed more effective anticancer activities than carboplatin in most cancer cell lines. In HDRA, K104 showed a 50.0-66.7% efficacy rate compared with 33.3% of cisplatin and 58.3% of carboplatin against colorectal cancer patient tissues. In breast cancer tissues, K104 only showed an efficacy rate above 50%. The serum levels of BUN, creatinine and uric acid did not change after a single intraperitoneal administration of K104 (90 mg/kg) in ICR mice. CONCLUSION: K104 showed more effective anticancer activities than carboplatin. Cisplatin was associated with nephrotoxic effects, but K104 did not change the serum levels of BUN, creatinine and uric acid in vivo. These results suggest that K104 is a promising anticancer agent in view of its high efficacy against human solid cancer and lower toxicity in vivo.","['Kwon, Young-Ee', 'Park, Jung-Youl', 'Kim, Won-Kyu']","['Kwon YE', 'Park JY', 'Kim WK']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Jan-Feb;27(1A):321-6.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (K104 compound)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blood Urea Nitrogen', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/blood/drug therapy', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*drug therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Uric Acid/blood']",,,"['College of Pharmacy, Woosuk University, Wanju-gun, Jeonbuk 565-701, Republic of Korea. yekwon@woosuk.ac.kr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the involvement of the Tiam1 gene products in bufalin-induced apoptosis in human solid tumor HeLa cells was examined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HeLa cells were treated with 10(-8) M bufalin and apoptosis was measured by ELISA quantification of nucleosomes. Tiam1 mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR analysis and inhibited by transfected siRNA specific for Tiam1. RESULTS: Apoptosis was induced in HeLa cells by treatment with 10(-8) M bufalin. Expression of both Tiam1 mRNA and its protein was induced 0.5 h after the start of the bufalin treatment. Transfection of Tiam1-specific siRNA into HeLa cells markedly inhibited bufalin-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that Tiam1 is a downstream mediator of bufalin-induced apoptosis in the human solid tumor HeLa cell line, as well as in leukemia cell lines.","['Cao-Hong', 'Shibayama-Imazu, Toshiko', 'Masuda, Yutaka', 'Shinki, Toshimasa', 'Nakajo, Shigeo', 'Nakaya, Kazuyasu']","['Cao-Hong', 'Shibayama-Imazu T', 'Masuda Y', 'Shinki T', 'Nakajo S', 'Nakaya K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/03/30 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2007 Jan-Feb;27(1A):245-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bufanolides)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis-inducing Protein 1)', '0 (TIAM1 protein, human)', 'U549S98QLW (bufalin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Bufanolides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'T-Lymphoma Invasion and Metastasis-inducing Protein 1', 'Transfection']",,,"['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Showa University, Tokyo 142-8555, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was no apparent difference in the cytotoxic activity between 2-methoxyazulenes [1a-1e, 2a-2e] and 2-ethoxyazulenes [3a-3e, 4a-4e]. Trichloroacetylazulenes [2a-2e, 4a-4e] generally showed higher cytotoxicity and tumor-specificity (expressed as a TS value) as compared with the corresponding trifluoroacetylazulenes [1a-1e, 3a-3e]. Substitution of chloride [1c, 2c, 3c. 4c], bromide [1d, 2d, 3d, 4d] or iodine [1e, 2e, 3e, 4e] at the C-3 position further enhanced cytotoxic activity against four tumor cell lines, especially HL-60 cells. Among twenty trihaloacetylazulene derivatives, two compounds [2d] and [4c] showed the highest tumor specificity (TS = > 3.5 and > 2.5, respectively). Compounds [2d] and [4c] induced apoptotic cell death characterized by caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, compounds [2d] and [4c] induced autophagic cell death characterized by lower activation of caspases, lack of DNA fragmentation, vacuolization and autophagosome formation detected by acridine orange and LC3-GFP fluorescence, without the decline of the intracellular concentration of three major polyamines in HSC-4 cells. The cytotoxic activity of [4c], but not [2d], was slightly reduced by 3-methyladenine, an inhibitor of autophagy.

In this study, we investigated the effects of baicalin (a compound obtained from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi and S. rivularis Benth Labiateae) on the viability, induction of apoptosis and associated mechanism in human leukemia HL-60 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cell viability and apoptosis was examined by flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that baicalin induced cytotoxicity in a dose- and time-dependent manner through the activation of caspase-3, as shown by treatment of HL-60 cells with an inhibitor of caspase-3 (z-VAD-fmk). Baicalin increased the levels of ROS, Ca2+ and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 cells. Western blot demonstrated that baicalin promoted the levels of Gadd153, Bax, cytochrome c and caspase-3 and -12, but decreased the levels of Grp78 and Bcl-2 in HL-60 cells.

Little data exist on the temporal variation in lung cancer risk after CLL, or its histological composition. We investigated the occurrence of second cancers in a large cohort of CLL patients with particular emphasis on lung cancer and its major subtypes. We followed all patients diagnosed with CLL in Denmark in the period 1943-2003 (n = 12,373) for the occurrence of second cancers. The relative risk was expressed as the standardized incidence ratio (SIR), i.e. the ratio of observed to expected number of cancers, based on incidence rates for the Danish population. During follow-up 1,105 cancers occurred among the CLL patients (SIR = 1.59 (95% CI 1.50-1.69)). SIR for all cancers combined remained elevated more than 10 years after CLL (SIR = 1.80 (1.56-2.08)). Lung cancer occurred in 141 patients (SIR = 1.61 (1.37-1.90)). The relative risk of lung cancer did not vary by gender, or time of follow-up, but was higher in younger (SIR(<60 years) = 2.22 (1.62-3.06)) than in older (SIR(70-79 years) = 1.21 (0.88-1.68)) age-groups. Elevated risks were observed for adenocarcinoma (SIR = 2.20 (1.57-3.08)) and squamous cell carcinoma (SIR = 1.52 (1.06-2.17)) of the lung.

Of late, exploitation of FOXP3(+) regulatory T-cell (T(REG)) function is emerging as a promising strategy in suppression of GVHD, while preserving graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). Cyclosporine and rapamycin reduce the expansion of effector T cells by blocking interleukin (IL)-2, but signaling by IL-2 is pivotal for T(REG) homeostasis. The resolution of GVHD is critically dependent on thymus-dependent reconstitution of the immunoregulatory system. Thus, there has been concern about the impact of blocking IL-2 signaling by immunosuppressive agents on T(REG) homeostasis. Here we demonstrate in a mouse model that in contrast to rapamycin, cyclosporine compromises not only the thymic generation of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells but also their homeostatic behavior in peripheral immune compartments. Treatment with cyclosporine resulted in a sharp reduction of peripheral CD25(+)FoxP3(+) T cells in all immune compartments studied. Prolonged rapamycin treatment allowed for thymic generation of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T cells, whereas treatment with cyclosporine led to a reduced generation of these cells. In conclusion, cyclosporine and rapamycin differentially affect homeostasis of CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T(REG) in vivo. As peripheral tolerance induction is a prerequisite for successful treatment outcome after allogeneic SCT, these findings are of potential clinical relevance.","['Coenen, J J A', 'Koenen, H J P M', 'van Rijssen, E', 'Kasran, A', 'Boon, L', 'Hilbrands, L B', 'Joosten, I']","['Coenen JJ', 'Koenen HJ', 'van Rijssen E', 'Kasran A', 'Boon L', 'Hilbrands LB', 'Joosten I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/23 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 May;39(9):537-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705628.

Our literature search yielded nine reports of 11 patients who had developed Torsades de Pointes anywhere from weeks to years following treatment with anthracyclines. One of the patients was hospitalized in our medical center. Risk factors and triggers for Torsades de Pointes, among other clinical aspects, were analyzed in each report.

William Dameshek is credited for introducing the term ""MPDs"" in 1951 when he used it to group chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) under one clinicopathologic category. Since then, other myeloid neoplasms have been added to the MPD member list: chronic neutrophilic (CNL), eosinophilic (CEL) and myelomonocytic (CMML) leukemias; juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML); hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES); systemic mastocytosis (SM); and others. Collectively, MPDs are stem cell-derived clonal proliferative diseases whose shared and diverse phenotypic characteristics can be attributed to dysregulated signal transduction--a consequence of acquired somatic mutations. The most recognized among the latter is BCR-ABL, the disease-causing mutation in CML. Other mutations of putative pathogenetic relevance in MPDs include: JAK2V617F in PV, ET, and PMF; JAK2 exon 12 mutations in PV; MPLW515L/K in PMF and ET; KITD816V in SM; FIP1L1-PDGFRA in CEL-SM; rearrangements of PDGFRB in CEL-CMML and FGFR1 in stem cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome; and RAS/PTPN11/NF1 mutations in JMML.

Phosphorylated histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) is located at DNA double-strand break (DSB) sites; furthermore, it recruits and retains damage-responsive proteins. This damage can be repaired by nonhomologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) and/or homologous recombinational repair (HR) pathways. A key component of NHEJ is the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) complex. Increased DNA-PK activity is associated with resistance to CLB in CLL. We used the specific DNA-PK inhibitor 2-(morpholin-4-yl)-benzo[h]chomen-4-one (NU7026) to sensitize CLL cells to chlorambucil. Our results indicate that in a CLL cell line (I83) and in primary CLL-lymphocytes, chlorambucil plus NU7026 has synergistic cytotoxic activity at nontoxic doses of NU7026. CLB treatment results in G(2)/M phase arrest, and NU7026 increases this CLB-induced G(2)/M arrest. Moreover, a kinetic time course demonstrates that CLB-induced DNA-PK activity was inhibited by NU7026, providing direct evidence of the ability of NU7026 to inhibit DNA-PK function. DSBs, visualized as gammaH2AX, were enhanced 24 to 48 h after CLB and further increased by CLB plus NU7026, suggesting that the synergy of the combination is mediated by NU7026 inhibition of DNA-PK with subsequent inhibition of DSB repair.","['Amrein, Lilian', 'Loignon, Martin', 'Goulet, Anne-Christine', 'Dunn, Michael', 'Jean-Claude, Bertrand', 'Aloyz, Raquel', 'Panasci, Lawrence']","['Amrein L', 'Loignon M', 'Goulet AC', 'Dunn M', 'Jean-Claude B', 'Aloyz R', 'Panasci L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,0376362,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2007 Jun;321(3):848-55. doi: 10.1124/jpet.106.118356.

Leukaemic stem cells exist in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and complete eradication of this group of cells would provide a curative therapy for this disease.","['Li, Shaoguang']",['Li S'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,PMC2063586,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/10/16 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/23 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2007;39(7-8):1483-8. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2007.01.027.

The purpose of this study was to define and classify the frequency and type of chromosomal abnormalities among newly diagnosed children with ALL and compare the results with those reported from other geographical regions of the world. METHODS: Bone marrow chromosomal studies with GTG banding were performed in untreated ALL pediatric patients aged from 7 days to 14 years. RESULTS: Among Omani children examined with ALL, 47 (81%) patients yielded results, with 26 (55.3%) showing an abnormal karyotype [10 (21.3%) pseudodiploid, 2 (4.3%) hypodiploid and 14 (29.7%) hyperdiploidy] and 21 (44.6%) had normal diploidy. Structural abnormalities were observed in 16 (34%), of which 11 (23.4%) cases were translocations, the most frequent being t(9;22) observed in three (6.4%) of our patients. Uncommon translocations such as t(9;15)(p11;q10), t(3;6)(p12;q11), t(1;6)(?31;?q23), t(1;19)(q12;q12), der(18)t(12;18)(q11;p11), and other structural aberrations add(2)(q22), add(6)(q16), add(18)(q22), add(14)(q32) along with deletions del(10)(q22), del(12)(p11), del(12)(p12), del(18)(q11) were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed a good correlation and concordance between the ploidy distribution by cytogenetics and flow cytometry. The patterns of chromosomal anomalies in our patients showed some variations in the frequency of aberrations reported. It is therefore necessary that newer techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) along with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and spectral karyotyping will help us identify chromosomal aberrations not detected by conventional cytogenetic methods in the near future. To our knowledge, this is the first report from the Middle East of a cytogenetic study on childhood ALL.","['Udayakumar, Achandira Muthappa', 'Bashir, Wafa Ahmed', 'Pathare, Anil Vasant', 'Wali, Yasser Ahmed', 'Zacharia, Mathew', 'Khan, Ashfaq Ahmed', 'Soliman, Heba', 'Al-Lamki, Zakia', 'Raeburn, John Alexander']","['Udayakumar AM', 'Bashir WA', 'Pathare AV', 'Wali YA', 'Zacharia M', 'Khan AA', 'Soliman H', 'Al-Lamki Z', 'Raeburn JA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2007 Apr;38(3):305-12. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2006.10.006.

Increase in gene dosage and overexpression are two major mechanisms for increasing MRP1 expression level. In many drug resistant cell lines, MRP1 gene amplification has been detected. However, it is not yet known whether gene amplification plays a role in inducing the multidrug resistance phenotype clinically. METHODS: To establish whether MRP1 gene copy number is a common feature of the upregulation of MRP1 expression in cancer patients, we studied the MRP1 gene copy number in leukemia patients by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and real-time PCR. This involved determination of the MRP1 gene copy number and mRNA level in the peripheral blood of 52 adult leukemic patients and ten healthy volunteers. The leukemic CCRF-CEM cell line (drug sensitive) and its drug-resistant subline CCRF-E1000, which has MRP1 overexpression, were used as controls. RESULTS: The MRP1 gene copy number in CCRF-CEM was normal but increased significantly in CCRF-E1000 cell line. However, in the presence or absence of MRP1 overexpression, increase in gene dosage was not detected in patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the increase in MRP1 gene dosage observed in resistant cell lines is not responsible for the upregulation of MRP1 expression in leukemic patients.","['Golalipour, Masoud', 'Mahjoubi, Frouzandeh', 'Sanati, Mohammad Hossein', 'Alimoghaddam, Kamran']","['Golalipour M', 'Mahjoubi F', 'Sanati MH', 'Alimoghaddam K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Med Res,Archives of medical research,9312706,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/06 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Med Res. 2007 Apr;38(3):297-304. doi: 10.1016/j.arcmed.2006.10.016.,"['0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', '*Gene Dosage', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Up-Regulation']","['S0188-4409(07)00073-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.arcmed.2006.10.016 [doi]']",,"['Clinical Genetics Department, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,"['Arch Med Res. 2007 Nov;38(8):909', 'Arch Med Res. 2008 May;39(4):466.

In this study we probed the possible requirement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) for T-cell receptor (TCR)-induced lipid raft formation. Microscopy and biochemical analyses illustrated that blockage of ROS production, by superoxide dismutase-mimic MnTBAP, significantly reduced partitioning of LAT, phospho-LAT, and PLC-gamma in lipid rafts. Another antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) displayed a similar suppressive effect on the entry of phospho-LAT into raft microdomains. The involvement of ROS in TCR-mediated raft assembly was observed in T-cell hybridomas, T leukemia cells, and normal T cells. Removal of ROS was accompanied by an attenuated activation of LAT and PKCtheta, with reduced production of IL-2. Consistently, treating T cells with the ROS-producer tert-butyl hydrogen peroxide (TBHP) greatly enhanced membrane raft formation, distribution of phospho-LAT into lipid rafts, and increased IL-2 production.

Since upregulation of Bcl-2 is often observed in recurrent or refractory hematological malignancies, we were prompted to investigate whether drug-selected leukemia cells overexpressing Bcl-2 were more susceptible to Bcl-2 antagonists. The current study showed that a camptothecin (CPT)-selected human leukemia cell line (CPT-K5) had remarkably higher expression levels of Bcl-2 than its drug sensitive parental cell (RPMI 8402). A small molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, HA14-1, induced much more extensive apoptosis in CPT-K5 than in RPMI 8402 cells, as characterized by DNA fragmentation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) and plasma membrane integrity, as well as the activation of caspase.

At present, little is known regarding how TGFbeta, and downstream Smad transcription factors, influence CML cell proliferation in the context of Bcr-Abl expression. Here we show that ectopic Bcr-Abl expression dramatically increases TGFbeta/Smad-dependent transcriptional activity in Cosl cells, and that this may be due to enhancement of Smad promoter activity. Bcr-Abl expressing TF-1 myeloid cells are more potently growth arrested by TGFbeta compared to the parental TF-1 cell line. Additionally, growth of Bcr-Abl-expressing CD34+ cells from chronic phase CML patients is inhibited by TGFbeta and, interestingly, treatment of a non-proliferating CD34+ CML cell sub-population with the TGFbeta kinase inhibitor SB431542 enhanced cell death mediated by the Bcr-Abl inhibitor imatinib. Our data suggest that the expression of Bcr-Abl leads to hyper-responsiveness of myeloid cells to TGFbeta, and we hypothesise that this novel cross-regulatory mechanism might play an important role in maintaining the transformed progenitor cell population in CML.","['Moller, Gigi M O', 'Frost, Victoria', 'Melo, Junia V', 'Chantry, Andrew']","['Moller GM', 'Frost V', 'Melo JV', 'Chantry A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/12 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2007 Apr 3;581(7):1329-34. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.02.048.

In this study, treatment of IL-2-activated NK cells with HDACi including suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid and valproic acid was studied. Both drugs at therapeutic concentrations inhibited NK cell cytotoxicity on human leukemic cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased expression and function of NK cell activating receptors NKp46 and NKp30 as well as impaired granule exocytosis. NFkappaB activation in IL-2-activated NK cells was inhibited by both HDACi. Pharmacologic inhibition of NFkappaB activity resulted in similar effects on NK cell activity like those observed for HDACi. These results demonstrate for the first time that HDACi prevent NK cytotoxicity by downregulation of NK cell activating receptors probably through the inhibition of NFkappaB activation.","['Ogbomo, Henry', 'Michaelis, Martin', 'Kreuter, Jorg', 'Doerr, Hans Wilhelm', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr']","['Ogbomo H', 'Michaelis M', 'Kreuter J', 'Doerr HW', 'Cinatl J Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,FEBS Lett,FEBS letters,0155157,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2006/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/09 00:00 [revised]', '2007/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FEBS Lett. 2007 Apr 3;581(7):1317-22. doi: 10.1016/j.febslet.2007.02.045.

Some experiments had shown that it was possible to reverse differentiation blockage in AML cells by CD44 ligation with specific antibodies, indicating that CD44 was closely related to the differentiation of leukemia cells. The differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 cells could be induced by all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), but so far the mechanism was not demonstrated clearly. In the present study, we investigated whether ATRA or HMBA induced the growth arrest of HL-60 cells by down-regulating the expression of CD44. The results indicated that the proliferation of HL-60 cells was obviously inhibited and the differentiation was induced by both ATRA and HMBA. The decreased expression of CD44 and cyclin E mRNA, and the increased expression of p27 and p21 at mRNA levels were observed. Furthermore, there was a negative correlation between the expression of CD44 and p27. It was concluded that ATRA and HMBA played a role in the differentiation induction of HL-60 cells, which was mediated by the down-regulation of CD44, accompanied by down-regulation of cyclin E, and up-regulation of p27 and p21 mRNA.","['Liu, Jianing', 'Bi, Gaofeng', ""Wen, Pei'e"", 'Yang, Weihua', 'Ren, Xia', 'Tang, Tianhua', 'Xie, Chao', 'Dong, Wei', 'Jiang, Guosheng']","['Liu J', 'Bi G', 'Wen P', 'Yang W', 'Ren X', 'Tang T', 'Xie C', 'Dong W', 'Jiang G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/02 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2007 Feb;4(1):59-63.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin E/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/genetics/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",,,"['Department of Hemato-oncology, Institute of Basic Medicine, Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences, Jinan, Shandong 250062, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We and others have presented evidence to suggest that Fas-induced apoptosis may be an important aspect of the resolution of inflammation, and that delayed resolution of inflammation may be directly associated with NF-kappaB-dependent resistance to Fas. Because TNF-alpha activates NF-kappaB in many cell types including inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, we examined effects of TNF-alpha signaling on the Fas-mediated killing of an eosinophilic cell line AML14. While agonist anti-Fas (CH11) treatment induced apoptosis in AML14 cells, no significant cell death occurred in response to TNF-alpha alone. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) revealed that TNF-alpha induced NF-kappaB transactivation in AML14 cells in a time- and dose-dependent fashion, and subsequent supershift assays indicated that the translocated NF-kappaB was the heterodimer p65 (RelA)/p50. Pre-treatment of cells with TNF-alpha dramatically decreased the CH11-induced cell death in a transient fashion, accompanied by suppression of activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3 activation. Inhibition of NF-kappaB transactivation by inhibitors, BAY 11-7085 and parthenolide, reversed the suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis by TNF-alpha. Furthermore, TNF-alpha up-regulated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) transiently and XIAP levels were correlated with the temporal pattern of TNF-alpha protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis. This finding suggested that TNF-alpha may contribute to the prolonged survival of inflammatory cells by suppression of Fas-mediated apoptosis, the process involved with NF-kappaB transactivation, anti-apoptotic XIAP up-regulation and caspase suppression.","['Qin, Yimin', 'Auh, Sogyong', 'Blokh, Lyubov', 'Long, Catherine', 'Gagnon, Isabelle', 'Hamann, Kimm J']","['Qin Y', 'Auh S', 'Blokh L', 'Long C', 'Gagnon I', 'Hamann KJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",China,Cell Mol Immunol,Cellular & molecular immunology,101242872,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/06/02 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Immunol. 2007 Feb;4(1):43-52.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (BAY 11-7085)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Sulfones)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*immunology', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/immunology', 'Fas Ligand Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Nitriles/pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/pharmacology', 'Sulfones/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology/*physiology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",,,"['Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. yqin@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']","['HL66026/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL79641/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lack of such an activity in humans, owing to a genetic disorder, causes T-cell impairment, and thus drugs that inhibit human PNP activity have the potential of being utilized as modulators of the immunological system to treat leukemia, autoimmune diseases, and rejection in organ transplantation. Besides, the purine salvage pathway is the only possible way for apicomplexan parasites to obtain the building blocks for RNA and DNA synthesis, which makes PNP from these parasites an attractive target for drug development against diseases such as malaria. Hence, a number of research groups have made efforts to elucidate the mechanism of action of PNP based on structural and kinetic studies.

Ten poor-risk adult patients with hematological malignancy received multiple unit, HLA-unmatched, sex-mismatched, unrelated UCB transplantation after a reduced intensity-conditioning regimen (RICR) with engraftment as the primary endpoint. The median age of the patients was 55 years with a range of 28-67. Patients received one unit of UCB per 10 kg of recipient body weight (5-7 units). The median number of nucleated cells and CD34(+) cells per kilogram of recipient body weight infused was 6.3 x 10(7) (range 3.8-10.0) (NC/kg) and 5.7 x 10(5) (range 1.1-11.9) (CD34/kg), respectively. Three patients expired before day 28 and were not evaluable for engraftment. Five of the remaining 7 patients showed increasing neutrophil counts. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for the Y chromosome or HLA-typing showed only donor cells in the peripheral blood. After engraftment, HLA typing was done on 3 patients and their infused UCB units. All revealed the presence of a single HLA type concordant with one of the infused units. Moreover, the order of infusion did not influence which UCB unit engrafted. The engrafting UCB units were infused first or second in one case and fourth in the other two. One patient transplanted for refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survives in continuous complete remission 4 years after transplant. He engrafted with one UCB unit, is fully hematologically reconstituted, has no evidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and takes no immunosuppressive medication. HLA typing reveals that the recipient and the engrafted cord blood match at only one HLA-B locus using conventional 6 antigen typing (A, B, and DR). Although engraftment was not accelerated, it did occur in the majority of evaluable patients. Long-term disease-free survivorship without debilitating GVHD is possible in patients with refractory hematological malignancy who receive unmatched multiple unit UCB.","['Lister, John', 'Gryn, Jeffrey F', 'McQueen, Karina L', 'Harris, David T', 'Rossetti, James M', 'Shadduck, Richard K']","['Lister J', 'Gryn JF', 'McQueen KL', 'Harris DT', 'Rossetti JM', 'Shadduck RK']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/07/27 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2007 Feb;16(1):177-86. doi: 10.1089/scd.2006.06500-HB.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'HLA Antigens/genetics/*immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",['10.1089/scd.2006.06500-HB [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Western Pennsylvania Hospital and Western Pennsylvania Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15224, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL and its treatment as well, may cause disturbances of central transmission of acoustic stimuli. THE AIM: To establish, if testing of egzogenic provoked brain stem potentials can be useful for evaluation of complications of ALL treatment. The issue of analysis was the influence of past ALL and type of therapy on parameters of egzogenic potentials triggered by acoustic stimulus (BAEP) in patients after termination of treatment. RESULTS: In the group of patients treated with NY program results of middle latencies of the wave I and III were normal, however latencies of wave V and interlatencies of waves I-III, I-IV and III-V were mildly elongated. Latencies and interlatencies elongated above the upper normal range were detected in 4 patients of this group: in one patient elongation of the wave V and interlatencies of waves I-IV and III-V was detected, while in the other one interlatencies of waves I-III and I-V and in the last two patients only interlatencies of waves I-III. In the group of patients treated with BFM 86/87 programs results were similar. Latencies of waves I and III were normal, while mean latencies of wave V and interlatencies of waves I-III, I-V and III-V were mildly elongated. In this group mild pathological elongation of BAEP interlatencies were detected in 5 patients. Non of them had elongation of latencies of waves I, III or V. In one patient elongated interlatencies of waves I-V and III-V were detected, in another one interlatencies of waves I-III, while in other 3 patients elongation of latencies of waves I-V. In the group of patients treated with BFM 95 program latencies of waves I, III and V were normal, while interlatencies of waves I-III, I-V and III-V were mildly elongated. In 2 patients of this group mild elongation of interlatencies of waves I-III or III-V were detected. In each patient of this group, similar as in the group BFM 86/87, latencies of waves I, III and V were normal. CONCLUSIONS: (1) BAEP abnormalities in 22.4% of patients after the treatment of childhood ALL suggest that hearing monitoring in these patients is recommended. (2) Elongation of BAEP interlatencies and latency of wave V in patients after radiation OUN therapy warrant to develop new and less toxic therapies.","['Kroczka, Slawomir', 'Steczkowska-Klucznik, Malgorzata', 'Romaniszyn, Agata']","['Kroczka S', 'Steczkowska-Klucznik M', 'Romaniszyn A']",['pol'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,,2007/03/14 09:00,2007/05/18 09:00,['2007/03/14 09:00'],"['2007/03/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2006;63(11):1205-9.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'BFM 78 protocol', 'BFM-86 protocol', 'New York protocol']",IM,,"['Acoustic Stimulation', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Hearing Disorders/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Hearing Tests/methods', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Reaction Time/drug effects', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,,"['Pracownia Neurofizjologii Kliniki Neurologii, Dzieciecej Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego. neupedkr@cm-uj.krakow.pl']",,Egzogenne potencjaly wywolane bodzcem sluchowym u pacjentow po zakonczonym leczeniu z powodu ostrej dzieciecej bialaczki limfoblastycznej.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Often, rather than comparison of the entire survival curves, interest is focused on the comparison at a fixed point in time. In most cases, the naive test based on a difference in the estimates of survival is used for this comparison. In this note, we examine the performance of alternatives to the naive test. These include tests based on a number of transformations of the survival function and a test based on a generalized linear model for pseudo-observations. The type I errors and power of these tests for a variety of sample sizes are compared by a Monte Carlo study. We also discuss how these tests may be extended to situations where the data are stratified. The pseudo-value approach is also applicable in more detailed regression analysis of the survival probability at a fixed point in time. The methods are illustrated on a study comparing survival for autologous and allogeneic bone marrow transplants.","['Klein, John P', 'Logan, Brent', 'Harhoff, Mette', 'Andersen, Per Kragh']","['Klein JP', 'Logan B', 'Harhoff M', 'Andersen PK']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,2007/03/10 09:00,2008/01/03 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2007 Oct 30;26(24):4505-19. doi: 10.1002/sim.2864.,,IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Linear Models', 'Models, Statistical', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",['10.1002/sim.2864 [doi]'],"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Division of Biostatistics, Medical College of Wisconsin, 8701 Watertown Plank Road, Milwaukee, WI 53226, USA. klein@mcw.edu']",['R01 CA54706-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Implantation of these cells into the brain, however, requires their prior differentiation. We examined the interplay between leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and retinoic acid (RA) on neural differentiation of mouse ES (mES) cells. Mouse embryonic stem cells were allowed to form cell aggregates, the so-called embryoid bodies (EBs), in the absence or presence of LIF. In the absence of LIF, mES cells downregulated the expression of the undifferentiated mES cell marker Oct-3/4, and increased mRNA levels of two neural precursor markers, Sox-1 and Nestin, as well as the neuronal marker beta-tubulin III. This neuronal differentiation was enhanced by treating EBs with RA. Moreover, RA irreversibly increased the number of postmitotic neurons in culture, as shown by the reduction of proliferating mES cells and the increase in beta-tubulin III-positive cells 6 days after RA removal, which in turn affected mES cell viability. The addition of LIF during EBs formation, however, blocked completely this neuronal differentiation. Our findings also showed that pre-differentiation of mES cells in vitro avoided the teratocarcinoma formation observed when proliferating mES cells were grafted into the brain. In addition, mES cells pre-differentiated with RA in culture showed a reduction in proliferation and the presence of neural phenotypes after grafting. In conclusion, the present results indicate that RA enhances neuronal differentiation of mES cells in the absence of LIF, although it compromises cell viability and transplantation.","['Martin-Ibanez, Raquel', 'Urban, Noelia', 'Sergent-Tanguy, Solene', 'Pineda, Jose Ramon', 'Garrido-Clua, Nuria', 'Alberch, Jordi', 'Canals, Josep M']","['Martin-Ibanez R', 'Urban N', 'Sergent-Tanguy S', 'Pineda JR', 'Garrido-Clua N', 'Alberch J', 'Canals JM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,,2007/03/10 09:00,2008/01/05 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2007 Sep;85(12):2686-701. doi: 10.1002/jnr.21228.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (Organic Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (Sox1 protein, mouse)', '0 (solute carrier family 22 (organic cation transporter), member 3)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/drug effects', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Organic Cation Transport Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors', 'Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",['10.1002/jnr.21228 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Departament de Biologia Cellular i Anatomia Patologica, Facultat de Medicina, IDIBAPS, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The constitutive activity of the BCR may be important for tumor formation, at least in the case of heavy-chain diseases, neoplastic proliferations developed from B cells. A large body of evidence suggests that this activity could be required for B cell survival and would play a role in B cell development as a process monitoring BCR functionality.

Today anticancer drug discovery is mainly target driven, which requires the characterization of molecular targets in existing cell lines or xenograft models. However, this analysis is time consuming and labor intensive. In order to ease this bottleneck, we have established tissue microarrays of 41 human tumor cell lines on glass slides. The purpose of our study was to (a) establish a simple and efficient method for cell line microarray construction, (b) apply the resulting array to the profiling of cathepsin B and transferrin receptor by immunohistochemistry and (c) verify the results in separate Western blot analyses. Ten to twenty million (1-2 x 10(7)) cells were harvested without trypsinization and fixed with Bouin's solution containing 8% formalin. Cell pellets 2-5 mm in diameter were embedded in paraffin. Microarrays were assembled using a tissue arrayer. Pellet biopsies 0.6 cm in diameter were taken and arrayed in duplicate in a new recipient paraffin block. About 60 slides can be obtained from one block. Citrate buffer was used for antigen retrieval. Expression of cathepsin B was granular and located in the cytoplasm. High cathepsin B levels were detected in 2 melanomas (MEXF 514L and MEXF 276L) and in the renal cell line RXF 486L. Twenty-five cell lines showed only minimal positivity. Nine cell lines of leukemia and lymphoma, breast, ovarian, prostate and renal cancer origin were positive for the transferrin receptor, while 32 cell lines were negative. Western blotting confirmed the results obtained by immunohistochemistry. Using these cell line microarrays, cell lines overexpressing a target of interest can be selected for in vitro evaluation of specific inhibitors.","['Wirth, Gregory J', 'Schandelmaier, Kathrin', 'Smith, Victoria', 'Burger, Angelika M', 'Fiebig, Heinz-Herbert']","['Wirth GJ', 'Schandelmaier K', 'Smith V', 'Burger AM', 'Fiebig HH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2006/07/07 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 2006;71(1-2):86-94. doi: 10.1159/000100476.

However, it is not clear if these associations are a direct result of elevated Bcr-Abl expression. We used a human transduction model of CML to directly investigate the role of varying Bcr-Abl expression levels in determining the phenotype and IM sensitivity of hematopoietic cells. CD34(+) cells were transduced with vectors coexpressing Bcr-Abl and GFP, and cells expressing low and high levels of GFP and Bcr-Abl (BA(lo) and BA(hi)) were selected. BA(hi) cells demonstrated enhanced activation of downstream proliferative and antiapoptotic signaling and enhanced proliferation and survival compared to BA(lo) cells. Freshly isolated BA(hi) CD34(+) cells and cell lines demonstrated increased IM-mediated growth inhibition likely reflecting Bcr-Abl dependence for growth and survival. CD34(+) cells expressing BCR/ABL kinase-mutant genes demonstrated resistance to IM-mediated inhibition of proliferation and viability, which was not enhanced by increased expression of BCR/ABL kinase-mutant genes. We conclude that Bcr-Abl overexpression results in increased proliferation and antiapoptotic signaling in CD34(+) cells, but may not play a direct role in IM resistance in progenitor cells expressing either wild-type or mutant BCR/ABL genes.","['Modi, Hardik', 'McDonald, Tinisha', 'Chu, Su', 'Yee, Jiing-Kuan', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Bhatia, Ravi']","['Modi H', 'McDonald T', 'Chu S', 'Yee JK', 'Forman SJ', 'Bhatia R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1890842,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 15;109(12):5411-21. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-06-032490.

During investigation of candidate genes operative in granulopoiesis, we identified DAPK2 as highly expressed. Subsequent investigations demonstrated particularly high DAPK2 expression in normal granulocytes compared with monocytes/macrophages and CD34(+) progenitor cells. Moreover, significantly increased DAPK2 mRNA levels were seen when cord blood CD34(+) cells were induced to differentiate toward neutrophils in tissue culture. In addition, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced neutrophil differentiation of two leukemic cell lines, NB4 and U937, revealed significantly higher DAPK2 mRNA expression paralleled by protein induction. In contrast, during differentiation of CD34(+) and U937 cells toward monocytes/macrophages, DAPK2 mRNA levels remained low. In primary leukemia, low expression of DAPK2 was seen in acute myeloid leukemia samples, whereas chronic myeloid leukemia samples in chronic phase showed intermediate expression levels. Lentiviral vector-mediated expression of DAPK2 in NB4 cells enhanced, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated DAPK2 knockdown reduced ATRA-induced granulocytic differentiation, as evidenced by morphology and neutrophil stage-specific maturation genes, such as CD11b, G-CSF receptor, C/EBPepsilon, and lactoferrin.

To address this issue, we first identified an HLA-A2.1-restricted T cell antigen epitope of SEREX-identified tumor antigen CML66L, 66Pa. The HLA-A2.1/66Pa peptide complex in vitro stimulated the in vivo-primed T cells as shown by increased T cell proliferation, higher secretion of the T cell cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), increased production of intracellular IFN-gamma in CD8+ T cells, and higher T cell-mediated cytotoxicities of CML66L+ human tumor cells. This suggests that CML66L elicits T cell immune responses. We also developed a novel internal reference epitope for identification of T cell epitopes by construction of chimeric CML66L containing myeloid antigen proteinase 3 epitope Pr1 as a control. Finally, we found that nTreg cells regulates T cell responses to 66Pa, and that depletion of nTreg cells via a pro-apoptotic protein Bax-dependent mechanism enhances polyclonal T cell responses to 66Pa. These findings provide new insights into the T cell participation in SEREX-defined anti-tumor immune responses and novel direction in enhancement of anti-leukemia immunotherapy by modulation of homeostasis of nTreg cells.","['Yan, Y', 'Chen, Y', 'Yang, F', 'Chen, I H', 'Xiong, Z', 'Wang, J', 'Lachman, L B', 'Wang, H', 'Yang, X-F']","['Yan Y', 'Chen Y', 'Yang F', 'Chen IH', 'Xiong Z', 'Wang J', 'Lachman LB', 'Wang H', 'Yang XF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,PMC2919235,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2007 Jan-Mar;20(1):75-89. doi: 10.1177/039463200702000109.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (NUDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epitopes/genetics/immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/*physiology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/physiology', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Peptides/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Vaccines, DNA', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/physiology']","['9 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200702000109 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Temple University School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']","['K08 AI054514/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI054514-06/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI054514/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS210824'],,,,,,,,

Supporting a role for B-cells in the genesis of autoimmune diseases is the fact that the B-cell activating factor of the TNF ligand family (BAFF) is essential in their physiology. However, in each disease, this is restricted to a subgroup of patients. Based on experiments in mice, and validated in humans, this new cytokine has been highlighted. Excessive production of BAFF alters immune tolerance by rescuing self-binding B-cells. Overexpression in mice leads to autoimmune manifestation, and BAFF levels are elevated in the serum of autoimmune patients. Similar abnormalities occur in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Recent works suggest that antagonizing the protein (or competing for its receptors) is relevant to the treatment. Advances in our understanding of the BAFF system offers the opportunity to improve our therapeutic approach.","['Bosello, S', 'Pers, J-O', 'Rochas, C', 'Devauchelle, V', 'De Santis, M', 'Daridon, C', 'Saraux, A', 'Ferraccioli, G F', 'Youinou, P']","['Bosello S', 'Pers JO', 'Rochas C', 'Devauchelle V', 'De Santis M', 'Daridon C', 'Saraux A', 'Ferraccioli GF', 'Youinou P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol,International journal of immunopathology and pharmacology,8911335,,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Immunopathol Pharmacol. 2007 Jan-Mar;20(1):1-8. doi: 10.1177/039463200702000101.,['0 (B-Cell Activating Factor)'],IM,,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Autoimmune Diseases/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'B-Cell Activating Factor/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Rheumatic Diseases/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Scleroderma, Systemic/genetics/pathology/therapy', ""Sjogren's Syndrome/genetics/pathology/therapy""]","['1 [pii]', '10.1177/039463200702000101 [doi]']",,"['Laboratory of Immunology, Medical School, Brest, France.']",,,,36,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strategies, which aim at inhibiting hyperactive signaling molecules, appear conceptually straight forward, but their translation into clinical practice has been hampered by many setbacks. Understanding structure, function and regulation of this intracellular pathway as well as its crosstalk with other signaling activities in the cell will be essential to ensure reasonable usage of new therapeutic possibilities. This review provides an understanding of this signaling cascade as revealed by genetic and biochemical approaches and discusses the existing or arising possibilities to interfere with unphysiological activation in cancer. Signaling aberrations and signal transduction therapies will be discussed exemplary for two types of hematological neoplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and the myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). In the future understanding the role of tumor stem cells, both as a source of tumor recurrence and tumor heterogeneity, the signals controlling their fate as well as epigenetic changes in cancer will be the next critical steps to further advance the applicability of these novel therapeutic strategies.","['Zebisch, Armin', 'Czernilofsky, Armin P', 'Keri, Gyorgy', 'Smigelskaite, Julja', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Troppmair, Jakob']","['Zebisch A', 'Czernilofsky AP', 'Keri G', 'Smigelskaite J', 'Sill H', 'Troppmair J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2007;14(5):601-23. doi: 10.2174/092986707780059670.,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (raf Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cytoplasm/enzymology/genetics', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Genes, ras/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/physiology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'raf Kinases/genetics/*physiology']",['10.2174/092986707780059670 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.']",['W 1101/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,202,,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic criteria rely primarily on morphological classification, while prognostic evaluation is determined by cytogenetic methods. Survival is highly variable and it is a matter of debate, whether alternative therapeutic approaches may improve the effectiveness of conventional cytotoxic drug treatment. Two transmembrane proteins undoubtedly contribute to worse prognosis: P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and FLT3. Pgp is a transmembrane, ATP-cassette binding efflux pump that efficiently removes structurally unrelated xenobiotics from leukaemic blasts. This leads to inefficiency towards several cytotoxic drugs, hence the phenomenon is called multidrug resistance. FLT3 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase and an internal tandem duplication can considerably augment its kinase activity. Both mechanisms lead to chemotherapy resistance and significantly shorter survival; thus several studies have been designed to treat patients via therapeutic measures that neutralize these proteins. This review focuses on the pathophysiological phenomena and the detection methods of Pgp and FLT3 as well as on novel therapeutic strategies that are offered by their inhibition.","['Kappelmayer, Janos', 'Udvardy, Miklos', 'Antal-Szalmas, Peter']","['Kappelmayer J', 'Udvardy M', 'Antal-Szalmas P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United Arab Emirates,Curr Med Chem,Current medicinal chemistry,9440157,,2007/03/10 09:00,2007/04/03 09:00,['2007/03/10 09:00'],"['2007/03/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/10 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Curr Med Chem. 2007;14(5):519-30. doi: 10.2174/092986707780059661.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*genetics/*physiology', 'Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/physiology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*physiology']",['10.2174/092986707780059661 [doi]'],,"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Molecular Pathology, Medical and Health Science Center, University of Debrecen, Hungary. kappelmayer@jaguar.unideb.hu']",,,,139,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, a retrospective analysis was conducted to determine the incidence of PCP in pediatric patients who received prophylactic atovaquone during treatment for acute leukemia. METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients treated at our institution for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia between 1994 and 2004. Only patients who were intolerant of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) and received atovaquone prophylaxis were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients were unable to tolerate TMP-SMZ and received daily atovaquone for PCP prophylaxis. PCP was not diagnosed in any patient who received atovaquone prophylaxis: the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.74 per 100 person-years. CONCLUSIONS: Atovaquone is an efficacious alternative for PCP prophylaxis in pediatric patients who have leukemia and are intolerant of TMP-SMZ.","['Madden, Renee M', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Hughes, Walter T', 'Flynn, Patricia M', 'Leung, Wing']","['Madden RM', 'Pui CH', 'Hughes WT', 'Flynn PM', 'Leung W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):1654-8. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22562.,,IM,,"['Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/*complications/prevention & control', 'Pneumocystis carinii', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/*complications/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Retrospective Studies']",['10.1002/cncr.22562 [doi]'],,"[""Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA. renee.madden@stjude.org""]",['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Nat Clin Pract Oncol. 2007 Oct;4(10):566-7.

Data from a population-based case-control study in Germany (1992-1997) that included 1,867 cases and 2,057 controls was used to investigate this question. Maternal use of vitamin, folate or iron supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and tumors and, less clearly, with leukemia, but not with CNS tumors. An increased risk of neuroblastoma was associated most markedly with diuretics and other antihypertensives, but also with vitamin, folate or iron supplementation. No associations were seen with pain relievers, antinauseants or cold medications, nor with delivery by Caesarian section. The strengths of this study are its population base, the large number of cases and the inclusion of different case groups to identify disease specificity of associations. The limitation of this study is an exposure assessment relying on maternal self-reports. In conclusion, these data indicate a potential influence of some maternal medication during pregnancy on the risk of childhood cancer in the offspring; however, no clear picture is seen.","['Schuz, Joachim', 'Weihkopf, Thomas', 'Kaatsch, Peter']","['Schuz J', 'Weihkopf T', 'Kaatsch P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/12/06 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/06 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2007 May;166(5):433-41. doi: 10.1007/s00431-006-0401-z.

We previously reported that some flavonoids have BCRP-inhibitory activity. Here we show the reversal effects of an extensive panel of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. METHODS: Reversal effects of flavonoids upon BCRP-, P-gp-, or MRP1-mediated drug resistance were examined in the BCRP- or MDR1-transduced human leukemia K562 cells or in the MRP1-transfected human epidermoid carcinoma KB-3-1 cells using cell growth inhibition assays. The IC(50) values were determined from the growth inhibition curves. The RI(50) values were then determined as the concentration of inhibitor that causes a twofold reduction of the IC(50) in each transfectant. The reversal of BCRP activity was tested by measuring the fluorescence of intracellular topotecan. RESULTS: The BCRP-inhibitory activity of 32 compounds was screened, and 20 were found to be active. Among these active compounds, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone showed the strongest anti-BCRP activity with RI(50) values of 0.012 microM for SN-38 and 0.044 muM for mitoxantrone. We next examined the effects of a panel of 11 compounds on P-gp- and MRP1-mediated drug resistance. Two of the flavones, 3',4',7-trimethoxyflavone and acacetin, showed only low anti-P-gp activity, with the remainder displaying no suppressive effects against P-gp. None of the flavonoids that we tested inhibited MRP1. CONCLUSION: Our present results thus indicate that many flavonoids selectively inhibit BCRP only. Moreover, we examined the structure-BCRP inhibitory activity relationship from our current study.","['Katayama, Kazuhiro', 'Masuyama, Kazuto', 'Yoshioka, Sho', 'Hasegawa, Hitomi', 'Mitsuhashi, Junko', 'Sugimoto, Yoshikazu']","['Katayama K', 'Masuyama K', 'Yoshioka S', 'Hasegawa H', 'Mitsuhashi J', 'Sugimoto Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/11/10 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2007 Nov;60(6):789-97. doi: 10.1007/s00280-007-0426-7.

We investigated hTERT gene expression in 134 B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cases and evaluated its prognostic value with other prognostic markers (IgVH mutation status, CD38 and ZAP-70 expression). Real-time PCR assays to quantify either all hTERT transcripts (AT) or only the full length (FL) transcript encoding the functional protein were developed. hTERT-AT levels strongly correlated with hTERT-FT levels (r=0.743, P<0.0001); both inversely correlated with the percentage of IgVH mutation (P<0.005) and were significantly higher in unmutated than in mutated cases (P=0.004 and P=0.001, respectively). The hTERT values which best discriminated between the unmutated and mutated IgVH cases were 150 and 40 copies for hTERT-AT and hTERT-FL, respectively.

Unmutated cases with low hTERT levels had an overall survival close to mutated cases with high hTERT levels. Thus, this work identifies hTERT-RNA level as a new prognostic marker in B-CLL, and may be used to identify previously unrecognized patient groups with the same IgVH mutation status and different disease outcomes.","['Terrin, L', 'Trentin, L', 'Degan, M', 'Corradini, I', 'Bertorelle, R', 'Carli, P', 'Maschio, N', 'Bo, M D', 'Noventa, F', 'Gattei, V', 'Semenzato, G', 'De Rossi, A']","['Terrin L', 'Trentin L', 'Degan M', 'Corradini I', 'Bertorelle R', 'Carli P', 'Maschio N', 'Bo MD', 'Noventa F', 'Gattei V', 'Semenzato G', 'De Rossi A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):965-72. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404607.

To address this hypothesis in multiple myeloma (MM), we studied bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs), the only long-lived cells of the bone marrow microenvironment, by gene expression profiling and phenotypic and functional studies in three groups of individuals: patients with MM, patients with monoclonal gamopathy of undefined significance (MGUS) and healthy age-matched subjects. Gene expression profile independently classified the BMMSCs of these individuals in a normal and in an MM group. MGUS BMMSCs were interspersed between these two groups. Among the 145 distinct genes differentially expressed in MM and normal BMMSCs, 46% may account for a tumor-microenvironment cross-talk. Known soluble factors implicated in MM pathophysiologic features (i.e. IL (interleukin)-6, DKK1) were revealed and new ones were found which are involved in angiogenesis, osteogenic differentiation or tumor growth. In particular, GDF15 was found to induce dose-dependent growth of MOLP-6, a stromal cell-dependent myeloma cell line. Functionally, MM BMMSCs induced an overgrowth of MOLP-6, and their capacity to differentiate into an osteoblastic lineage was impaired. Thus, MM BMMSCs are abnormal and could create a very efficient niche to support the survival and proliferation of the myeloma cells.","['Corre, J', 'Mahtouk, K', 'Attal, M', 'Gadelorge, M', 'Huynh, A', 'Fleury-Cappellesso, S', 'Danho, C', 'Laharrague, P', 'Klein, B', 'Reme, T', 'Bourin, P']","['Corre J', 'Mahtouk K', 'Attal M', 'Gadelorge M', 'Huynh A', 'Fleury-Cappellesso S', 'Danho C', 'Laharrague P', 'Klein B', 'Reme T', 'Bourin P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,PMC2346535,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):1079-88. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404621.

This study explored the effects of fludarabine on HTLV-1-infected T cells (MT-1, -2, -4 and HUT102). Fludarabine induced growth arrest and apoptosis of these cells, as measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylithiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, cell cycle analysis and annexin V staining. Moreover, exposure of HTLV-1-infected T cells to fludarabine decreased the levels of X-inhibitor of apoptosis protein in conjunction with inhibition of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)/DNA-binding activity, as measured by Western blot analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift and reporter gene assays, respectively. Further studies found that fludarabine accumulated NF-kappaB and inhibitory subunit of NF-kappaB in cytosole in conjunction with downregulation of NF-kappaB in nucleus, suggesting that fludarabine blocked nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB.

It is possible that replicative exhaustion, owing to critical telomere shortening in hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), contributes to the development of cytopenias in these disorders. However to date, a direct link between the telomere length (TL) of human HPCs and their proliferative potential has not been demonstrated. In the present investigation, the TL and level of telomerase enzyme activity (TA) detected in cord blood (CB)-derived HPCs was found to predict erythroid expansion (P<0.01 and P=0.01 respectively). These results were corroborated by a correlation between proliferation of erythroid cells and telomere loss (P=0.01). In contrast, no correlations were found between initial TL, telomere loss or TA and the expansion of other myeloid lineage-committed cells. There was also no correlation between TL or TA and the number of clonogenic progenitors, including primitive progenitors derived from long-term culture. Our investigations revealed upregulation of telomerase to tumor cell levels in CD34- cells undergoing erythroid differentiation. Together, these results provide new insight into the regulation of TL and TA during myeloid cell expansion and demonstrate that TL is an important determinant of CB-derived erythroid cell proliferation.","['Schuller, C E', 'Jankowski, K', 'Mackenzie, K L']","['Schuller CE', 'Jankowski K', 'Mackenzie KL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):983-91. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404631.

These strategies have included the use of immunotherapy (interferon), novel agents (bortezomib, thalidomide, and lenalidomide), corticosteroids, and chemotherapy. While novel agents have had a major impact on response rates with initial therapy, most patients with multiple myeloma will eventually relapse. In the setting of minimal residual disease following standard dose or high-dose therapy, a number of different 'maintenance' strategies have emerged to prolong the duration of initial or subsequent remissions. The impact of these strategies on OS and event-free survival (EFS) is critically important, as the use of ineffective maintenance therapy adds the burden of additional cost, morbidity, and may reduce quality of life. Truly successful maintenance therapy will be effective in the setting of minimal residual disease, and will improve not only EFS, but also OS.

To identify cooperating oncogenic lesions, we performed a genome-wide analysis of leukaemic cells from 242 paediatric ALL patients using high-resolution, single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays and genomic DNA sequencing. Our analyses revealed deletion, amplification, point mutation and structural rearrangement in genes encoding principal regulators of B lymphocyte development and differentiation in 40% of B-progenitor ALL cases. The PAX5 gene was the most frequent target of somatic mutation, being altered in 31.7% of cases. The identified PAX5 mutations resulted in reduced levels of PAX5 protein or the generation of hypomorphic alleles. Deletions were also detected in TCF3 (also known as E2A), EBF1, LEF1, IKZF1 (IKAROS) and IKZF3 (AIOLOS). These findings suggest that direct disruption of pathways controlling B-cell development and differentiation contributes to B-progenitor ALL pathogenesis.

In HTLV-1 proviruses retaining both LTRs, 6-bp repeat sequences were adjacent to the 5' and 3' LTRs. In 8 of 12 cases with type 2 defective provirus, 6-bp repeats were identified at both ends. In five of these cases, a short repeat was bound to CA dinucleotides of the pol and env genes at the 5' end, suggesting that these type 2 defective proviruses were formed before integration. In four cases lacking the 6-bp repeat, short (6- to 26-bp) deletions in the host genome were identified, indicating that these defective proviruses were generated after integration. Quantification indicated frequencies of type 2 defective provirus of less than 3.9% for two carriers, which are much lower than those seen for ATL cases (27.8%). In type 2 defective proviruses, the second exons of the tax, rex, and p30 genes were frequently deleted, leaving Tax unable to activate NF-kappaB and CREB pathways.

Recently, comprehensive data about the structure and function of glycans have been accumulated, therefore the need for methods and algorithms to analyze these data is growing fast. RESULTS: This article presents novel methods for classifying glycans and detecting discriminative glycan motifs with support vector machines (SVM). We propose a new class of tree kernels to measure the similarity between glycans. These kernels are based on the comparison of tree substructures, and take into account several glycan features such as the sugar type, the sugar bound type or layer depth. The proposed methods are tested on their ability to classify human glycans into four blood components: leukemia cells, erythrocytes, plasma and serum. They are shown to outperform a previously published method. We also applied a feature selection approach to extract glycan motifs which are characteristic of each blood component. We confirmed that some leukemia-specific glycan motifs detected by our method corresponded to several results in the literature. AVAILABILITY: Softwares are available upon request.

Age-, sex-, and race-adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed, and proportional hazards models evaluated the effect of HAART use on cancer incidence and cancer survival time. Among 14,210 adults with AIDS diagnosed in 1990-2000, 482 non-AIDS-defining cancers were diagnosed. Compared with rates for the general population, significantly increased cancer incidence rates were observed for anal (SIR = 13.4), Hodgkin's lymphoma (SIR = 11.5), liver (SIR = 3.6), oral cavity and pharynx (SIR = 2.6), respiratory (SIR = 2.6), leukemia (SIR = 2.4), skin melanoma (SIR = 2.4), and prostate (SIR = 1.7) cancers. Risk of liver cancer was lower with HAART use (relative hazard (RH) = 0.32). Risk of anal cancer increased after 1995 (RH = 2.9). Respiratory cancer (RH = 0.40) and Hodgkin's lymphoma (RH = 0.17) showed increased cancer survival time with HAART use, while anal cancer survival may have been slightly decreased (RH = 1.4).

The viral regulatory protein Tax plays a central role in leukemogenesis as a transcriptional transactivator of both viral and cellular gene expression, and this requires Tax activity in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. In the present study, we have investigated the mechanisms involved in the nuclear localization of Tax. Employing a GFP fusion expression system and a range of Tax mutants, we could confirm that the N-terminal 60 amino acids, and specifically residues within the zinc finger motif in this region, are important for nuclear localization. Using an in vitro nuclear import assay, it could be demonstrated that the transportation of Tax to the nucleus required neither energy nor carrier proteins. Specific and direct binding between Tax and p62, a nucleoporin with which the importin beta family of proteins have been known to interact was also observed. The nuclear import activity of wild type Tax and its mutants and their binding affinity for p62 were also clearly correlated, suggesting that the entry of Tax into the nucleus involves a direct interaction with nucleoporins within the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The nuclear export of Tax was also shown to be carrier independent.

These studies suggest that Tax could alter the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of cellular proteins, and this could contribute to the deregulation of cellular processes observed in HTLV-1 infection.","['Tsuji, Takahiro', 'Sheehy, Noreen', 'Gautier, Virginie W', 'Hayakawa, Hitoshi', 'Sawa, Hirofumi', 'Hall, William W']","['Tsuji T', 'Sheehy N', 'Gautier VW', 'Hayakawa H', 'Sawa H', 'Hall WW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 May 4;282(18):13875-83. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M611629200.

According to current results, the frequency of Val617Phe activating mutation is around 80% in polycythaemia vera, 35% in essential thrombocythemia, and 50% in chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis. The diagnoses of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and idiopathic myelofibrosis were so far based on the exclusion of secondary factors as well as bone marrow biopsy histology. The goal of the present work was to establish simple molecular genetic techniques for the routine testing of Janus kinase 2 gene Val617Phe mutation, and to compare the clinical phenotypes of Val617Phe mutation positive and negative myeloproliferative syndromes. We employed the allele specific polymerase chain technique for detection of Val617Phe mutation in 252 patients with myeloproliferative syndrome. We measured Val617Phe frequency as 85,4% (117/137) in polycythemia vera, 56,6% (56/99) in essential thrombocythemia, and 87,5% (14/16) in idiopathic myelofibrosis. We found significantly elevated hemoglobin levels and white blood cell counts (measured at the time of diagnosis) in Val617Phe-positive polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia patient groups compared to Val617Phe-negative patients. However, the frequencies of splenomegaly and other complications (thrombosis, bleeding, transformation to acute leukemia) were not significantly different between the mutation-positive and negative groups. In conclusion, the non-invasive mutation analysis of the Janus kinase 2 Val617Phe is suitable for routine laboratory application and helps the differential diagnosis of myeloproliferative syndrome. Although the exact role of Val617Phe mutation testing has not yet been identified on the basis of a broad professional consensus, the testing is suggested in cases of erythrocytoses and thrombocytoses of unknown origin.","['Andrikovics, Hajnalka', 'Szilvasi, Aniko', 'Meggyesi, Nora', 'Kiraly, Viktoria', 'Halm, Gabriella', 'Lueff, Sandor', 'Nahajevszky, Sarolta', 'Mikala, Gabor', 'Sipos, Andrea', 'Lovas, Nora', 'Csukly, Zoltan', 'Matrai, Zoltan', 'Tamaska, Julia', 'Tordai, Attila', 'Masszi, Tamas']","['Andrikovics H', 'Szilvasi A', 'Meggyesi N', 'Kiraly V', 'Halm G', 'Lueff S', 'Nahajevszky S', 'Mikala G', 'Sipos A', 'Lovas N', 'Csukly Z', 'Matrai Z', 'Tamaska J', 'Tordai A', 'Masszi T']",['hun'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/06/02 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2007 Feb 4;148(5):203-10. doi: 10.1556/OH.2007.27860.,"['47E5O17Y3R (Phenylalanine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'HG18B9YRS7 (Valine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Frequency', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/enzymology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylalanine', '*Point Mutation', 'Polycythemia Vera/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics', 'Thrombocytosis/genetics', 'Valine']","['C758T63311G46Q70 [pii]', '10.1556/OH.2007.27860 [doi]']",,"['Orszagos Gyogyintezeti Kozpont, Molekularis Diagnosztikai Osztaly, Budapest, Hungary. andrikovics@kkk.org.hu']",,A 2-es tipusu Janus tirozin kinaz Val617Phe aktivalo pontmutacio szerepe es kimutatasanak jelentosege myeloproliferativ szindromaban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Female OFCD patients suffer from severe ocular, craniofacial, cardiac, and digital developmental defects and males do not survive through gestation. BCOR can mediate transcriptional repression by the oncoprotein BCL6 and has the ability to reduce transcriptional activation by AF9, a known mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) fusion partner. The essential role of BCOR in development and its ability to modulate activity of known oncogenic proteins prompted us to determine the expression profile of Bcor during mouse development. Identification of independently transcribed exons in the 5' untranslated region of Bcor suggests that three independent promoters control the expression of Bcor in mice. Although Bcor is widely expressed in adult mouse tissues, analysis of known spliced isoforms in the coding region of Bcor reveals differential isoform usage. Whole mount in situ hybridization of mouse embryos shows that Bcor is strongly expressed in the extraembryonic tissue during gastrulation and expression significantly increases throughout the embryo after embryonic turning. During organogenesis and fetal stages Bcor is differentially expressed in multiple tissue lineages, with a notable presence in the developing nervous system. Strikingly, we observed that Bcor expression in the eye, brain, neural tube, and branchial arches correlates with tissues affected in OFCD patients.","['Wamstad, Joseph A', 'Bardwell, Vivian J']","['Wamstad JA', 'Bardwell VJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Netherlands,Gene Expr Patterns,Gene expression patterns : GEP,101167473,PMC2002546,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/07/31 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/11/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/04 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/31 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Expr Patterns. 2007 Apr;7(5):550-7. doi: 10.1016/j.modgep.2007.01.006.

Several pathways have been implicated in resistance to viral infection in IFN-treated cells, one of which implicates the ProMyelocytic Leukaemia (PML) protein and PML nuclear bodies (NBs, also known as ND10). PML NBs are dynamic intranuclear structures that require PML for their formation and which harbour numerous other transiently or permanently localised proteins. PML is expressed as a family of isoforms (PML I-VII) as a result of alternative splicing, most of which are found in the nucleus. IFN treatment directly induces transcription of the genes encoding both PML and Sp100, (another major component of PML NBs), resulting in higher levels of expression of these proteins and increases in both the size and number of PML NBs. These and other observations have encouraged the hypothesis that PML, PML NBs and a number of other constituents of these structures are involved in host antiviral defences. For example, exogenous expression of PML III or PML VI can impede infection by a number of RNA and DNA viruses, and certain viral proteins accumulate in PML NBs then cause their disruption by a variety of mechanisms. Although there are many other functions of PML NBs in a wide range of cellular pathways, there is accumulating evidence that they represent preferential targets for viral infections and that PML plays a role in the mechanism of the antiviral action of IFN. This article reviews the potential antiviral activities of PML NB constituent proteins, how RNA and DNA viruses overcome these defences, and the connections between these events and IFN pathways.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K']","['Everett RD', 'Chelbi-Alix MK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Biochimie,Biochimie,1264604,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochimie. 2007 Jun-Jul;89(6-7):819-30. doi: 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.01.004.

While previous studies of Fv1 restriction involving N- and B-tropic murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) had demonstrated that the identity of a single amino acid residue at CA110 (arginine vs. glutamic acid) determines whether the resulting virus is N (arg) or B-tropic (glu), analogous studies of dual-tropic MLVs, such as Moloney MLV (Mo-MLV), have shown that additional residues other than CA110 are also involved in the specification of dual-tropic host range. Here we have further studied the CA determinants of Mo-MLV host range, with an emphasis on identifying additional CA residues and unique combinations of CA residues which differentially influence the ability of the resulting virus to infect murine and human cells. First, we show that CA82, a residue previously identified to affect the pattern of Fv1 restriction of different MLV viruses in murine cells, is a particularly strong potentiator of B-tropism in an Mo-MLV background carrying a glutamic acid residue at CA110 (A110E substitution), and that interestingly, different residues at CA82 lead to distinct patterns of restriction in human but not in murine cells. We also identify another CA residue, CA214, as a similarly potent potentiator of B-tropism, in the context of the A110E substitution. While another substitution at CA110, A110R, leads to strong potentiation of N-tropism in murine cells, in the absence of additional mutations, we found that A110R alone was not sufficient to confer appreciable restriction in Ref1-expressing cells, despite the fact that authentic N-MLV shows strong restriction in those cells. In conjunction with the A110R substitution, substitutions at CA82, but not at CA214, do lead to significant restriction in human cells, thus demonstrating a distinction between the interactions between those two determinants of restriction and CA110. Finally, using cell lines engineered to express the TRIM5alpha(hu) gene product, recently identified as the Ref1 restriction factor, and RNAi technology to knock-down expression of TRIM5alpha(hu) in human cells, we directly demonstrate that the unique patterns of restriction observed in human cells with the different mutants are consistent with a TRIM5alpha(hu)-mediated restriction. These studies shed further light on the complex determinants within the viral CA gene product which control the susceptibility of murine and human cells to retroviral infection.","['Ulm, J Wesley', 'Perron, Michel', 'Sodroski, Joseph', 'C Mulligan, Richard']","['Ulm JW', 'Perron M', 'Sodroski J', 'C Mulligan R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/07/07 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2006/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2006/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2006/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 2007 Jul 5;363(2):245-55. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2006.09.048.

METHODS: Bone marrow samples from 112 adult AL patients were prepared by short-term (24 hours) unstimulated culture, and karyotyped by R-banding. The abnormal signals were screened by interphase- fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with dual-color break-apart 11 q23/MLL-specific probe, and the 11 q23/MLL gene rearrangements were determined by metaphase-FISH. RESULTS: Of the 112 patients,9 (8. 0%) with 11q23/MLL translocations were revealed by FISH, among which only 4 (3. 6% ) was revealed by CCA. Three patients were reported by CCA to have del( 11) ( q23) , while by FISH assay two of them were 11 q23/MLL translocation and one was true deletion of I lq23 telomeric terminus. Furthermore by FISH assay II q23/MLL translocations were identified in one each patient with normal karyotype, with 11 q + and without overt 11 q23 abnormality. Eight patients with MLL gene amplification including polysome, homogenous staining region (hsr) and double minute chromosome (dmin) were also disclosed by FISH. AL patients with 11 q23/MLL abnormalities were frequently diagnosed as pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pro-B ALL) ,acute monocytic leukemia (AMoL) or biphenotypic acute leukemia (BAL). CONCLUSION: FISH with dual-color break-apart I q23/MLL -specific probe is a rapid and sensitive method to detect 11 q23/MLL abnormalities, as compared with CCA. FISH also effectively discloses translocations and amplifications involving 11 q23/MLL,and should be performed in patients diagnosed as pro-B ALL,AMoL or BAL, with CCA normal karyotype.","['Zhao, Xi-chen', 'Li, Cheng-wen', 'Dai, Yun', 'Liu, Xu-ping', 'Qin, Shuang', 'Liu, Shi-he', 'Mi, Ying-chang', 'Wang, Jian-xiang']","['Zhao XC', 'Li CW', 'Dai Y', 'Liu XP', 'Qin S', 'Liu SH', 'Mi YC', 'Wang JX']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,,2007/03/09 09:00,2007/09/01 09:00,['2007/03/09 09:00'],"['2007/03/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/09 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2006 Oct;27(10):682-6.,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Interphase/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, CAMS & PUMC, Tianjin 300020, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Routine G banding chromosome analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization( FISH) were performed on lymph node specimens from 155 NHL patients. RESULTS: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma( DLBCL) constituted 38.1% of the cases followed by follicular lymphoma(FL) 17.4% , small lymphocytic lymphoma( SLL) 10.3% , peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL) ( unspecified) 8.4%, and angioimmunoblastic lymphoma 7.1%. One hundred nineteen patients (76. 8%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The incidence of chromosomal abnormalities among FL, SLL, DLBCL, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) and precursor T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (TLBL) was 96.3% , 87.5% , 86.4%, 83.3% and 83.3%, respectively. Complex karyotype was 86. 3% in DLBCL. The most frequent structural abnormalities in DLBCL involved chromosomes 3, 6, 14 and 1, with had high frequencies of 3q27 (41.2%) and 6q21, 6q23, 6q25 involvement (23.5%).

A narrative approach for children with cancer.,xvi-xxiii,"In troublesome situations, each of us uses verbal communication carefully, at times diminishing our meaning with words of little significance. However, since the need to communicate remains a part of us, body language or other forms of expression are put into use. Inside a hospital a child is always a stranger with regards to the uneasiness that accompanies his/her experience. Because diagnostic and therapeutic ends are the primary concern of the health care professionals, there is often little sign of affection in their impersonal gestures, glances and body language. Graphic and pictorial communication, therefore, hold great importance for sick children since this is an area they have easier access to, and that they cultivate at school and through play. This activity fulfills their innate need to communicate with themselves and with others. Children express themselves through drawings, using them as a stage to dramatize their needs, wishes anxieties, and joys. When in hospital, children are afraid, and they feel embarrassed around strangers and even parents, especially when the parents are speaking with their caregivers. The children are afraid of making a poor impression and of being rejected by adults, of being considered inadequate and untruthful. Their need for truth and for communication unfolds through artistic expression, and this is the basis of art therapy. The opportunity to express themselves through drawings is what makes the ill child his/her won therapeutic agent through a self-healing mechanism. This may be further guided so as to lead to an increase in self-esteem, which in turn will lead to both enhancement of their full expressive possibilities and to positive feedback of their self-image. In addition to verbal language itself, art therapy is the preferred and ideal means to communicate following the rules of ""narrative-based medicine"", and to understand children. In this study spontaneous drawings of 50 Italian children affected by leukemia or cancer in different stages were evaluated during 2003 at the outpatient clinic of G. Gaslini Children's Hospital. Ages ranged from 4 to 14 years (median 8 years); 27 were males and 23 females. They drew in three situations: spontaneously when they were alone; with play workers; and with the psychologist. Pictures emerging from these settings have proven to be significant and denote the children's perception of the disease, and of their fears and hopes. The children's drawings allowed them to depict their present and future relationship with the disease, with the hospital, and with the environment in general. Their pictures reflected not only their current state of mind, but also past experiences and future prospects. Art therapy proved to be a vitally important means of ""narrative"" communication for severely sick children in hospital. Thus, collecting and evaluating drawings in an attempt to establish the intellectual, cultural, and emotional status of each child is of paramount importance. To this end, workers have been trained to carefully observe ech child while drawing. Such extremely important collaboration prevents the loss of relevant and vital details. This research confirms our theory that art therapy has to be included in the total care of a severely ill child while in hospital. Drawings accompanied by comments certainly provide a broader approach to better understanding the child's anxiety and feelings.","['Massimo, Luisa M', 'Zarri, Daniela A']","['Massimo LM', 'Zarri DA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Nov;1089:xvi-xxiii. doi: 10.1196/annals.1386.020.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Art Therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/psychology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology', 'Stress, Psychological/therapy']",['10.1196/annals.1386.020 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood of the patients was taken before and 1 h after the first fraction of whole body irradiation (2 Gy). Blood samples of the volunteers were irradiated ex vivo with 2 Gy. After Ficoll-Paque density gradient centrifugation telomerase activity of 10(4) PBMC per sample was measured using the telomerase PCR ELISA method. No age-dependence of telomerase activity was detected for both the volunteer and the patient group. Telomerase activity in patients was not statistically significantly increased compared to healthy individuals, and this parameter was also no prognostic factor for patient survival. After whole body irradiation an induction of telomerase activity was observed for only 7 patients (28%), or in PBMC of 2 volunteers (13%), respectively. In patients with radiation-inducible telomerase activity, a slightly better survival was indicated, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

Alterations in the MGMT gene may result in an increase in the mutation rate and risk of malignant transformation. We have previously shown that MGMT is implicated in colorectal carcinogenesis particularly in cancers which display microsatellite instability, a marker of impaired DNA repair. The aims of the current study were to assess the roles of MGMT and microsatellite instability in hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) from Australia and South Africa. DNA was extracted from malignant and non-malignant liver tissue from 37 Australian and 24 South African patients, and histologically normal liver from 20 transplant donors. MGMT promoter hypermethylation and MGMT protein expression were assessed using methylation specific PCR and immunohistochemistry. Microsatellite instability was examined using a panel of 23 microsatellite markers previously used to detect allelic imbalance and two specific markers for the detection of low levels of microsatellite instability. Methylation specific PCR did not detect any methylation of the MGMT promoter in Australian and South African HCCs. Similarly, no hypermethylation of MGMT was observed in the adjacent non-malignant liver or histologically normal liver. MGMT staining was predominantly nuclear with some cytoplasmic staining. Overexpression of MGMT protein was detected in 14 (39%) HCCs, while a reduction in protein expression was evident in 14 (39%) HCCs. In the remaining 8 cases the expression of MGMT was comparable in HCCs and adjacent non-malignant tissue. Interestingly, MGMT expression decreased relative to adjacent non-malignant liver tissue in patients who had aetiologies other than viral hepatitis for their underlying liver diseases (p<0.02). No microsatellite instability was detected in this series of 61 HCCs. This suggests that epigenetic silencing of MGMT and microsatellite instability does not play an important role in this series of HCCs derived from different populations.","['Herath, Nirmitha I', 'Walsh, Michael D', 'Kew, Michael', 'Smith, Jeffery L', 'Jass, Jeremy R', 'Young, Joanne', 'Leggett, Barbara A', 'Macdonald, Graeme A']","['Herath NI', 'Walsh MD', 'Kew M', 'Smith JL', 'Jass JR', 'Young J', 'Leggett BA', 'Macdonald GA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Apr;17(4):817-22.,['EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Australia', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', '*Gene Silencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Middle Aged', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'South Africa']",,,"['Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Qld 4029, Australia. nirmithH@qimr.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is one of the diagnostic tools employed for the detection of PML/RARalpha rearrangement. Using a dual color dual fusion (D-FISH) PML/RARalpha translocation DNA probe which hybridises both to PML/RARalpha and RARalpha/PML fusion genes, we characterised the FISH pattern of 52 APL patients at diagnosis and correlated the findings with conventional cytogenetics and RT-PCR analysis. The diagnostic sensitivity of the probe for PML/RARalpha was 100%. Seven patients had atypical D-FISH patterns; two had a masked PML/RARalpha fusion signal caused by the insertion of PML into RARalpha on 17q; 3 had an extra copy of PML/RARalpha in the form of isochromosome der(17)(q10)t(15;17) and one had duplication of the normal RARalpha gene with an ider(17q) masquerading as i(17)(q10). There was also one case of t(7;17;15) with a typical D-FISH pattern and in which metaphase FISH suggested an unusual 4-point break. In summary, PML/RARalpha D-FISH is a highly sensitive method for confirming diagnosis of APL. However D-FISH cannot be solely relied on for the diagnosis of APL owing to atypical patterns which are infrequently observed in cases with additional 17q structural abnormalities, gene insertion and gene duplication.","['Wan, Thomas S K', 'So, Chi-Chiu', 'Hui, Koon-Chun', 'Yip, Sze-Fai', 'Ma, Edmond S K', 'Chan, Li-Chong']","['Wan TS', 'So CC', 'Hui KC', 'Yip SF', 'Ma ES', 'Chan LC']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2007 Apr;17(4):799-805.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA Probes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,"['Hematology Division, Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, P.R.

To further characterize the molecular mechanisms by which beta1 integrins confer radiation and chemoresistance, HL60 human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells stably transfected with beta1 integrin and A3 Jurkat T-lymphoma cells deficient for Fas-associated death domain protein or procaspase-8 were examined. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Upon exposure to X-rays, Ara-C or FasL, suspension and adhesion (fibronectin (FN), laminin, collagen-1; 5-100 microg/cm(2) coating concentration) cultures were processed for measurement of apoptosis, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), caspase activation, and protein analysis. Overexpression of beta1 integrins enhanced the cellular sensitivity to X-rays and Ara-C, which was counteracted by increasing concentrations of matrix proteins in association with reduced caspase-3 and -8 activation and MTP breakdown. Usage of stimulatory or inhibitory anti beta1 integrin antibodies, pharmacological caspase or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, coprecipitation experiments and siRNA-mediated beta1 integrin silencing provided further data showing an interaction between FN-ligated beta1 integrin and PI3K/Akt for inhibiting procaspase-8 cleavage. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The presented data suggest that the ligand status of beta1 integrins is critical for their antiapoptotic effect in leukemia cells treated with Ara-C, FasL or ionizing radiation. The antiapoptotic actions involve formation of a beta1 integrin/Akt complex, which signals to prevent procaspase-8-mediated induction of apoptosis in a PI3K-dependent manner. Antagonizing agents targeting beta1 integrin and PI3K/Akt signaling in conjunction with conventional therapies might effectively reduce radiation- and drug-resistant tumor populations and treatment failure in hematological malignancies.","['Estrugo, Doris', 'Fischer, Alexander', 'Hess, Franziska', 'Scherthan, Harry', 'Belka, Claus', 'Cordes, Nils']","['Estrugo D', 'Fischer A', 'Hess F', 'Scherthan H', 'Belka C', 'Cordes N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,PMC1800908,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/03/08 09:01,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:01 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2007 Mar 7;2(3):e269. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000269.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin beta Chains)', '0 (Laminin)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,,"['*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Collagen/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fibronectins/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Integrin beta Chains/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects', 'Laminin/pharmacology', '*Radiation Protection', 'X-Rays']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0000269 [doi]'],,"['Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology, Munich, Germany.']",,,20070307,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070725'],,

It has been identified as a by-product of fermentation in foods and has been detected in mainstream and sidestream tobacco smoke. 4-Methylimidazole was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for a long-term study because of the high potential for human exposure. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 4-methylimidazole (99.5% pure) in feed for 2 years. Fifteen-day and 14-week toxicity studies of 4-methylimidazole in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice are reported in NTP Toxicity Report No. 67. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, rat and mouse bone marrow cells, and mouse peripheral blood. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were fed diets containing 0, 625, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm 4-methylimidazole (males) or 0, 1,250, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm 4-methylimidazole (females) (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 30, 55, or 115 mg 4-methylimidazole/kg body weight to males and 60, 120, or 260 mg/kg to females) for 106 weeks. Survival of all exposed groups of male and female rats was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of males in the 1,250 and 2,500 ppm groups and females in the 2,500 and 5,000 ppm groups were less than those of the control groups throughout the study; mean body weights of 1,250 ppm females were less after week 41. Feed consumption by 5,000 ppm females was less than that by the controls. Clonic seizures, excitability, hyperactivity, and impaired gait were observed primarily in 2,500 and 5,000 ppm females. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in 5,000 ppm females was significantly greater than that in the controls, and the incidence exceeded the historical range in feed study controls. The incidences of hepatic histiocytosis, chronic inflammation, and focal fatty change were generally significantly increased in all exposed groups of male and female rats. The incidences of hepatocellular eosinophilic and mixed cell focus were significantly increased in 2,500 ppm males and 5,000 ppm females. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were fed diets containing 0, 312, 625, or 1,250 ppm 4-methylimidazole (equivalent to average daily doses of approximately 40, 80, and 170 mg 4-methylimidazole/kg body weight to males and females) for 106 weeks. Survival of all exposed groups of male and female mice was similar to that of the control groups. Mean body weights of males and females in the 1,250 ppm groups were less than those of the control groups after weeks 17 and 12, respectively. Mean body weights of 312 and 625 ppm females were less after weeks 85 and 65, respectively. Feed consumption by exposed groups of male and female mice was generally similar to that by the controls. The incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma in all exposed groups of females, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinoma in 1,250 ppm males, and alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma or carcinoma (combined) in 1,250 ppm males and 625 and 1,250 ppm females were significantly greater than those in the control groups. The incidence of alveolar epithelium hyperplasia was significantly increased in 1,250 ppm females. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: 4-Methylimidazole was not mutagenic in the S. typhimurium mutation assay when tested in strains TA97, TA98, TA100, and TA1535, with and without hamster or rat liver metabolic activation enzymes. No consistent or significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated erythrocytes were seen in the bone marrow of male rats or mice treated with 4-methylimidazole by intraperitoneal injection, or in peripheral blood samples from male and female mice administered the compound in dosed feed for 14 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-methylimidazole in male F344/N rats exposed to 625, 1,250, or 2,500 ppm. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-methylimidazole in female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 4-methylimidazole in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms.

This situation will likely continue unless experience with AML is reported from different institutions in the Kingdom. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, the records of 52 adult patients with previously untreated de novo acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who were treated at King Khalid University Hospital over a five-year period from January 1989 to December 1993 according to the conventional a3+7a regimen were reviewed. The clinical features of the disease, response to therapy and treatment-related complications were identified. RESULTS: There were 33 males and 19 females with a mean age of 30+/-13 years (mean+/-SD). M 4 and M 5 AML were the predominant French-American-British (FAB) subtypes encountered. Sixty-five percent of patients achieved complete remission (CR). The median duration of the first CR of all analyzable patients was 32 weeks. The median CR duration and survival of patients achieving complete remission who survived through their consolidation treatment was 36 and 49 weeks, respectively. CONCLUSION: Both median duration of the first complete remission and survival compare unfavorably with those reported in the literature despite a comparable remission rate. Infectious complications were frequent and accounted for a significant number of mortalities.","['Harakati, M S', 'Al-Momen, A M', 'Ajarim, D S', 'Al-Moharib, F I', 'Al-Theyab, A', 'Fawzy, E M', 'Al-Gwaiz, L', 'Al-Khairy, K S']","['Harakati MS', 'Al-Momen AM', 'Ajarim DS', 'Al-Moharib FI', 'Al-Theyab A', 'Fawzy EM', 'Al-Gwaiz L', 'Al-Khairy KS']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/03/08 09:01,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/08 09:01 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 1998 May-Jun;18(3):221-5. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.1998.221.,,,,,"['18-221 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.1998.221 [doi]']",,"['Departments of Medicine and Pathology, King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The UK Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS) provides a large and unique source of information on residential magnetic field exposure in the UK. The purpose of this supplementary study was to investigate a sample of UKCCS homes in order to identify the particular sources that contribute to elevated time-averaged exposure. In all, 196 homes have been investigated, 102 with exposures estimated on the basis of the original study to be above 0.2 microT, and 21 higher than 0.4 microT, a threshold above which a raised risk has been observed. First, surveys were carried out outside the property boundaries of all 196 study homes, and then, where informed consent had been obtained, assessments were conducted inside the properties of 19 homes. The study found that low-voltage (LV) sources associated with the final electricity supply accounted together for 77% of exposures above 0.2 microT, and 57% of those above 0.4 microT. Most of these exposures were linked to net currents in circuits inside and/or around the home. High-voltage (HV) sources, including the HV overhead power lines that are the focus of public concern, accounted for 23% of the exposures above 0.2 microT, and 43% of those above 0.4 microT. Public health interest has focused on the consideration of precautionary measures that would reduce exposure to power frequency magnetic fields. Our study provides a basis for considering the options for exposure mitigation in the UK. For instance, in elevated-exposure homes where net currents are higher than usual, if it is possible to reduce the net currents, then the exposure could be reduced for a sizeable proportion of these homes. Further investigations would be necessary to determine whether this is feasible.","['Maslanyj, M P', 'Mee, T J', 'Renew, D C', 'Simpson, J', 'Ansell, P', 'Allen, S G', 'Roman, E']","['Maslanyj MP', 'Mee TJ', 'Renew DC', 'Simpson J', 'Ansell P', 'Allen SG', 'Roman E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/06/01 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/01 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2007 Mar;27(1):41-58. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/27/1/002.

We compared natural killer (NK) cytolytic function in 48 MDS patients with 37 healthy donors and found reduced activity in the patient population (K562 cytolysis, 19% +/- 21% SD versus 40% +/- 17%) (P < .001). NK cytotoxicity in MDS patients was reduced against 3 disparate tumor targets with differential activating receptor requirement, suggesting global defects in NK function. Reduced NK function in MDS was significantly associated with higher International Prognostic Score (P = .01), abnormal karyotype (P = .05), the presence of excess blasts (P = .01), and age-adjusted bone marrow hypercellularity (P = .04). MDS patients had a display of the activating receptor NKp30, and NKG2D down-regulation closely correlated with impaired NK function (P = .001). NKG2D ligands (MICA and MICB) were expressed on CD34(+) cells from bone marrow of 30% of MDS patients and a leukemic cell line derived from an MDS patient (MDS1). Collectively, these findings suggest that impairment of NK cytolytic function derives in part from reduced activating NK receptors such as NKG2D in association with disease progression. Evasion of NK immunosurveillance may have importance for MDS disease progression.","['Epling-Burnette, Pearlie K', 'Bai, Fanqi', 'Painter, Jeffrey S', 'Rollison, Dana E', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Krusch, Matthias', 'Zou, Jianxiang', 'Ku, Edna', 'Zhong, Bin', 'Boulware, David', 'Moscinski, Lynn', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Djeu, Julie Y', 'List, Alan F']","['Epling-Burnette PK', 'Bai F', 'Painter JS', 'Rollison DE', 'Salih HR', 'Krusch M', 'Zou J', 'Ku E', 'Zhong B', 'Boulware D', 'Moscinski L', 'Wei S', 'Djeu JY', 'List AF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1885518,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 1;109(11):4816-24. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-07-035519.

This clinical trial enrolled 416 patients with AML aged 65 years or older who were considered eligible for standard intensive chemotherapy, with a first randomization comparing idarubicin with daunorubicin for all treatment sequences. After induction, an ambulatory postremission strategy based on 6 consolidation cycles administered monthly in outpatients was randomly compared with an intensive strategy with a single intensive consolidation course similar to induction. Complete remission (CR) rate was 57% with 10% induction deaths, and estimated overall survival was 27% at 2 years and 12% at 4 years, without notable differences between anthracycline arms. Among the 236 patients who reached CR, 164 (69%) were randomized for the postremission comparison. In these patients, the multivariate odds ratio in favor of the ambulatory arm was 1.51 for disease-free survival (P.05) and 1.59 for overall survival from CR (P.04). Despite repeated courses of chemotherapy associated with a longer time under treatment, the ambulatory arm was associated with significantly shorter rehospitalization duration and lower red blood cell unit and platelet transfusion requirements than observed in the intensive arm.

Such systems gave the unique opportunity to perform in vitro investigations of transcription and translation, cell growth, biochemistry and mechanics of healthy normal organs as well as those affected by malignant tumors, infections, and immune deficiency under controlled conditions. In rotating vessel bioreactors under microgravity and defined medium content, cells proliferate, stay abundant to each other, and form three-dimensional structures, assigned as spheroids. Such spheroids might be grown on microcarriers. A wide spectrum of different cell culture experiments involving normal and transformed human cells indicates that: in the rotating bioreactor system miniPERM no complete lack of gravity could be reached; a great part of the seeded cell material does not proliferate at the beginning; and the appearance of bigger spheroids is rather random. We describe the acquisition of spheroids from HD-MY-Z and Neuro-2A tumor cells. Spheroids of 100 and more cells were obtained from HD-MY-Z and Neuro-2A cells. Interestingly, chronic myeloid leukemia LAMA-84 cells did not form any cell clumps and they kept a completely undifferentiated phenotype despite their semiadherent manner of growth under conventional conditions.

In MOLT-4 cells (human T lymphocyte leukemia) the cell cycle arrest is caused by 2 mM VA, while 4 mM VA induces mainly apoptosis. In our work we studied effect of VA on molecular mechanisms responsible for cell cycle arrest (2 mM VA) or apoptosis induction (4 mM VA). The aim of our article was to evaluate a cotreatment by low (cytostatic) concentrations of VA with ionizing radiation and an effect of this combination on apoptosis induction in tumor cells MOLT-4. We prove that 24-h long incubation with VA causes acetylation of histones H3 and H4 in concentration-dependent manners. During first hours after the beginning of cultivation with VA in both studied concentrations (2 and 4 mM) an increase of p53 and its phosphorylation on serine 392 is detected, as well as a phosphorylation of Mdm2 on serine 166. After 8 and 24 h after the beginning of cultivation with 2 mM VA we detect p21, which is not observed after exposure to 4 mM VA. Cleavage of lamin B to 46 kDa fragment as an indicator of apoptosis was apparent after 24-h long incubation with 4 mM VA. In this article we prove radiosensitizing effect of VA. After 3-days long cultivation of cells with 2 mM VA the D(0) value decreased from 0.7 to 0.2 Gy. Also the EC70 value fell from 0.97 to 0.38 mM when the cells were irradiated with a dose of 1 Gy before the continual cultivation with VA.

In this article, we examined in vitro effects of FK228 on human leukemia cell lines, NB4 and HL-60. FK228 alone (0.2-1 ng/mL) inhibited leukemia cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and induced death by apoptosis. FK228 had selective differentiating effects on two cell lines when used for 6 h before induction of granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) or in combination with RA. These effects were accompanied by a time- and dose-dependent histone H4 hyper-acetylation or histone H3 dephosphorylation and alterations in DNA binding of NF-kappaB in association with cell death and differentiation. Pifithrin-alpha (PFT), an inhibitor of p53 transcriptional activity, protected only NB4 cells with functional p53 from FK228-induced apoptosis and did not interfere with antiproliferative activity in p53-negative HL-60 cells. In NB4 cells, PFT inhibited p53 binding to the p21 (Waf1/Cip1) promotor and induced DNA binding of NF-kappaB leading to enhanced cell survival. Thus, beneficial effects of FK228 on human promyelocytic leukemia may be exerted through the induction of differentiation or apoptosis via histone modification and selective involvement of transcription factors, such as NF-kappaB and p53.","['Savickiene, Jurate', 'Treigyte, Grazina', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta', 'Magnusson, Karl-Eric']","['Savickiene J', 'Treigyte G', 'Borutinskaite V', 'Navakauskiene R', 'Magnusson KE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/03/29 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 2006 Dec;1091:368-84. doi: 10.1196/annals.1378.081.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'CX3T89XQBK (romidepsin)']",IM,,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Depsipeptides/*pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*physiology']","['1091/1/368 [pii]', '10.1196/annals.1378.081 [doi]']",,"['Department of Developmental Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, LT-08662 Vilnius, Lithuania. jurate_savickiene@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated that the HDACI combinations exert different effects on cell cycle arrest and differentiation as determined by nitro blue reduction and the expression of the early myeloid differentiation marker CD11b. The most beneficial effects were found by use of 6-h pretreatment with PB and vitamin B3 before the exposition to RA alone or in combination with vitamin B3, showing significant acceleration and a high level of granulocytic differentiation. The effects were associated with a rapid histone H4 acetylation and later histone H3 modifications.

Both drugs inhibited autocrine- and cytokine-dependent proliferation of primary AML blasts when tested at nanomolar levels (0.1-100 nmol/l). The antiproliferative effect was independent of basal chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity (showing a 20-fold variation between patients), genetic abnormalities, morphological differentiation and CD34 expression when testing a large group of consecutive patients (n = 54). The effect was retained in cocultures with bone marrow stromal cells. In addition, both drugs enhanced apoptosis. The effect of PR-171 could be detected at lower concentrations than for bortezomib, especially when testing the influence on clonogenic AML cell proliferation. Both drugs had divergent effects on AML cells' constitutive cytokine release. Furthermore, both drugs caused a decrease in proliferation and viability when tested in combination with idarubicin or cytarabine. An antiproliferative effect on primary human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells was also detected.

However, it may be accompanied by graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reaction contributing to decreased risk of relapse. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of cGVHD on outcome of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients treated with alloHCT. Fifty-five ALL patients, aged 24 (18-54) years, who survived without progression at least 100 days after alloHCT from HLA-identical sibling (n = 40, 73%) or an unrelated volunteer (n = 15, 27%) were included in the analysis. 24 patients 44% were given alloHCT in first complete remission, whereas the remaining 31 patients (44%) were in more advanced disease. The probability of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) equaled 57% and 48% at 8 years, respectively. Cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality (NRM) was 39% and 13%, respectively. OS rate equaled 51% for patients without cGVHD, 94% for patients with limited cGVHD, and 38% for those with extensive cGVHD. In the respective subgroups relapse incidence was 60%, 9% and 0%, whereas the incidence of NRM equaled 3%, 6% and 62%. In multivariate analysis the lack of cGVHD was the most important factor associated with increased risk of relapse and deteriorated DFS. Extensive, but not limited cGVHD was associated with increased risk of NMR. Our findings confirm that in adults with ALL, cGVHD is accompanied by a strong GVL reaction. Induction of limited cGVHD may constitute the most effective prophylaxis of relapse in this group of patients.","['Wojnar, Jerzy', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Holowiecka-Goral, Aleksandra', 'Krawczyk-Kulis, Malgorzata', 'Markiewicz, Miroslaw', 'Stella-Holowiecka, Beata', 'Wylezol, Iwona']","['Wojnar J', 'Giebel S', 'Holowiecka-Goral A', 'Krawczyk-Kulis M', 'Markiewicz M', 'Stella-Holowiecka B', 'Wylezol I']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol Arch Med Wewn,Polskie Archiwum Medycyny Wewnetrznej,0401225,,2007/03/08 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/03/08 09:00'],"['2007/03/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/08 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pol Arch Med Wewn. 2006 Jul;116(1):671-7.,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/*therapy', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,['Klinika Hematologii i Transplantacji Szpiku Slaskiej Akademii Medycznej w Katowicach. klinhem@slam.katowice.pl'],,Wplyw przewleklej choroby przeszczep-przeciw-gospodarzowi na odlegle wyniki allogenicznej transplantacji komorek krwiotworczych u doroslych chorych na ostra bialaczke limfoblastyczna.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is directed by forming tightly bound inhibitory complexes with MMPs. Recent years have revealed important differences of various biological activities between TIMP families but molecular mechanisms are not clear. To define the molecular mechanisms of TIMP-1-dependent biological processes, we used TIMP-1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, along with a human ovary cDNA library. Further characterization revealed the ninth zinc finger domain as an interacting domain of the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). Interaction of PLZF with TIMP-1 in mammalian cells was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and with in vitro binding assays. We investigated whether TIMP-1-mediated anti-apoptotic activity could promote the growth of ovarian cancer in an experimental model system. TIMP-1 treatment was found to be more effective at increasing ovarian cancer growth when compared with PLZF in parallel experiments. Subsequently, the efficacy of a combined treatment with TIMP-1 and PLZF was investigated. In the presence of both of these proteins, TIMP-1 significantly reduced apoptosis induced by PLZF in cervical carcinoma cells. These combined results indicate that TIMP-1 functions as an anti-activator of the transcriptional repressive activity of PLZF.","['Rho, Seung Bae', 'Chung, Bo Mee', 'Lee, Je-Ho']","['Rho SB', 'Chung BM', 'Lee JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/06/07 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2007 May 1;101(1):57-67. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21127.,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 3/analysis', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Library', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ovary/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/*metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', '*Zinc Fingers']",['10.1002/jcb.21127 [doi]'],"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']","['Molecular Therapy Research Center, Sungkyunkwan University, Samsung Medical Center Annex 8F, 50, Ilwon-Dong, Kangnam-Ku, Seoul 135-710, South Korea. sbrho@smc.samsung.co.kr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib has demonstrated synergistic effects in vitro with mitoxantrone, etoposide, and cytarabine. METHODS: A Phase I/II trial was performed in patients with CML myeloid blast crisis. Patients were treated with imatinib + mitoxantrone/etoposide in four cohorts: mitoxantrone 10 mg/m(2)/day and etoposide 100 mg/m(2)/day for 2 or 3 consecutive days and imatinib 600 mg/day from Day 15 (cohorts 1 and 2) or from Day 1 (cohorts 3 and 4). After hematologic reconstitution after the cytopenic phase, cytarabine was given at a dose of 10 mg/m(2)/day in addition to imatinib as maintenance treatment. RESULTS: A total of 16 patients were available for analysis, median age 59 years (range, 37-74). All patients who received more intensive induction treatment (cohorts 3 and 4, n = 7) achieved a hematologic response (HR). In contrast, HR was achieved in only 6 of 9 patients treated in cohorts 1 and 2. The induction treatment was well tolerated. Six patients who achieved HR received an allo-SCT with myeloablative conditioning. The median survival in the transplant group was 16.2 months vs 4.7 months in the group with conventional treatment only (P = .067). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of mitoxantrone/etoposide and imatinib is well tolerated, with mild nonhematologic toxicity even in older patients. Eligible patients benefit from allo-SCT after response to the induction treatment.","['Fruehauf, Stefan', 'Topaly, Julian', 'Buss, Eike C', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Emmerich, Bertold', 'Muller, Martin C', 'Schuld, Peter', 'Balleisen, Leopold', 'Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Ho, Anthony D', 'Hochhaus, Andreas']","['Fruehauf S', 'Topaly J', 'Buss EC', 'Fischer T', 'Ottmann OG', 'Emmerich B', 'Muller MC', 'Schuld P', 'Balleisen L', 'Hehlmann R', 'Ho AD', 'Hochhaus A']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Apr 15;109(8):1543-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22535.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",['10.1002/cncr.22535 [doi]'],,"['Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. prof.stefan.fruehauf@pk-mx.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we questioned whether CBD modulates activation of mast cells, key players in inflammation. By using the rat basophilic leukemia mast cell line (RBL-2H3), we demonstrate that CBD (3-10 muM) augments beta-hexosaminidase release, a marker of cell activation, from antigen-stimulated and unstimulated cells via a mechanism, which is not mediated by G(i)/G(o) protein-coupled receptors but rather is associated with a robust rise in intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) levels sensitive to clotrimazole and nitrendipine (10-30 muM). This action, although mimicked by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is opposite to that inhibitory, exerted by the synthetic cannabinoids WIN 55,212-2 and CP 55,940. Moreover, the vanilloid capsaicin, a full agonist of transient receptor potential channel VR1, did not affect [Ca(2+)](i)levels in the RBL-2H3 cells, thus excluding the involvement of this receptor in the CBD-mediated effects. Together, these results support existence of yet-to-be identified sites of interaction, i.e., receptors and/or ion channels associated with Ca(2+) influx of natural cannabinoids such as CBD and THC, the identification of which has the potential to provide for novel strategies and agents of therapeutic interest.","['Giudice, Elda Del', 'Rinaldi, Luciano', 'Passarotto, Marzia', 'Facchinetti, Fabrizio', ""D'Arrigo, Antonello"", 'Guiotto, Adriano', 'Carbonare, Maurizio Dalle', 'Battistin, Leontino', 'Leon, Alberta']","['Giudice ED', 'Rinaldi L', 'Passarotto M', 'Facchinetti F', ""D'Arrigo A"", 'Guiotto A', 'Carbonare MD', 'Battistin L', 'Leon A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/09/18 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2007 Jun;81(6):1512-22. doi: 10.1189/jlb.1206738.

We have identified a common, nonsynonymous, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the coding region of CD89 (844A-->G) (rs16986050), which changes codon 248 from AGC (Ser(248)) to GGC (Gly(248)) in the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. The two different alleles demonstrate significantly different FcalphaRI-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia cells and cytokine production (IL-6 and TNF-alpha) in murine macrophage P388D1 cells. In the absence of FcR gamma-chain association in P388D1 cells, the Ser(248)-FcalphaRI allele does not mediate cytokine production, but the Gly(248)-FcalphaRI allele retains the capacity to mediate a robust production of proinflammatory cytokine. This allele-dependent difference is also seen with FcalphaRI-mediated IL-6 cytokine release by human neutrophils ex vivo. These findings and the enrichment of the proinflammatory Gly(248)-FcalphaRI allele in systemic lupus erythematosus populations in two ethnic groups compared with their respective non-systemic lupus erythematosus controls suggest that FcalphaRI (CD89) alpha-chain alleles may affect receptor-mediated signaling and play an important role in the modulation of immune responses in inflammatory diseases.","['Wu, Jianming', 'Ji, Chuanyi', 'Xie, Fenglong', 'Langefeld, Carl D', 'Qian, Kun', 'Gibson, Andrew W', 'Edberg, Jeffrey C', 'Kimberly, Robert P']","['Wu J', 'Ji C', 'Xie F', 'Langefeld CD', 'Qian K', 'Gibson AW', 'Edberg JC', 'Kimberly RP']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Mar 15;178(6):3973-82. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3973.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Fc(alpha) receptor)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*genetics/*immunology', 'Cell Degranulation/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endocytosis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/blood/*immunology', 'Interleukin-6/immunology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood/genetics/immunology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Phagocytosis/genetics/immunology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Fc/*genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology']","['178/6/3973 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3973 [doi]']",,"['Division of Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of Alabama at Birmingham, 1825 University Boulevard, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']","['P30 AR 48311/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR 33062/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AR048311/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00032/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR033062/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 AI 40068/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AR 49084/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the immediate symptoms of allergy are mainly IgE-mediated, allergen-specific T cell responses contribute to the late phase as well as to the chronic manifestations of allergy. This study investigates the potential of costimulation blockade with CTLA4Ig and an anti-CD154 mAb for modifying the allergic immune response to the major timothy grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 in a mouse model. BALB/c mice were treated with the costimulation blockers at the time of primary sensitization to the Phl p 5 allergen or at the time of a secondary allergen challenge. Costimulation blockade (CTLA4Ig plus anti-CD154 or anti-CD154 alone) at the time of sensitization prevented the development of allergen-specific IgE, IgM, IgG, and IgA responses compared with untreated but sensitized mice. However, costimulation blockade had no influence on established IgE responses in sensitized mice. Immediate-type reactions as analyzed by a rat basophil leukemia cell mediator release assay were only suppressed by early treatment but not by a costimulation blockade after sensitization. CTLA4Ig given alone failed to suppress both the primary and the secondary allergen-specific Ab responses. Allergen-specific T cell activation was suppressed in mice by early as well as by a late costimulation blockade, suggesting that IgE responses in sensitized mice are independent of T cell help. Our results indicate that T cell suppression alone without active immune regulation or a shifting of the Th2/Th1 balance is not sufficient for the treatment of established IgE responses in an allergy.","['Linhart, Birgit', 'Bigenzahn, Sinda', 'Hartl, Arnulf', 'Lupinek, Christian', 'Thalhamer, Josef', 'Valenta, Rudolf', 'Wekerle, Thomas']","['Linhart B', 'Bigenzahn S', 'Hartl A', 'Lupinek C', 'Thalhamer J', 'Valenta R', 'Wekerle T']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC2993922,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Mar 15;178(6):3924-31. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3924.,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (PHLPII protein, Phleum pratense)', '0 (Phl p V protein, Phleum pratense)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '7D0YB67S97 (Abatacept)']",IM,,"['Abatacept', 'Allergens/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Hypersensitivity/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plant Proteins/*immunology', 'Rats', 'Th1 Cells/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology']","['178/6/3924 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3924 [doi]']",,"['Christian Doppler Laboratory for Allergy Research, Division of Immunopathology, Department of Pathophysiology, Center of Physiology and Pathophysiology, Medical University of Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",['F 2310/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,,,,['UKMS32950'],,,,,['NLM: UKMS32950'],,,

Significantly improved overall survival was observed in patients, which were homozygous for HLA-C-encoded group 1 (C1) ligands compared with those with group 2 (C2) ligands. Favorable outcome in the former patient group was an early effect that was highly significant in patients transplanted with G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood and patients with advanced disease stages. In contrast, presence of C1 ligands in the donor was associated with significantly reduced patient survival. The differential roles of the two HLA-C ligands are explained in the context of a biased NK cell reconstitution, which is generally dominated by the presence of C1- but absence of C2-specific NK cells. The clinical observations are corroborated by in vitro experiments showing that NK cells derived from hemopoietic progenitor cells generally acquire the C1-specific inhibitory KIR2DL2/3 at earlier time points and with higher frequency than the C2-specific KIR2DL1.

Conditioning regimens before transplant act to reduce the burden of leukemic cells and the graft-vs-leukemia (GvL) effect can eliminate residual disease. The GvL effect results largely from the recognition of minor histocompatibility Ags by donor T cells on recipient tissues. These Ags are generally widely expressed and also provoke graft-vs-host (GvH) disease. Manipulation of immunity to promote GvL while curtailing GvH would greatly improve clinical outcome. To develop strategies that may achieve this, the parameters which control immunity to minor histocompatibility Ags need to be defined. In this study, we have analyzed responses to the mouse HY minor histocompatibility Ag using hemopoietic cell and skin grafts as surrogate GvL and GvH targets, respectively. We show that natural regulation of CD8 T cell responses to HY operates at multiple levels. First, CD4 T cell help is required for primary CD8 responses directed at hemopoietic cells. However, although CD4 T cells of H2(k) mouse strains recognize HY, they provide ineffective help associated with a proportion of recipients developing tolerance. This was further investigated using TCR-transgenic mice which revealed H2(k)-restricted HY-specific CD4 T cells are highly susceptible to regulation by CD25(+) regulatory T cells which expand in tolerant recipients. A second level of regulation, operating in the context of skin grafts, involves direct inhibition of CD8 T cell responses by CD94/NKG2 engagement of the nonclassical MHC class I molecule Qa1.","['Robertson, Nathan J', 'Chai, Jian-Guo', 'Millrain, Maggie', 'Scott, Diane', 'Hashim, Fazila', 'Manktelow, Emily', 'Lemonnier, Francois', 'Simpson, Elizabeth', 'Dyson, Julian']","['Robertson NJ', 'Chai JG', 'Millrain M', 'Scott D', 'Hashim F', 'Manktelow E', 'Lemonnier F', 'Simpson E', 'Dyson J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Mar 15;178(6):3558-65. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3558.,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRC1 protein, human)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Q surface antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Natural Killer Cell)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/therapy', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily C', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/immunology', 'Receptors, Natural Killer Cell', 'Skin Transplantation/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']","['178/6/3558 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3558 [doi]']",,"['Transplantation Biology Group, Department of Immunology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This mechanism explains how, at equivalent levels of receptor occupancy, a rapidly dissociating ligand can be less effective than a more slowly dissociating analog at generating distal cellular responses. Simple mathematical models predict that kinetic proofreading is limited to the initial complex; once the signal passes to second messengers, the dwell time no longer regulates the signal. This suggests that an assay for kinetic proofreading might be used to determine which activation events occur within the initial signaling complex. In signaling through the high affinity IgE receptor FcepsilonRI, the transmembrane adaptor called linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is thought to nucleate a distinct secondary complex. Experiments in which the concentrations of two ligands with different dwell times are adjusted to equalize the level of LAT phosphorylation in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cells show that Erk2 phosphorylation, intracellular Ca(2+), and degranulation exhibit kinetic proofreading downstream of LAT phosphorylation. These results suggest that ligand-bound FcepsilonRI and LAT form a complex that is required for effective signal transmission.","['Torigoe, Chikako', 'Faeder, James R', 'Oliver, Janet M', 'Goldstein, Byron']","['Torigoe C', 'Faeder JR', 'Oliver JM', 'Goldstein B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,PMC2593628,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/05/23 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/23 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2007 Mar 15;178(6):3530-5. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3530.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Lat protein, rat)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Calcium Signaling/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', '*Models, Biological', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism']","['178/6/3530 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.178.6.3530 [doi]']",,"['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']","['R37 GM 35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 GM065794/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM 065794/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM035556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM 49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 EB005365-03/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM049814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['NIHMS60574'],,,,,,,,

Several compounds have been identified that antagonize the effects of cytokinins. Based on structural similarities and competitive inhibition, it has been assumed that these anticytokinins act through a common cellular target, namely the cytokinin receptor. Here, we examined directly the possibility that various representative classical anticytokinins inhibit the Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors CRE1/AHK4 (cytokinin response 1/Arabidopsis histidine kinase 4) and AHK3 (Arabidopsis histidine kinase 3). We show that pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine and pyrazolo[4,3-d]pyrimidine anticytokinins do not act as competitors of cytokinins at the receptor level. Flow cytometry and microscopic analyses revealed that anticytokinins inhibit the cell cycle and cause disorganization of the microtubular cytoskeleton and apoptosis. This is consistent with the hypothesis that they inhibit regulatory cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) enzymes. Biochemical studies demonstrated inhibition by selected anti-cytokinins of both Arabidopsis and human CDKs. X-ray determination of the crystal structure of a human CDK2-anticytokinin complex demonstrated that the antagonist occupies the ATP-binding site of CDK2. Finally, treatment of human cancer cell lines with anticytokinins demonstrated their ability to kill human cells with similar effectiveness as known CDK inhibitors.","['Spichal, Lukas', 'Krystof, Vladimir', 'Paprskarova, Martina', 'Lenobel, Rene', 'Styskala, Jakub', 'Binarova, Pavla', 'Cenklova, Vera', 'De Veylder, Lieven', 'Inze, Dirk', 'Kontopidis, George', 'Fischer, Peter M', 'Schmulling, Thomas', 'Strnad, Miroslav']","['Spichal L', 'Krystof V', 'Paprskarova M', 'Lenobel R', 'Styskala J', 'Binarova P', 'Cenklova V', 'De Veylder L', 'Inze D', 'Kontopidis G', 'Fischer PM', 'Schmulling T', 'Strnad M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/06/29 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/29 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2007 May 11;282(19):14356-63. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M609750200.

Recent studies have reported the feasibility of autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) in this population. We evaluate the outcome of this post-remission approach after complete remission (CR) and consolidation in elderly patients included in the EORTC-GIMEMA AML-13 trial. DESIGN AND METHODS: PBSCT after induction and consolidation chemotherapy was evaluated in patients aged 61 to 70 years with a WHO performance status 0-1. The induction therapy was mitoxantrone, etoposide and cytarabine (MICE) with or without granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) during and/or after chemotherapy. The consolidation therapy consisted of non-infusion or infusional idarubicin, etposide and cytarabine (mini-ICE). RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were scheduled for stem cell harvest by leukapheresis after s.c. recombinant human G-CSF administration initiated after hematopoietic recovery from consolidation. Stem cells were effectively harvested from 54 patients. A median of two aphereses (range, 1-5) were performed, resulting in a median collection of 11.7 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg (range, 2.4-99.8) containing 40.2 x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg (range, 0-786.8), and 5 x 10(6) CD34+ cells/kg (range, 0.1-99.8). For the whole group of 61 patients, the median disease-free survival (DFS) was 1.0 years and the 3-year DFS rate was 21%, while the median overall survival (OS) was 1.4 years and the 3-year OS rate was 32%. A total of 26 patients could not be autografed due to inadequate/no harvest (21 patients), early relapse (3 patients), or treatment refusal (2 patients). Autologous transplantation was performed in 35 patients following conditioning with the BAVC regimen. The median time for granulocyte recovery >0.5 109 yen/L was 24 days and for platelets >20 x10(9)/L was 23 days following transplantation. After a median follow-up of 5.0 years from transplantation, the median DFS and OS were 1.1 and 1.6 years respectively, and the 3-year rates were 28% and 39% respectively. Eight autografted patients were still in continuous complete remission, 22 patients had relapsed and five had died in CR. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Intensification of remission including autologous PBSCT is feasible in about half of harvested patients aged 61 to 70 years old, and did not improve the general outcome. This shows the limitations of autologous PBSCT and other intensive treatment modalities in elderly AML patients.

The main characteristics of ChTCR are their ability to redirect T-cell specificity and their killing/effector activity toward a selected target in a non MHC-restricted manner, exploiting the antigen binding properties of monoclonal antibodies. ChTCR are, in fact, artificial T-cell receptors constituted by an antigen-recognizing antibody molecule linked to a T-cell triggering domain. Various hematologic malignancies represent optimal targets for the exploitation of ChTCR, because of the bright expression of specific antigens on the surface of tumor cells. Thus, CD19 and CD20 have been targeted for B-cell lymphoid tumors (acute lymphoblastic leukemia-ALL, lymphomas and chronic lymphocytic leukemia-CLL), CD33 for myeloid leukemia, and CD30 for lymphomas. Even though technical and safety progresses are still needed to improve the profile of gene transfer and protein expression of ChTCR, phase 1 trials will be carried out in the near future to demonstrate the feasibility of their clinical translation and, it is be hoped, give preliminary indications about their anti-tumor efficacy.","['Biagi, Ettore', 'Marin, Virna', 'Giordano Attianese, Greta Maria Paola', 'Dander, Erica', ""D'Amico, Giovanna"", 'Biondi, Andrea']","['Biagi E', 'Marin V', 'Giordano Attianese GM', 'Dander E', ""D'Amico G"", 'Biondi A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):381-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10873.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Forecasting', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Ki-1 Antigen/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",['10.3324/haematol.10873 [doi]'],,"['Centro di Ricerca Matilde Tettamanti, Department of Pediatrics, University of Milano-Bicocca, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Milan, Italy. ettore.biagi@pediatriamonza.it']",,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was aimed to examine a possible relationship between CXCR3 expression in CLL and the clinical evolution of the disease. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using flow activated cell sorting (FACS), we analyzed the level of expression of CXCR3 on blood CLL B cells from 76 consecutive patients. The results were correlated with CD38 expression, IgVH gene status and clinical outcome. RESULTS: CXCR3, measured as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), was unimodally expressed by blood tumor cells at various levels (range, 3.5 to 232.3) but levels within individual patients were remarkably stable over time. Low CXCR3 expression by CLL B cells was strongly associated with Rai disease stages III and IV (p<0.0001) and a pattern of diffuse tumor infiltration of the bone marrow (p<0.0001). In the 28 cases available for genetic studies, low CXCR3 expression also showed good concordance with tumor unmutated IgVH gene status (p<0.04), and tended to correlate with high CD38 expression (p<0.06). Patients with low CXCR3 expression (MFI < or =15) had a shorter survival (p<0.0001) and, in multivariate analysis, low CXCR3 expression (MFI pound15) was an independent predictor of poor outcome (hazard ratio 24.5; p<0.01). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONSL: CXCR3 expression by CLL B cells appears to be stable within individual patients.

Results of the GIMEMA ALL 0496 trial.,342-8,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The prognostic value of myeloid antigen (MyAg) expression in adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is still controversial. The aim of this study was to correlate the expression of MyAg with clinical, hematologic and biological parameters, and to analyze the impact on response to treatment and prognosis in a large series of adult ALL uniformly characterized and treated. DESIGN AND METHODS: We analyzed the expression of the MyAg CD13 and/or CD33 in a cohort of 377 adult patients with de novo ALL enrolled and treated in the GIMEMA ALL 0496 protocol. RESULTS: MyAg expression was documented in 35% of the 377 adult ALL cases analyzed. MyAg were significantly more frequently associated with B-lineage ALL (38%) than with T-ALL (24%) (p=0.02). No difference was found with regard to clinical features at presentation; a difference was found only for white cell count (p=0.03), percentage of peripheral blasts (p=0.004) and platelet count (p=0.004). No difference was observed in the expression of MyAg between patients with normal or abnormal cytogenetics or between those with high-risk (BCR-ABL+, ALL1-AF4+, E2A-PBX1+) or low-risk B-lineage ALL. We failed to observe any difference between MyAg-positive and MyAg-negative cases in terms of achievement of complete remission, disease-free survival and overall survival at 5 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that ALL MyAg expression in adults with ALL is not associated with adverse presenting clinical and biological features, and that response to treatment and prognosis is comparable in MyAg-positive and MyAg-negative ALL patients with regards to both complete remission rate and overall survival. We suppose that these result are due to more intensive treatment modalities adopted in the GIMEMA ALL 0496 protocol.","['Vitale, Antonella', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Ariola, Cristina', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Perbellini, Omar', 'Pizzuti, Michele', 'De Gregoris, Cinzia', 'Mettivier, Vincenzo', 'Pastorini, Alessandro', 'Pizzolo, Giovanni', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Foa, Robin']","['Vitale A', 'Guarini A', 'Ariola C', 'Meloni G', 'Perbellini O', 'Pizzuti M', 'De Gregoris C', 'Mettivier V', 'Pastorini A', 'Pizzolo G', 'Vignetti M', 'Mandelli F', 'Foa R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):342-8. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10385.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/radiotherapy', 'CD13 Antigens/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/*metabolism/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Remission Induction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",['10.3324/haematol.10385 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Via Benevento 6, Rome, 00161 Italy. vitale@bce.uniroma1.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the effects of various chemokines on proliferation of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and constitutive chemokine release by primary AML cells. DESIGN AND METHODS: Native human AML cells derived from 68 consecutive patients were cultured in vitro. We investigated AML cell proliferation (3H-thymidine incorporation, colony formation), chemokine receptor expression, constitutive chemokine release and chemotaxis of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. RESULTS: Exogenous chemokines usually did not have any effect on AML blast proliferation in the absence of hematopoietic growth factors, but when investigating growth factor-dependent (interleukin 3 + granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor + stem cell factor) proliferation in suspension cultures the following patient subsets were identified: (i) patients whose cells showed chemokine-induced growth enhancement (8 patients); (ii) divergent effects on proliferation (15 patients); and (iii) no effect (most patients). These patient subsets did not differ in chemokine receptor expression, but, compared to CD34- AML cells, CD34+ cells showed higher expression of several receptors. Chemokines also increased the proliferation of clonogenic AML cells from the first subset of patients. Furthermore, a broad constitutive chemokine release profile was detected for most patients, and the following chemokine clusters could be identified: CCL2-4/CXCL1/8, CCL5/CXCL9-11 (possibly also CCL23) and CCL13/17/22/24/CXCL5 (possibly also CXCL6). Only the CCL2-4/CXCL1/8 cluster showed significant correlations between corresponding mRNA levels and NFkB levels/activation. The chemotaxis of normal immunocompetent cells for patients without constitutive chemokine release was observed to be decreased. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Differences in chemokine responsiveness as well as chemokine release contribute to patient heterogeneity in AML. Patients with AML can be classified into distinct subsets according to their chemokine responsiveness and chemokine release profile.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Ryningen, Anita', 'Olsnes, Astrid Marta', 'Stordrange, Laila', 'Oyan, Anne Margrete', 'Kalland, Karl Henning', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Bruserud O', 'Ryningen A', 'Olsnes AM', 'Stordrange L', 'Oyan AM', 'Kalland KH', 'Gjertsen BT']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):332-41. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10148.,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/metabolism', 'Chemokines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Chemokine/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",['10.3324/haematol.10148 [doi]'],,"['Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital and The University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a stem cell disease. The inefficient targeting of the leukemic stem cells (LSC) is considered responsible for relapse after the induction of complete hematologic remission (CR) in AML. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML characterized by the t(15;17) translocation and expression of the PML/RARalpha fusion protein. Treatment of APL with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) induces CR, but not molecular remission (CMR), because the fusion transcript remains detectable, followed by relapse within a few months. Arsenic induces high rates of CR and CMR followed by a long relapse-free survival (RFS). Here we compared the effects of ATRA and arsenic on PML/RARalpha-positive stem cell compartments. DESIGN AND METHODS: As models for the PML/RARalpha-positive LSC we used: (i) Sca1+/lin- murine HSC retrovirally transduced with PML/RARalpha; (ii) LSC from mice with PML/RARalpha-positive leukemia; (iii) the side population of the APL cell line NB4. RESULTS: In contrast to ATRA, arsenic abolishes the aberrant stem cell capacity of PML/RARalpha-positive stem cells. Arsenic had no apparent influence on the proliferation of PML/RARalpha-positive stem cells, whereas ATRA greatly increased the proliferation of these cells. Furthermore ATRA induces proliferation of APL-derived stem cells, whereas arsenic inhibits their growth. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Taken together our data suggest a relationship between the capacity of a compound to target the leukemia-initiating cell and its ability to induce long relapse-free survival. These data strongly support the importance of efficient LSC-targeting for the outcome of patients with leukemia.","['Zheng, Xiaomin', 'Seshire, Anita', 'Ruster, Brigitte', 'Bug, Gesine', 'Beissert, Tim', 'Puccetti, Elena', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Henschler, Reinhard', 'Ruthardt, Martin']","['Zheng X', 'Seshire A', 'Ruster B', 'Bug G', 'Beissert T', 'Puccetti E', 'Hoelzer D', 'Henschler R', 'Ruthardt M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):323-31. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10541.,"['0 (ATXN1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Ataxin-1)', '0 (Ataxins)', '0 (Atxn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Ataxin-1', 'Ataxins', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/analysis', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/physiology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",['10.3324/haematol.10541 [doi]'],,"['Laboratory of Tumor Stem Cell Biology, Department of Hematology, J.W.

However, its clinical value remains to be determined. Our aim was to analyze any associations between the risk of relapse and RQ-PCR results in different phases of treatment, comparing these data with those yielded by conventional qualitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. DESIGN AND METHODS: Follow-up samples from 145 APL patients treated with the PETHEMA protocols were evaluated by the RQ-PCR protocol (Europe Against Cancer program) and by the RT-PCR method (BIOMED-1 Concerted Action). Hematologic and molecular relapses and relapse-free survival were recorded. We then looked for associations between relapse risk and RQ-PCR results. RESULTS: After induction therapy, no association was found between positive RQ-PCR results and relapse. The PCR result here did not imply any change in the scheduled therapy. After the third consolidation course, two out of three cases with positive RQ-PCR relapsed in contrast to 16 out of 119 (13%) patients with negative RQ-PCR. During maintenance therapy and out-of treatment, all patients with >10 PML-RARalpha normalized copy number (NCN) (n=19) relapsed while all patients with <1 NCN at the end of the study remained in hematologic remission (p<0.0001). In the intermediate group (NCN 1-10) (n=18), the relapse-free survival at 5 years was 60%. Hematologic relapses were predicted if a positive RQ-PCR result had been obtained in a follow-up sample within the previous 4 months. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Based on the information provided by RQ-PCR in samples obtained after the end of consolidation and subsequently, a relapse risk stratification could be established for APL patients. This stratification divides patients into three groups: those at high risk of relapse, those with an intermediate risk and those with a low risk of relapse.","['Santamaria, Carlos', 'Chillon, Maria Carmen', 'Fernandez, Carina', 'Martin-Jimenez, Patricia', 'Balanzategui, Ana', 'Garcia Sanz, Ramon', 'San Miguel, Jesus F', 'Gonzalez, Marcos-Gonzalez']","['Santamaria C', 'Chillon MC', 'Fernandez C', 'Martin-Jimenez P', 'Balanzategui A', 'Garcia Sanz R', 'San Miguel JF', 'Gonzalez MG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/26 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/26 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):315-22. doi: 10.3324/haematol.10734.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'AIDA protocol']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/genetics', 'Child', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Computer Systems', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic/statistics & numerical data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*blood/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",['10.3324/haematol.10734 [doi]'],,"['Departament of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",,,,,['Haematologica. 2007 Mar;92(3):289-91.

DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study analyzing the prevalence of the polymorphisms CYP1A1*2A, CYP2E1*5B, CYP3A4*1B, del{GSTT1}, del{GSTM1}, NQO1*2, MTHFR C6777, and TYMS 2R/3R in 443 patients with AL [302 with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and 141 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)] and 454 control volunteers, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. RESULTS: We found a higher incidence of del{GSTT1} in patients with AML than among controls (25.6% vs. 13.7%, OR=2.2, p<0.001) and a higher incidence of NQO1*2 homozygosity (NQO1*2hom.) in males with the M3 FAB subtype than in control males (8.6% vs. 2.2%, OR=4.9, p=0.02). The del{GSTT1} and NQO1*2hom. polymorphisms increased the risk of ALL (OR=2.2 and 3.0, p=0.001 and 0.003, respectively). The higher risk conferred by NQO1*2hom. and del{GSTT1} mainly affected males (OR=6.1 and 2.4; p=0.002 and 0.005, respectively). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Males harboring NQO1*2hom. and del{GSTT1} polymorphisms showed a higher risk than females of developing AL.

By revealing subtle alterations in both the conformation and concentration of key macromolecules, such as DNA, protein and lipids, IR spectroscopy has been employed to investigate multiple aspects of leucocyte physiology. IR spectroscopy has been used, for example, to diagnose and prognose leukaemia; to characterise differentiation and apoptotic processes; to predict drug sensitivity and resistance in leukaemic patients undergoing chemotherapy; to monitor the response of leucocytes to chemotherapy and to perform human leucocyte antigen matching for bone marrow transplant patients. Such studies have provided insight into pathogenic mechanisms underlying specific leucocyte disorders, especially leukaemia. While it is likely to be some considerable time before IR spectroscopy is sufficiently developed to displace the established technologies, IR spectroscopy has the potential to become a valuable analytic tool in basic and clinical haematology.","['Liu, Kan-Zhi', 'Xu, Minqi', 'Scott, David A']","['Liu KZ', 'Xu M', 'Scott DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,2007/03/07 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/03/07 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/07 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2007 Mar;136(5):713-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06474.x.,,IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Spectrophotometry, Infrared']","['BJH6474 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2006.06474.x [doi]']",,"['Institute for Biodiagnostics, National Research Council of Canada, Winnipeg, MB, Canada. kan-zhi.liu@nrc-cnrc.gc.ca']",,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,

Combinations of anthracyclines and cytarabine remain the cornerstone of therapy and produce complete remission in 45-55% of older patients, with a median survival of only 8-12 months. These statistics become even worse in patients over 70 years and those with unfavorable cytogenetics and/or poor performance status. Deciding which older acute myeloid leukemia patients would benefit from intensive chemotherapy is difficult and efforts are underway to improve existing risk-assessment tools. Many new agents are under development, including signal transduction inhibitors, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, antibodies and novel chemotherapeutics. To date, small-molecule inhibitors and targeted therapies have had limited single-agent efficacy and have required combination with chemotherapy. The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in older patients is under investigation.

Infectious agents causing NHL can be classified, according to mechanism, into three broad groups. First, some viruses can directly transform lymphocytes. Lymphocyte-transforming viruses include Epstein Barr virus (linked to Burkitt's lymphoma, NHLs in immunosuppressed individuals, and extranodal natural killer/T-cell NHL), human herpesvirus 8 (primary effusion lymphoma), and human T lymphotropic virus type I (adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma). Second, human immunodeficiency virus is unique in causing profound depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes, leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an associated high risk for some NHL subtypes. Third, recent evidence suggests that some infections increase NHL risk through chronic immune stimulation. These infections include hepatitis C virus as well as certain bacteria that cause chronic site-specific inflammation and seem to increase risk for localized mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue NHLs. Establishing that an infectious agent causes NHL depends on showing that the agent is present in persons with NHL as well as laboratory experiments elucidating the mechanisms involved. Only epidemiologic studies can provide evidence that infection is actually a risk factor by showing that infection is more frequent in NHL cases than in controls. Given the range of mechanisms by which infections could plausibly cause NHL and our growing molecular understanding of this malignancy, this field of research deserves continued attention.","['Engels, Eric A']",['Engels EA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2007 Mar;16(3):401-4. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-06-1056.

To clarify this issue, we undertook a systematic review of all case-control and cohort studies that identified probable occupational exposures to benzene and NHL morbidity or mortality. We identified 43 case-control studies of NHL outcomes that recognized persons with probable occupational exposure to benzene. Forty of these 43 (93%) studies show some elevation of NHL risk, with 23 of 43 (53%) studies finding statistically significant associations between NHL risk and probable benzene exposure. We also identified 26 studies of petroleum refinery workers reporting morbidity or mortality for lymphomas and all neoplasms and found that in 23 (88%), the rate of lymphoma morbidity or mortality was higher than that for all neoplasms. A substantial healthy-worker effect was evident in many of the studies and a comprehensive reevaluation of these studies with appropriate adjustments should be undertaken. Numerous studies have also reported associations between benzene exposure and the induction of lymphomas in mice. Further, because benzene is similar to alkylating drugs and radiation in producing leukemia, it is plausible that it might also produce lymphoma as they do and by similar mechanisms.

Persistent lymphocytosis of small, mature, or reactive lymphocytes is most commonly the result of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or lymphoma. The first step in distinguishing nonneoplastic from neoplastic lymphocytosis is immunophenotyping by flow cytometry to determine the phenotypic diversity of the circulating cells. Clonality testing using the polymerase chain reaction for antigen receptor rearrangements assay is a useful second step in cases in which the phenotype data are equivocal.

These regimens rely largely on graft-versus-leukemia effects rather than high-dose therapy to eliminate malignant cells. Studies indicate that there is sustained engraftment with relatively low transplant-related mortality in the small number of patients who have been treated. This review summarizes the outcome in recent studies of patients with myeloid malignancies who received HCT following nonmyeloablative or reduced-intensity conditioning. Comparison of nonmyeloablative with myeloablative transplant shows that the myeloablative patients are about 10-15 years younger. Toxicity is a major problem in the elderly who have comorbid conditions, but otherwise the patient has a similar outcome, again emphasizing the graft-versus-leukemia effect. Comparison of patients receiving related or unrelated grafts following nonmyeloablative conditioning shows that the outcome in these patients is similar. These studies have demonstrated encouraging overall survival and nonrelapse mortalities with evidence for graft-versus-leukemia responses in elderly patients with hematologic malignancies. Relapse and progressive disease continued to be problems, particularly in patients with large tumor burdens at time of HCT. Elimination of tumor burden prior to transplant with immunotherapy such as with radiolabeled anti-CD45 antibody or vaccines may improve outcome further.","['Storb, Rainer']",['Storb R'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Strategies have included intensive preparative regimens using busulfan and etoposide, and evolving strategies for pre-transplant consolidation and stem cell collection. Treatment-related mortality has been low (<5%), and after problems with slow engraftment and extended mucosal and skin toxicity in initial studies using 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC)-purged bone marrow, peripheral blood autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been well tolerated even in older patients. In particular, careful attention to avoiding neurotoxicity associated with the use of high-dose cytarabine has limited dropout rates. Long-term event-free survival (EFS) has been excellent in first remission (CR1) cytogenetically favorable groups, particularly with post-transplant treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; EFS 88%). ASCT in advanced disease showed overall long-term EFS of 44%; patients with APL in second remission achieved long-term EFS of 64%. Even among those failing primary induction, after remission induction with an alternative regimen, EFS was 61%. ASCT appears to be a treatment of choice for those in APL CR2, and offers some curative potential for AML CR2. The role of ASCT for those in CR1 is less clear, in part because high dropout rates in large randomized studies complicates interpretation of those studies. New directions for ASCT in the treatment of AML should focus on improving therapy, including calibrated intensification of induction regimens using plasma-kinetics targeting of dosages and the development and incorporation of immunotherapies into consolidation regimens.","['Linker, Charles']",['Linker C'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Autologous transplant appears to have a more favorable outcome than allogeneic transplant in this setting, particularly when carried out during second remission, primarily because of significantly higher treatment-related mortality with allogeneic transplants. Allogeneic transplant, however, should be strongly considered for patients who remain molecularly positive. Future directions for APL therapy should include developing agents that can prevent relapse, particularly for high-risk patients. Other future treatment strategies may include use of ATO administered concomitantly or sequentially with chemotherapy, gemtuzumab or FLT-3 inhibitors that may obviate the need for autologous transplantation, and posttransplant maintenance perhaps with FLT-3 inhibitors.","['Tallman, Martin S']",['Tallman MS'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Targeted therapy has become a buzzword, with its meaning lost from overuse. In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), gastrointestinal stromal cell tumor, and a small subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, a validated target has been identified and a highly specific therapeutic agent has been developed. Targeted therapy generally requires a pathophysiological Achilles heel in a tumor that can be exploited by nontoxic therapy. In most cases, the validated target has been a tyrosine kinase enzyme critical for tumor growth and survival. Are similar ""drugable"" targets available in AML? While our understanding of the pathophysiology of AML has advanced over the past decade, and some potential targets have been identified, no single agent will likely produce a significant proportion of remissions. On the other hand, nascent attempts with mild success have been achieved, yielding hope that this strategy will bear real fruit in the future.","['Stone, Richard M']",['Stone RM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Secondary leukemia can also be a consequence of treatment with chemotherapy, including alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors, and/or radiotherapy, or due to exposure to environmental carcinogens. Outcomes for this large and variable group of patients with secondary AML have been poor compared to people who develop AML de novo. The question arises whether a diagnosis of secondary leukemia per se indicates a poor prognosis or whether their bad outcomes result from an association with certain morphologic and biologic characteristics. Morphologic dysplasia in de novo AML is related to unfavorable cytogenetics, but has no independent prognostic relevance under the conditions of intensive chemotherapy. While there is no significant correlation between cytogenetic risk groups and dysplasia, cytogenetic features do have an impact on outcome among both de novo and secondary AML patients. In various subgroups of secondary AML, the spectrum of cytogenetic abnormalities is similar to de novo AML, but the frequency of abnormalities associated with unfavorable and intermediate risk cytogenetics, such as a complex karyotype, trisomy 8, monosomy 7, and others, is higher in secondary AML. The survival of patients with therapy-related myeloid leukemia (t-AML) is generally shorter than for those with de novo AML within the same cytogenetic risk group. Across the population of t-AML, however, survival varies according to cytogenetic risk group, with longer survival in patients with favorable-risk karyotypes. The term secondary AML is too broad and imprecise to be of importance and should not be used. These AML patients should be enrolled on front-line chemotherapy trials and should be stratified by pretreatment disease status and exposure history, if necessary. Most importantly, the molecular and genetic differences that appear to determine the phenotype and the outcome of these patients need to be investigated further.","['Larson, Richard A']",['Larson RA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Other sites for hematopoiesis exist in the body, but these specific microenvironments can be localized and each component can be carefully evaluated using mouse models.

The properties of leukemic stem cells indicate that current chemotherapy drugs will not be effective. The use of current cytotoxic agents is not effective in leukemia because the agents target both the leukemic and normal stem cell populations. Consequently, new strategies are required that specifically and preferentially target the malignant stem cell population, while sparing normal stem cells. Several well known agents are lethal for the leukemic stem cell in preclinical testing. They include parthenolide, commonly known as feverfew, and TDZD-8. They have undergone various levels of preclinical development, but have not been used in patients as yet in the cancer setting.

Subsequent work suggested that all arose from the hematopoietic stem cell. About 20 years ago the oncogene responsible for CML, bcr-abl, was identified, and more recently the mutant genes that cause hypereosinophilic syndrome and systemic mast cell disorder have been discovered. However, until very recently, the origin of PV, ET, and IMF have defied molecular explanation. In 2005, four separate groups working on tyrosine kinase signal transduction reported a gain-of-function, valine-to-phenyalanine, mutation at position 617 in the JH2 domain of the Janus kinase (JAK) 2 cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase. This mutation requires the presence of the erythropoietin, thrombopoietin, or granulocyte-colony stimulating factor receptor/s for function, the mutation leads to functional hyperactivity and appears responsible for hematopoietic growth factor hypersensitivity, the most characteristic finding in these disorders. Virtually all patients with PV and substantial proportions of those with ET and IMF have now been shown to harbor this mutation. The mutant kinase appears to be a useful diagnostic test for myeloproliferative disorders and may have prognostic value. Future research will undoubtedly focus on the development of specific inhibitors as therapeutic agents as well as answering a number of questions that remain regarding the role of signal intensity, genotypic and phenotypic expression and the possible involvement of additional as yet unidentified mutations in these disorders.","['Kaushansky, Kenneth']",['Kaushansky K'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

This risk is not uniform among all cancer patients but is dependent primarily on the depth and duration of neutropenia and the type of underlying disease. Accordingly, the decision whether to use antibacterial prophylaxis to prevent serious infections in these patients requires a balance between expected benefit and the risks for infection, adverse drug-related events, and emergence of antibiotic resistance. Although antibacterial prophylaxis has the potential to benefit all patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, the benefit regarding reduction in documented infections has been firmly established only in patients with neutropenia expected to exceed 7 days. A recent meta-analysis showed enhanced survival in patients receiving antibacterial prophylaxis during neutropenia; most patients enrolled in the analyzed trials had a hematologic malignancy. Among patients with neutropenia at lower risk for infectious complications (a category that includes most patients with solid tumor malignancies), the main benefit of antibacterial prophylaxis relates to a reduction in fever rather than documented infections. The authors advise quinolone prophylaxis (levofloxacin is preferred), in patients with an expected duration of neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/microL) of more than 7 days. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be used in patients at risk for Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P carinii), such as childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In patients with neutropenia expected to last 7 days or less and not receiving immunosuppressive regimens (e.g., systemic corticosteroids), the authors recommend no initial prophylaxis. However, if such patients develop fever during neutropenia, they should be considered for outpatient empiric therapy with an oral quinolone-containing regimen if they meet criteria for low risk for complications.","['Segal, Brahm H', 'Freifeld, Alison G']","['Segal BH', 'Freifeld AG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2006/09/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007 Feb;5(2):235-42. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2007.0023.,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Premedication']",['10.6004/jnccn.2007.0023 [doi]'],,"['Division of Infectious Diseases, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA. brahm.segal@roswellpark.org']",,,,56,,,,,,,,,,,,

Growth factors have been given before, concurrently, or sequentially with chemotherapy with the goal of reducing the duration of neutropenia and consequently the incidence and severity of infections, and improving the rate of remissions and overall survival. They also have been studied as chemotherapy-sensitizing agents in an effort to recruit dormant myeloid stem cells into the sensitive phase of the cycle. Additionally, growth factors, shown to stimulate proliferation and differentiation of leukemia cells in vitro, were evaluated as monotherapy in patients with acute leukemia. Most studies show modest improvement in the duration of the neutropenia, which does not consistently correlate with the severity of infection, rate or duration of remissions, or disease-free and overall survival. Attempts to enhance the chemosensitivity of the leukemic cells and decrease drug resistance failed to improve the rate of remission and survival in several large series. However, more recent reports suggested an improved outcome in younger patients with acute myeloid leukemia with normal karyotype. Several anecdotal case reports have shown that growth factor monotherapy can induce a complete remission in patients with acute leukemia. Data from the published clinical trials do not seem to support emergence of drug-resistant leukemia, worsening toxicity, and bone marrow failure with growth factor administration.","['Frankfurt, Olga', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Frankfurt O', 'Tallman MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Natl Compr Canc Netw,Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network : JNCCN,101162515,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/04/20 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2006/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007 Feb;5(2):203-15. doi: 10.6004/jnccn.2007.0020.,"['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/economics', 'Neutropenia/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/economics', 'Remission Induction']",['10.6004/jnccn.2007.0020 [doi]'],,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Robert H.

SS induces apoptosis and exerts pronounced antiproliferative effects on various human tumors cell lines, human xenografts, and animal tumors including P388 lymphocytic leukemia. In patients with thymoma the combination of octreotide (OCT) with corticosteroids improves the overall response rate. It has been reported that SS can increase glucocorticoid activity. Hereby, we studied the in vitro and in vivo activity of the SS analogue OCT and of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DEX) alone or in combination against the murine P388 lymphocytic leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cultures of P388 lymphocytic leukemia and BDF(1) male mice implanted with P388 cells where used for the in vitro an in vivo evaluation of the antileukemic activity of SS and DEX. RESULTS: OCT induced a moderate and DEX a satisfactory cytostatic effect in vitro. OCT produced borderline antileukemic effect when administered on days 1-5 while DEX was effective in all schemes and routes of administration. However, none of the combination schemes exerted any anti-leukemic activity both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Since both SS and glucocorticoids exert direct (via receptors) and indirect antitumor actions (regulation of growth factor activity) on several cell lines, in vitro and in vivo, it becomes obvious that further in vitro studies shall provide the molecular evidence for the signal transduction pathways which are involved in the interactions of such important anticancer drugs. Based on the results of the present study, the simultaneous use of these drugs in clinical practice should be carefully considered.","['Trafalis, D T P', 'Chrysogelou, E', 'Dalezis, P', 'Geromichalos, G', 'Kontos, M', 'Andreadis, C', 'Ziras, N', 'Koutsilieris, M', 'Athanassiou, A E', 'Pangalis, G A', 'Papageorgiou, A']","['Trafalis DT', 'Chrysogelou E', 'Dalezis P', 'Geromichalos G', 'Kontos M', 'Andreadis C', 'Ziras N', 'Koutsilieris M', 'Athanassiou AE', 'Pangalis GA', 'Papageorgiou A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/03/06 09:01,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/06 09:01 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J BUON. 2005 Jan-Mar;10(1):89-94.,,,,,,,"['1st Department of Medical Oncology, ""Metaxa"" Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ubiquitously expressed RFC has unequivocally established itself as the major transport system in mammalian cells and tissues for a group of compounds including folate cofactors and classical antifolate therapeutics. Loss of RFC expression or function may have potentially profound pathophysiologic consequences including cancer. For chemotherapeutic antifolates used for cancer such as methotrexate or pemetrexed, synthesis of mutant RFCs or loss of RFC transcripts and proteins results in antifolate resistance due to incomplete inhibition of cellular enzyme targets and insufficient substrate for polyglutamate synthesis. Since RFC was first cloned in 1994, tremendous advances have been made in understanding the complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of RFC, in identifying structurally and functionally important domains and amino acids in the RFC molecule as a prelude to establishing the mechanism of transport, and in characterizing the molecular defects in RFC associated with loss of transport in antifolate resistant cell line models. Many of the insights gained from laboratory models of RFC portend opportunities for modulating carrier expression in drug resistant tumors, and for designing a new generation of agents with improved transport by RFC or substantially enhanced transport by other folate transporters over RFC. Many of the advances in the basic biology of RFC in cell line models are now being directly applied to human cancers in the clinical setting, most notably pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and osteogenic sarcoma.","['Matherly, Larry H', 'Hou, Zhanjun', 'Deng, Yijun']","['Matherly LH', 'Hou Z', 'Deng Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007 Mar;26(1):111-28. doi: 10.1007/s10555-007-9046-2.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (SLC19A1 protein, human)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*etiology/metabolism', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein']",['10.1007/s10555-007-9046-2 [doi]'],,"['Developmental Therapeutics Program, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, The Cancer Biology Graduate Program, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. matherly@karmanos.org']","['CA53535/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76641/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,165,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2D [(1)H,(15)N] heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR spectra of (15)N-labeled 1 revealed that the cationic core of this water-soluble complex hardly hydrolyzes in aqueous solution and reacts very slowly with glutathione. Hydrolysis appears not to be an essential step for the formation of Pt-guanosine-5'-monophosphate (5'-GMP) or Pt-DNA adducts because the complex can react readily with 5'-GMP and partially transform B-DNA into its Z form. Such properties are desired to achieve the goal of enhancing cytotoxicity and lowering side effects of Pt(II) complexes. In fact, complex 1 is highly cytotoxic against the murine leukemia (P-388) and the human non-small-cell lung cancer (A-549) cell lines, and it is more cytotoxic than cisplatin at most concentrations tested.","['Fan, Damin', 'Yang, Xiaoliang', 'Wang, Xiaoyong', 'Zhang, Shouchun', 'Mao, Jiafei', 'Ding, Jian', 'Lin, Liping', 'Guo, Zijian']","['Fan D', 'Yang X', 'Wang X', 'Zhang S', 'Mao J', 'Ding J', 'Lin L', 'Guo Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Biol Inorg Chem,Journal of biological inorganic chemistry : JBIC : a publication of the Society of Biological Inorganic Chemistry,9616326,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/10/30 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2006/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/10/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Inorg Chem. 2007 Jun;12(5):655-65. doi: 10.1007/s00775-007-0214-1.

Puberty started spontaneously in all patients. However, all except four patients had normal testosterone levels with elevated LH, indicating partial Leydig cell dysfunction. Standard deviation scores of testicular volume at last evaluation were statistically lower in those who had received irradiation without gonadal shield compared to those with (-2.04+/-0.45 vs -0.30+/-1.17, respectively, P<0.005), suggesting damage of testicular germinal epithelium owing to gonadal irradiation.

The immunomagnetic beads were applied to purify CD133 positive cells. CD133+ tumor cells were cultured in vitro to observe their ability to proliferate and differentiate. RESULTS: Only a small proportion (<5%) of cells in the Hep-2 cell line expressed CD133.

PTEN also has various cellular function including cell growth, proliferation, migration and differentiation. Thus, possible relationships between the two molecules are suggested. TNF-alpha has been known to downregulate PTEN via NF-kappaB pathway in the human colon cell line, HT-29. However, here we show the opposite finding that TNF-alpha upregulates PTEN via activation of NF-kappaB in human leukemic cells. TNF-alpha increased PTEN expression at HL-60 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but the response was abolished by disruption of NF-kappaB with p65 antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. We found that TNF-alpha activated the NF-kappaB pathways, evidenced by the translocation of p65 to the nucleus in TNF-alpha-treated cells.

METHODS: Analysis of 1970-2001 cancer data from the New Zealand Cancer Registry was undertaken for New Plymouth and the rest of New Zealand. RESULTS: There is no evidence of an increased cancer risk apart from one period (1970-74), which falls partly outside the 1962-1987 manufacturing period if 10-year latency is assumed. For 1970-74, there was an elevated risk for all cancer incidence (SIR = 111, 95% CI 104-119), and for two of the four specific cancers that are associated with dioxin exposure (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma SIR = 175, 95% CI 121-246 and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia SIR = 251, 95% CI 144-408). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results do not suggest an increased cancer risk among the New Plymouth population related to the period of 2,4,5-T manufacture, although the study's limitations mean the possibility of an undetectable small elevation in cancer risk cannot be excluded. Although TCDD exposure in the first few years of 2,4,5-T manufacture may have contributed to cancer incidence in 1970-74, unknown exposure(s) before the start of 2,4,5-T manufacture and chance are also possible explanations.","['Read, Deborah', 'Wright, Craig', 'Weinstein, Philip', 'Borman, Barry']","['Read D', 'Wright C', 'Weinstein P', 'Borman B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Public Health,Australian and New Zealand journal of public health,9611095,,2007/03/06 09:00,2007/04/10 09:00,['2007/03/06 09:00'],"['2007/03/06 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/06 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Public Health. 2007 Feb;31(1):13-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00003.x.,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '0 (Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins)', '9Q963S4YMX (2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid)']",IM,,"['2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid/chemical synthesis', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*toxicity', 'Chemical Industry', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*epidemiology/*mortality', 'New Zealand/epidemiology', 'Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins/*toxicity', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Residence Characteristics/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Assessment', 'Time']",['10.1111/j.1753-6405.2007.00003.x [doi]'],,"['Ministry of Health, New Zealand. deborah_read@moh.govt.nz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antifolate methotrexate has been rationally-designed nearly 60 years ago to potently block the folate-dependent enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) thereby achieving temporary remissions in childhood acute leukemia. Recently, the novel antifolates raltitrexed and pemetrexed that target thymidylate synthase (TS) and glycineamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GARTF) were introduced for the treatment of colorectal cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma. (Anti)folates are divalent anions which predominantly use the reduced folate carrier (RFC) for their cellular uptake. (Anti)folates are retained intracellularly via polyglutamylation catalyzed by folylpoly-gamma-glutamate synthetase (FPGS). As the intracellular concentration of antifolates is critical for their pharmacologic activity, polyglutamylation is a key determinant of antifolate cytotoxicity. However, anticancer drug resistance phenomena pose major obstacles towards curative cancer chemotherapy. Pre-clinical and clinical studies have identified a plethora of mechanisms of antifolate-resistance; these are frequently associated with qualitative and/or quantitative alterations in influx and/or efflux transporters of (anti)folates as well as in folate-dependent enzymes. These include inactivating mutations and/or down-regulation of the RFC and various alterations in the target enzymes DHFR, TS and FPGS. Furthermore, it has been recently shown that members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily including multidrug resistance proteins (MRP/ABCC) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) are low affinity, high capacity ATP-driven (anti)folate efflux transporters. This transport activity is in addition to their established facility to extrude multiple cytotoxic agents. Hence, by actively extruding antifolates, overexpressed MRPs and/or BCRP confer antifolate resistance. Moreover, down-regulation of MRPs and/or BCRP results in decreased folate efflux thereby leading to expansion of the intracellular folate pool and antifolate resistance. This chapter reviews and discusses the panoply of molecular modalities of antifolate-resistance in pre-clinical tumor cell systems in vitro and in vivo as well as in cancer patients. Currently emerging novel strategies for the overcoming of antifolate-resistance are presented. Finally, experimental evidence is provided that the identification and characterization of the molecular mechanisms of antifolate-resistance may prove instrumental in the future development of rationally-based novel antifolates and strategies that could conceivably overcome drug-resistance phenomena.","['Assaraf, Yehuda G']",['Assaraf YG'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Metastasis Rev,Cancer metastasis reviews,8605731,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2007 Mar;26(1):153-81. doi: 10.1007/s10555-007-9049-z.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism']",['10.1007/s10555-007-9049-z [doi]'],,"['The Fred Wyszkowski Cancer Research Laboratory, Department of Biology, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, 32000, Israel. assaraf@tx.technion.ac.il']",,,,250,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is being tested in phase II studies in various types of cancers. We have shown that ATO is a potent inducer of apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells, engaging primarily the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in cells expressing w.t. p53 and the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in cells expressing mutant p53. To further establish the differential apoptotic signals of ATO in relation to p53 functional status we studied the activation of the intrinsic and the extrinsic apoptotic pathways in IM9 myeloma cells expressing w.t. p53 following silencing of p53 and p21 with the corresponding SiRNAs-GFP constructs. In untransfected cells or in cells transfected with GFP-empty vector construct we observed weak apoptosis concomitant with mild depolarization of mitochondrial membrane, depletion of reduced glutathione and release of cytochrome c. Following silencing of p53 or p21 we observed extensive apoptosis concomitant with extensive depolarization of mitochondrial membrane and depletion of reduced glutathione. We also observed in these cells activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through upregulation of APO2/TRAIL and APO2/TRAIL-R2, activation of caspase 8, degradation of FLIP-L and release of apoptosis inducing factors from mitochondria, instead of cytochrome c. In addition, we observed marked activation of the MAP kinase pathway and dephosphorylation of Akt in p53 or p21 silenced cells. Hence, silencing of p53 or p21 in IM9 myeloma cells results in diversion of apoptosis to the extrinsic pathway and sensitization of myeloma cells to ATO.","['Kircelli, Fatih', 'Akay, Cagla', 'Gazitt, Yair']","['Kircelli F', 'Akay C', 'Gazitt Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Apr;30(4):993-1001.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Cytidine Deaminase/analysis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/analysis/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",,,"['The University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX 78284, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that LIF promotes cell proliferation in some human carcinoma cells through c-fos, jun-B and cyclin-E expression. In the present study, we analyzed the regulation of LIF and its receptor (LIFR) expression in pancreatic carcinoma cells. Seven pancreatic carcinoma cells expressed constitutively LIF and its heterodimer receptor (LIFR and gp130) mRNA in RPMI-1640 medium without FBS. The amount of LIF immunoreactive protein was 132.5+/-52 pg/10(6) cells in culture supernatants without FBS. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, or LIF, enhanced the expression of LIF mRNA in Hs-700T and Hs-766T cells. Addition of LIF significantly induced cell proliferation of Hs700T in 13 days LIF dose-dependently. However, anti-LIF IgG failed to suppress cell proliferation in Hs-700T cells. LIF acted as a paracrine growth factor in Hs-700T cells, which expressed low amount of LIF without stimuli. Cellular signal transductions by LIF was down-regulated by inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), and Ca/Calmodulin. LIF induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Moreover, exogenous LIF upregulated the expression of LIFR mRNA. Antisense LIFR oligonucleotide significantly suppressed cell growth in the presence of LIF in Hs-700T cells. These results suggest that cytokine network might alter the expression and responsiveness to LIF in tumor microenvironment.","['Kamohara, Hidenobu', 'Ogawa, Michio', 'Ishiko, Takatoshi', 'Sakamoto, Kiyoshi', 'Baba, Hideo']","['Kamohara H', 'Ogawa M', 'Ishiko T', 'Sakamoto K', 'Baba H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Apr;30(4):977-83.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,,"['Carcinoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,,"['Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-8556, Japan. kamo.kamo@tkg.bbiq.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although at 41 degrees C in absence of ONC the incidence of apoptosis was elevated compared to 37 degrees C the cytotoxicity of ONC was further enhanced and the overall pro-apoptotic effect was above the level of additive effects of ONC plus that of 41 degrees C-hyperthermia. While the mechanism of the observed enhancement of ONC cytotoxicity is currently under investigation, the findings suggest that a combination of ONC and mild hyperthermia should be explored to increase effectiveness of ONC in cancer treatment.","['Halicka, H Dorota', 'Ardelt, Barbara', 'Shogen, Kuslima', 'Darzynkiewicz, Zbigniew']","['Halicka HD', 'Ardelt B', 'Shogen K', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/05/05 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2007 Apr;30(4):841-7.,"['EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'ZE15FIT23E (ranpirnase)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/analysis/metabolism', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Ribonucleases/*drug effects', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,"['Brander Cancer Research Institute and Department of Pathology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, NY 10595, USA.']","['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-27/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28 704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of p53 is regulated by recruitment into promyelocytic leukemia (PML)-nuclear bodies (NBs) as well as by stabilization through posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Here we found that MORC3 (microrchidia3)-ATPase activated p53 and induced cellular senescence in normal human and mouse fibroblasts but not p53-/- fibroblasts. Conversely, genotoxic stress-induced phosphorylation and stabilization of p53 but barely increased its transcriptional activity in Morc3-/- fibroblasts. MORC3 localized on PML-NBs in presence of PML and mediated recruitment of p53 and CREB-binding protein (CBP) into PML-NBs. In contrast, expression of ATPase activity-deficient mutant MORC3-E35A or siRNA repression of MORC3 impaired the localization of p53 and Sp100 but not CBP on PML-NBs. These results suggest that MORC3 regulates p53 activity and localization into PML-NBs.

RUNX1/ETO has a modular structure and contains several docking sites for heterologous proteins, including transcriptional co-repressors like N-CoR, SMART, and mSIN3A. RUNX1/ETO is found in high molecular weight complexes, which are crucial for the block in myeloid differentiation observed in RUNX1/ETO-transformed cells. Essential for high molecular weight complex formation is the nervy homology region 2 (NHR2) within ETO, which serves as interacting surface for oligomerization as well as association with members of the ETO protein family. Here, we show that the expression of a fusion peptide consisting of 128 amino acids (NC128), including the entire NHR2 domain of ETO, disrupts the stability of the RUNX1/ETO high molecular weight complexes, restores transcription of RUNX1/ETO target genes, and reverts the differentiation block induced by RUNX1/ETO in myeloid cells. In the presence of NC128, RUNX1/ETO-transformed cells lose their progenitor cell characteristics, are arrested in cell cycle progression, and undergo cell death. Our results indicate that selective interference with the oligomerization domain of ETO could provide a promising strategy to inhibit the oncogenic properties of the leukemia-associated fusion protein RUNX1/ETO.","['Wichmann, Christian', 'Chen, Linping', 'Heinrich, Markus', 'Baus, Daniela', 'Pfitzner, Edith', 'Zornig, Martin', 'Ottmann, Oliver G', 'Grez, Manuel']","['Wichmann C', 'Chen L', 'Heinrich M', 'Baus D', 'Pfitzner E', 'Zornig M', 'Ottmann OG', 'Grez M']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;67(5):2280-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3360.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic']","['67/5/2280 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3360 [doi]']",,"['Institute for Biomedical Research, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Paul-Ehrlich-Strasse 42-44, 60596 Frankfurt/M, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also in clinical trials for treating patients with solid tumors. The identification of molecular markers predictive of response to dasatinib could assist in clinical development by selecting patients most likely to derive clinical benefit. Using baseline gene expression profiling of a panel of 23 breast cancer cell lines, we identified genomic signatures highly correlated with in vitro sensitivity to dasatinib. The ability of these signatures to predict dasatinib sensitivity was further confirmed and validated in independent test cell lines. A six-gene model was used to correctly predict dasatinib sensitivity in 11 out of 12 (92%) additional breast and 19 out of 23 (83%) lung cancer cell lines. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemical assays further confirmed the differential expression pattern of selected markers. Finally, these gene signatures were observed in a subset of primary breast, lung, and ovarian tumors suggesting potential utility in patient selection. The subset of breast cancer patients expressing the dasatinib-sensitive signature includes a distinct clinical and molecular subgroup: the so-called ""triple negative"" (i.e., estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and HER2-negative) or ""basal"" breast cancer subtype. This patient population has a poor prognosis and currently has few effective treatment options. Our results implicate that dasatinib may represent a valuable treatment option in this difficult-to-treat population. To test this hypothesis, clinical studies are now under way to determine the activity of dasatinib in these patients.","['Huang, Fei', 'Reeves, Karen', 'Han, Xia', 'Fairchild, Craig', 'Platero, Suso', 'Wong, Tai W', 'Lee, Francis', 'Shaw, Peter', 'Clark, Edwin']","['Huang F', 'Reeves K', 'Han X', 'Fairchild C', 'Platero S', 'Wong TW', 'Lee F', 'Shaw P', 'Clark E']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;67(5):2226-38. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3633.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dasatinib', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', '*Patient Selection', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/*therapeutic use']","['67/5/2226 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-3633 [doi]']",,"['Departments of Clinical Discovery and Oncology Discovery, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Princeton, NJ 08543, USA. fei.huang@bms.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), like SDF-1, is secreted by bone marrow stroma and directs the regeneration of skeletal muscles, we examined whether the LIF-LIF receptor (LIF-R) axis affects the biology of rhabdomyosarcoma cells. We found that in rhabdomyosarcoma cells, LIF stimulates the following: (a) phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase p42/44, AKT, and signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, (b) adhesion and chemotaxis, and (c) increased resistance to cytostatics. To compare the biological effects of LIF versus SDF-1, we examined the RH30 cell line, which is highly responsive to both ligands, and found that the chemotaxis of these cells is significantly reduced when the inhibitors of both receptors (T140 for CXCR4 and gp190 blocking antibody for LIF-R) are added simultaneously. Subsequently, by using repetitive chemotaxis to LIF or SDF-1, we selected from the RH30 line subpopulations of cells that respond to LIF but not SDF-1 (RH30-L) or to SDF-1 but not LIF (RH30-S). We found that (a) RH30-L cells seed better to the bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes of immunodeficient mice than RH30-S cells and (b) mice inoculated i.m. with the RH30-L cells had more rhabdomyosarcoma cells in the bone marrow and lung after 6 weeks. Thus, we present the first evidence that the LIF-LIF-R axis may direct rhabdomyosarcoma metastasis. Further, because we showed that the in vivo metastasis of RH30 cells is inhibited by small interfering RNA against LIF-R, molecular targeting of this axis could become a new strategy to control the metastasis of rhabdomyosarcoma.","['Wysoczynski, Marcin', 'Miekus, Katarzyna', 'Jankowski, Kacper', 'Wanzeck, Jens', 'Bertolone, Salvatore', 'Janowska-Wieczorek, Anna', 'Ratajczak, Janina', 'Ratajczak, Mariusz Z']","['Wysoczynski M', 'Miekus K', 'Jankowski K', 'Wanzeck J', 'Bertolone S', 'Janowska-Wieczorek A', 'Ratajczak J', 'Ratajczak MZ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;67(5):2131-40. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1021.,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncostatin M/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/metabolism', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/metabolism/*pathology']","['67/5/2131 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-1021 [doi]']",,"['James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, 580 South Preston Street, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['R01 CA 106281-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This first report of a CD4(+) Th response to ALK provides valuable information for developing future immunotherapeutic options for ALK-positive ALCL patients who fail to respond well to conventional therapies.","['Ait-Tahar, Kamel', 'Barnardo, Martin C N', 'Pulford, Karen']","['Ait-Tahar K', 'Barnardo MC', 'Pulford K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;67(5):1898-901. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4427.,"['0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ALK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology']","['67/5/1898 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-06-4427 [doi]']",,"['Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Leukemia Research Fund Immunodiagnostics Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom. kamel.ait-tahar@ndcls.ox.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, prenatal exposure to chemicals that inhibit topoisomerase II could plausibly contribute to the incidence of childhood leukemia. The NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme is involved in the metabolism of topoisomerase II-inhibiting chemicals. A functional polymorphism (C609T) associated with reduced activity has been identified on the NQO1 gene. To assess its role in the etiology of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the authors studied transmission of the variant T allele in the families (parents and grandparents) of 657 affected children in Quebec, Canada (1980-2000). Log-linear models that stratified on parental or grandparental mating types were used. Prenatal exposure to potential topoisomerase II inhibitors such as benzene and maternal smoking was studied, as well as interactions between the variant and these exposures. The variant allele was transmitted to cases more frequently than expected (for one or two copies of the allele vs. none, relative risk = 1.39, 95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.79). There was no evidence of a maternally mediated genetic effect on risk, based on a log-linear assessment of genetic symmetry between mothers and fathers, nor was there evidence of interaction between the studied maternal exposures and the child or maternal variant.","['Infante-Rivard, Claire', 'Vermunt, Jeroen K', 'Weinberg, Clarice R']","['Infante-Rivard C', 'Vermunt JK', 'Weinberg CR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,PMC2080583,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/07/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2007 Jun 1;165(11):1248-54. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwm022.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of etoposide and 17-AAG in leukemia cells and the roles of Hsp90, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), Rad51, and topoisomerase II in this inhibition. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The single and combined effects of 17-AAG and etoposide and the mechanism of these effects were evaluated. FLT3 and the DNA repair-related proteins, Chk1 and Rad51, were studied in small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced cell growth inhibition experiments in human leukemia cells with wild-type or mutated FLT3. RESULTS: We found that etoposide and the Hsp90/FLT3 inhibitor 17-AAG, had synergistic inhibitory effects on FLT3(+) MLL-fusion gene leukemia cells. Cells with an internal tandem duplication (ITD) FLT3 (Molm13 and MV4;11) were more sensitive to etoposide/17-AAG than leukemias with wild-type FLT3 (HPB-Null and RS4;11). A critical role for FLT3 was shown in experiments with FLT3 ligand and siRNA targeted to FLT3. An important role for topoisomerase II and the DNA repair-related proteins, Chk1 and Rad51, in the synergistic effects was suggested from the results. CONCLUSIONS: The repair of potentially lethal DNA damage by etoposide in leukemia cells is dependent on intact and functioning FLT3 especially leukemias with ITD-FLT3. These data suggest a rational therapeutic strategy for FLT3(+) leukemias that combines etoposide or other DNA-damaging agents with Hsp90/FLT3 inhibitors such as 17-AAG.","['Yao, Qing', 'Weigel, Brenda', 'Kersey, John']","['Yao Q', 'Weigel B', 'Kersey J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 1;13(5):1591-600. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1750.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (CHEK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Checkpoint Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Rad51 Recombinase)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Checkpoint Kinase 1', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Rad51 Recombinase/drug effects/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/drug effects/metabolism']","['13/5/1591 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1750 [doi]']",,"['The Cancer Center, University of Minnesota MMC 806, 420 Delaware St. SE, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA.']",['CA087053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Bortezomib was administered twice weekly for 2 consecutive weeks at either 1.3 or 1.7 mg/m(2) dose followed by a 1-week rest. Bortezomib pharmacokinetics and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity were evaluated during the first treatment cycle. RESULTS: Twelve patients (nine with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three with acute myelogenous leukemia), median age 11 years (range, 1-18 years), were enrolled between May 2004 and November 2005, of whom seven were not fully evaluable for toxicity due to rapidly progressive disease or uncontrolled infection. Dose-limiting toxicities occurred in two patients at the 1.7 mg/m(2) dose level. One patient experienced grade 3 confusion and the other patient had grade 4 febrile neutropenia associated with grade 4 hypotension and grade 3 creatinine. Pharmacokinetic analysis at 1.3 mg/m(2) revealed a clearance of 11 mL/h/m(2), a central volume of distribution of 6.7 L/m(2), and a terminal half-life of 12.6 h. NF-kappaB activity was examined in five patients and was noted to transiently increase and then decrease 4- to 6-fold by 24 h following bortezomib in two patients. There were no objective clinical responses. CONCLUSIONS: For children with leukemia, the recommended phase 2 dose of bortezomib, administered twice weekly for 2 weeks followed by a 1-week rest, is 1.3 mg/m(2)/dose.

Obatoclax (GX015-070) is a novel, small-molecule antagonist of the BH3-binding groove of the Bcl family of proteins. We show that GX015-070 inhibits the binding of Bak to Mcl-1, up-regulates Bim, induces cytochrome c release, and activates capase-3 in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), confirming the predicted mechanism of action. Consequently, GX015-070 potently inhibited the viability of 15 of 16 HMCLs (mean IC(50) of 246 nM), including those resistant to melphalan and dexamethasone. In combination studies, GX015-070 enhanced the antimyeloma activity induced by melphalan, dexamethasone, or bortezomib. Sensitivity to GX015-070 correlated with the absence or near absence of Bcl-x(L). Coculture with interleukin-6 or adherence to bone marrow stroma conferred modest resistance; however, it did not overcome GX015-070-induced cytotoxicity. Of importance, GX015-070 as a single agent induced potent cytotoxic responses against patient-derived tumor cells. GX015-070 inhibited normal bone marrow-derived colony formation; however, cytotoxicity to human blood lymphocytes was not observed.

In these cultures, inclusion of the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the medium increases neuronal survival and the number of bipolar neurons. Here we tested effects of two other LIF-type cytokines (ciliary neurotrophic factor, CNTF; and human recombinant oncostatin M, hOSM) and of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) on survival, morphology and neurite lengths of neurons in cultures of dissociated spiral ganglion. Like LIF, CNTF and hOSM increased neuronal survival and the number of surviving bipolar neurons. BMP4 also increased neuronal survival, but unlike LIF, CNTF and hOSM, increased the number of monopolar neurons and neurons with no neurites. In addition, population histograms demonstrate that the population lengths of the longer and shorter neurites of bipolar neurons were shorter in BMP4 containing cultures than in control or LIF cultures. When LIF and BMP4 were simultaneously added to the cultures, the BMP4 effects predominated. These experiments demonstrate that exposure to different environmental conditions can result in different morphologies in the surviving population of spiral ganglion neurons in culture.","['Whitlon, D S', 'Grover, M', 'Tristano, J', 'Williams, T', 'Coulson, M T']","['Whitlon DS', 'Grover M', 'Tristano J', 'Williams T', 'Coulson MT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,PMC2532701,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/19 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2007 May 11;146(2):833-40. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.01.036.

Attempts to change its receptor usage through the insertion of ligands at various sites have been met with varying success. We have tested several sites in Env for insertion of apelin, a small peptide ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor APJ. Although most of the chimeric envelopes had retained their ability to infect mouse cells none showed APJ-dependent entry. Insertion of a peptide linker Ser-Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly at either side of the apelin motif in one of the chimeric envelopes resulted in an ability of the chimeric envelope to bind to and infect cells through APJ although with low efficiency. Several linker sequences isolated by library selection for APJ-dependent infection were found to support entry, however none more efficiently than the original SGGSG-linker.

Here, we find that ATO treatment of NB4 and K562 leukemic cells induces activation of ASK1. ASK1 activation was induced most significantly at low concentrations of ATO, where G2/M arrest but not apoptosis was induced. On the other hand, ATO barely activated ASK1 at high concentrations, where apoptosis as well as activation of JNK and p38 was induced significantly. ATO-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), while the ASK1 activation was suppressed by cotreatment with an antioxidant, N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from ASK1-deficient mice were more susceptible to ATO-induced apoptosis than control MEFs. Furthermore, ATO at the low concentration induced significant apoptosis in K562 cells when ASK1 was knocked down by siRNA. These results indicate that ASK1 is activated by ATO through ROS accumulation and may negatively regulate apoptosis in leukemic cells without activating p38 and JNK.","['Yan, Weihua', 'Arai, Ayako', 'Aoki, Mae', 'Ichijo, Hidenori', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Yan W', 'Arai A', 'Aoki M', 'Ichijo H', 'Miura O']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/18 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2007/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/18 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2007 Apr 20;355(4):1038-44. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2007.02.064.

Leukaemic cells produce larger amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than non-leukaemic cells as they are under a continual state of oxidative siege. So, this study was performed on 20 patients with chronic leukaemia from the Oncology Centre, Mansoura University. We measured leucocytic H(2)O(2) concentrations and lipid peroxidation as serum malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, serum total antioxidant activity, plasma ascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid concentrations, blood reduced glutathione concentration, haemolysate G6PD activity, blood catalase activity, serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and serum anti-dsDNA concentration. We found that chronic leukaemia patients showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in leucocytic H(2)O(2), serum MDA concentration and total antioxidant activity either before or after treatment as compared with control group. Also, there was a significant increase in the other parameters (glutathione, catalase and SOD) either before or after treatment, but we found a significant decrease in ascorbic acid concentration and G6PD activity. There was a significant increase in anti-dsDNA concentration either before or after treatment. It can be concluded that leukaemic patients produce larger amounts of ROS than non-leukaemic patients. Also, the increase in antioxidant activity in leukaemic patients is not high enough to counteract the harmful effects of free radicals. This scenario becomes worse after administration of chemotherapy.","['Al-Gayyar, Mohammed M H', 'Eissa, Laila A', 'Rabie, Ahmed M', 'El-Gayar, Amal M']","['Al-Gayyar MM', 'Eissa LA', 'Rabie AM', 'El-Gayar AM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/28 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2007 Mar;59(3):409-17. doi: 10.1211/jpp.59.3.0011.,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/*metabolism', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",['10.1211/jpp.59.3.0011 [doi]'],,"['Dept. of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The controls were randomly selected from the French population and were frequency matched with the cases on age and gender. Cancer history in first- and second-degree relatives was reported by the mothers in a structured telephone questionnaire that was the same for the cases and controls. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated using an unconditional regression model taking into account the stratification variables and potential confounders.

The ORs were higher when at least 2 relatives had a history of cancer or when 1 case occurred before age 46 years. Only HL was significantly associated with a family history of hematopoietic malignancies (OR = 2.0 [1.0-3.8]), mainly because of a significant association with a history of HL (OR = 5.4 [1.3-22]).

We studied cytotoxic interactions of a FLT3 inhibitor, PKC412, with eight conventional antileukemic agents (cytarabine, doxorubicin, idarubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and vincristine) using three leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3 mutations (MOLM13, MOLM14 and MV4-11) and five leukemia cell lines without FLT3 mutations (KOPB-26, THP-1, BALL-1, KG-1 and U937). PKC412 showed synergistic effects with all agents studied except methotrexate for FLT3-mutated cell lines in isobologram analysis. In contrast, PKC412 was rather antagonistic to most drugs, except for 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide and vincristine, in leukemia cell lines without FLT3 mutations. Cell-cycle analysis revealed that PKC412 induced G1 arrest in leukemia cell lines carrying FLT3 mutations, whereas it arrested cells in G2/M phase in the absence of FLT3 mutations, which may underlie the divergent cytotoxic interactions. These results suggest that the simultaneous administration of PKC412 and other agents except methotrexate is clinically effective against FLT3 mutation-positive leukemias, whereas it would be of little benefit for FLT3 mutation-negative leukemias.

Using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay specific to the mature miRNA, the expression level of a selected group of haematopoietic tissue-specific miRNAs was measured across a set of 30 primary adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with a normal karyotype. The expression levels of each miRNA were correlated with the genome-wide mRNA expression profiles in the same leukaemias. This revealed that miR-181a correlated strongly with the AML morphological sub-type and with the expression of genes previously identified through sequence analysis as potential interaction targets.

We had previously found that imatinib increases the cellular clearance of intracellular protein aggregates by targeting the abl pathway and thereby upregulating lysosomal activity. Here, we describe that imatinib dose dependently activates the cellular autophagy machinery in mammalian cells, independently of tissue type, species origin or immortalization status of cells. Autophagy is an archetypical cellular degradation mechanism implicated in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Our data link for the first time the process of autophagy with the mode of action of imatinib. Induction of autophagy might represent an additional mechanism of imatinib to induce growth arrest, promote apoptosis in cancer cells and eventually even promote tumour regression.","['Ertmer, A', 'Huber, V', 'Gilch, S', 'Yoshimori, T', 'Erfle, V', 'Duyster, J', 'Elsasser, H-P', 'Schatzl, H M']","['Ertmer A', 'Huber V', 'Gilch S', 'Yoshimori T', 'Erfle V', 'Duyster J', 'Elsasser HP', 'Schatzl HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/06/05 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2007 May;21(5):936-42. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2404606.

Quantitative analysis of genes expressed in these different CML subsets revealed a differentiation-associated decrease in IL-3 and G-CSF transcripts, a much more profound decrease in expression of BCR-ABL than predicted by changes in BCR expression, decreasing expression of ABCB1/MDR and ABCG2 and increasing expression of OCT1. p210(BCR-ABL) and kinase activity were also higher in the lin(-)CD34(+)CD38(-) cells and formal evidence that increasing BCR-ABL expression decreases IM sensitivity was obtained from experiments with a cell line model.

In the present study, we address molecular and cell biologic features of blasts persisting after 1 week of induction glucocorticoid therapy. Genome-wide gene expression analysis of leukemic samples from precursor B-cell ALL patients (n=18) identified a set of genes differentially expressed in blasts at diagnosis day 0 (d0) and persisting on day 8 (d8). Expression changes indicate a shift towards mature B cells, inhibition of cell cycling and increased expression of adhesion (CD11b/ITGAM) and cytokine (CD119/IFNGR1) receptors. A direct comparison with normal B cells, which are largely therapy resistant, confirmed the differentiation shift at the mRNA (n=10) and protein (n=109) levels. Flow cytometric analysis in independent cohorts of patients confirmed both a decreased proliferative activity (n=13) and the upregulation of CD11b and CD119 (n=29) in d8 blasts. The differentiation shift and low proliferative activity in d8 blasts may account for the persistence of blasts during therapy and affect their sensitivity to further therapeutic treatment.

Recent findings suggested that the transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 is the major oncogene for the majority of T-ALL cases. In these cases activating mutations of NOTCH1 are responsible for the transformation of developing T cell progenitors. These observations prompted us to study the mechanisms of Notch1-induced T cell transformation. Using parallel studies in T cell progenitors and established T-ALL lines we have demonstrated that the NFkappaB signaling pathway is targeted and induced by Notch1 activation. Our studies suggested that NFkappaB activation by Notch1 can be direct, as Notch1 can bind and activate the promoters of the RELB and NFkappaB2 factors and indirect, as Notch1 can form a complex with the NFkappaB kinase IKK. NFkappaB appears to be important for the development of the disease as suppression of the pathway antagonizes T cell transformation both in vitro and in vivo, using animal models of T-ALL. We believe that these findings could be important for the understanding of Notch1 signaling and the therapeutic treatment of T-ALL.","['Aifantis, Iannis', 'Vilimas, Tomas', 'Buonamici, Silvia']","['Aifantis I', 'Vilimas T', 'Buonamici S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/14 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2007 Feb 15;6(4):403-6. doi: 10.4161/cc.6.4.3858.

First, we demonstrated that p21Waf1 expression was increased by TPA in other leukemia cell lines also, including THP-1, U937, and KG-1, which differentiate into monocytes/macrophages by TPA. Secondly, we demonstrated the signal transduction pathways of cyclin D1 and p21Waf1 expressions in TPA-treated HL60 cells. Induction of cyclin D1 expression in TPA-treated HL60 cells was inhibited with protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059. Induction of p21Waf1 expression in TPA-treated HL60 cells was inhibited with PKC inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide I and Go6976, MEK inhibitor PD98059, and p38 mitogen-actibated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitor SB202190. Thus, cyclin D1 and p21Waf1 expressions are considered to be induced via PKC and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathways in TPA-treated HL60 cells. The upregulation of p21Waf1 seems to play a critical role in TPA-induced cell differentiation by suppressing cyclin dependent kinase activity , while the upregulation of cyclin D1 seems to be compensated by p21Waf1.","['Matsumoto, Eriko', 'Hatanaka, Michiyo', 'Bohgaki, Miyako', 'Maeda, Sakan']","['Matsumoto E', 'Hatanaka M', 'Bohgaki M', 'Maeda S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Kobe J Med Sci,The Kobe journal of medical sciences,0413531,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Kobe J Med Sci. 2006;52(6):181-94.,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*biosynthesis', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",,,"['Department of Medical Technology, Kobe-Tokiwa College, Kobe, Japan. ematsumoto@kobe-tokiwa.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested that upregulation of HO-1 might provide cytoprotection and immunomodulatory functions in addition to its obvious role in heme metabolism. In this study, we examined whether HO-1 was upregulated following degranulation in mast cells that initiate vigorous immunity reactions. To trigger degranulation, rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells were passively sensitized using an antiserum collected from ovalbumin (OA) immunized-Brown Norway rats, and the cells were stimulated by treatment with OA. Degranulation was confirmed by measuring the release of beta-hexosaminidase. HO-1 mRNA and presence of HO-1 protein were detected using Northern blot and Western blot analyses, respectively. The effect of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) on HO-1 expression was also tested. HO-1 mRNA transiently increased at 1--2 h after RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated to degranulate. Its mRNA increases were dependent on the extent of degranulation. Following the upregulation of HO-1 mRNA, HO-1 protein was also increased. We also detected intracellular production of reactive oxygen species following degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. NAC attenuated the HO-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. This is the first report to reveal induction of both HO-1 mRNA and protein by degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. We showed that NAC inhibited HO-1 upregulation. These results suggest that oxidative stress in activated RBL-2H3 cells results in the upregulation of HO-1.","['Yasui, Yumiko', 'Sasao, Emiko', 'Sakata, Masaru', 'Matsui, Nobuaki', 'Fukuishi, Nobuyuki', 'Akagi, Reiko', 'Akagi, Masaaki']","['Yasui Y', 'Sasao E', 'Sakata M', 'Matsui N', 'Fukuishi N', 'Akagi R', 'Akagi M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Biol Pharm Bull,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,9311984,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/08/21 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Pharm Bull. 2007 Mar;30(3):443-6. doi: 10.1248/bpb.30.443.,"[""0 (2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate)"", '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Metalloporphyrins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0KAE1U0G7Q (tin mesoporphyrin)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'T1C2UGS05F (ponceau S)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Azo Compounds/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Metalloporphyrins/pharmacology', 'Ovalbumin/immunology/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred BN', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']","['JST.JSTAGE/bpb/30.443 [pii]', '10.1248/bpb.30.443 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Tokushima Bunri University. yumikoy@ph.bunri-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

S and E expressions were found in 83.8 and 20.3% of the cases, respectively. S was detected in 90%, 76.5% and E was detected in 17.5%, 23.5% of the cases with AML and ALL, respectively. There was a significant correlation between S and E (r=0.30 p=0.01). Mortality rate was higher in E(-) cases than E(+) cases (83.1 % versus 66.7%) (p=0.04). The median DFS and OS rates were shorter in S(+) and E(-) cases. In subgroup analysis, there was not a significant difference for OS between S(-) and S(+) cases and E(-) and E(+) cases in ALL group. The median OS rate was significantly longer in S(-) cases than S(+) cases, and longer in E(+) cases than E(-) in AML groups (p=0.04, 0.001, respectively). OS and DFS rates were longest in S(-) E(+) cases and shortest in S(+) E(-) cases (p=0.04 and 0.03, respectively). In multivariate analyses EPR1 negativity was found to be an independent poor risk factor for survival (OR: 2.4, p=0.02). In conclusion S expression is a bad prognostic indicator in cases with acute leukemia especially in AML. S negativity and E positivity show good clinical outcome in acute leukemias. E expression is important due to its property of the possible natural anti-sense of the S.","['Oto, Ozgur Akin', 'Paydas, Semra', 'Tanriverdi, Kahraman', 'Seydaoglu, Gulsah', 'Yavuz, Sinan', 'Disel, Umut']","['Oto OA', 'Paydas S', 'Tanriverdi K', 'Seydaoglu G', 'Yavuz S', 'Disel U']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,2007/03/03 09:00,2008/01/30 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2006/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/08 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2007 Nov;31(11):1495-501. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2007.01.005.

The main reason why putative PSC has not yet been identified is the lack of specific markers that may be used to isolate and purify them. In order to increase the list of potential PSC markers we have focused on the human pancreatic cells that express cell surface receptor CXCR4, a marker of stem cells derived from different adult tissues. Here we report that CXCR4-positive pancreatic cells express markers of pancreatic endocrine progenitors (neurogenin-3, nestin) and markers of pluripotent stem cells (Oct-4, Nanog, ABCG2, CD133, CD117). Upon in vitro differentiation, these cells form ILCC and produce key islet hormones including insulin.

It has been recognized that astrocytes promote neurogenic differentiation of NSPCs, suggesting the importance of cell-cell interactions between glial cells and NSPCs. Recent studies have demonstrated that microglia, one type of glial cells, play an important role in neurogenesis. However, little is known about how activated microglia control the proliferation and differentiation of NSPCs. In this study, we investigated the possibility that microglia-derived soluble factors regulate the behaviour of NSPCs. To this end, NSPCs and microglial cultures were obtained from rat embryonic day 16 subventricular zone (SVZ) and rat postnatal 1 day cortex, respectively, and the conditioned medium from microglia was prepared. Microglial-conditioned medium had no significant effect on the proliferation of NSPCs. In contrast, it increased the percentage of cells positive for a marker of astrocytes, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) during differentiation. The induction of astrocytic differentiation by microglial-conditioned medium was reduced by the inhibition of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activation of transcription (JAK/STAT) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. Furthermore, microglia-derived interleukin (IL)-6 and leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were identified as essential molecules for this astrocytic differentiation using neutralizing antibodies and recombinant cytokines. Our results suggest that microglia as well as astrocytes contribute to the integrity of the local environment of NSPCs, and at least IL-6 and LIF released by activated microglia promote astrocytic differentiation of NSPCs via the activation of the JAK/STAT and MAPK pathways.","['Nakanishi, Masaya', 'Niidome, Tetsuhiro', 'Matsuda, Satoru', 'Akaike, Akinori', 'Kihara, Takeshi', 'Sugimoto, Hachiro']","['Nakanishi M', 'Niidome T', 'Matsuda S', 'Akaike A', 'Kihara T', 'Sugimoto H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Eur J Neurosci,The European journal of neuroscience,8918110,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/05/03 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Neurosci. 2007 Feb;25(3):649-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05309.x.,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Communication/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Microglia/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'STAT Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Solubility', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']","['EJN5309 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1460-9568.2007.05309.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Neuroscience for Drug Discovery, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kyoto University, Yoshida-Shimoadachi-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P53 and Bax proteins were accumulated, and antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 was decreased in the tested cells in a time-dependent manner during TI treatment. TI also induced a substantial release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol. Hence, TI induced apoptosis in NB4 cells through a mitochondria-dependent pathway, which was associated with the activation of caspase-3 and -8. These results demonstrated that TI induces NB4 cell apoptosis through the inhibition of cell growth and the activation of the pathway of caspase-3 and -8 cascades.","['Huang, Guan-Jhong', 'Sheu, Ming-Jyh', 'Chen, Hsien-Jung', 'Chang, Yuan-Shiun', 'Lin, Yaw-Huei']","['Huang GJ', 'Sheu MJ', 'Chen HJ', 'Chang YS', 'Lin YH']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,,2007/03/03 09:00,2007/07/21 09:00,['2007/03/03 09:00'],"['2007/03/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/03 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2007 Apr 4;55(7):2548-53. doi: 10.1021/jf063008m.

Statistical methods for the adjustment of multiple testing have been discussed extensively in the literature. An important further challenge is the existence of dependence among test statistics due to reasons such as gene co-regulation. To plan large-scale genomic studies, sample size determination with appropriate adjustment for both multiple testing and potential dependency among test statistics is crucial to avoid an abundance of false-positive results and/or serious lack of power. We introduce a general approach for calculating sample sizes for two-way multiple comparisons in the presence of dependence among test statistics to ensure adequate overall power when the false discovery rates are controlled. The usefulness of the proposed method is demonstrated via numerical studies using both simulated data and real data from a well-known study of leukaemia.","['Shao, Yongzhao', 'Tseng, Chi-Hong']","['Shao Y', 'Tseng CH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Stat Med,Statistics in medicine,8215016,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/12/07 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/12/07 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Stat Med. 2007 Oct 15;26(23):4219-37. doi: 10.1002/sim.2862.,,IM,,"['*False Positive Reactions', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Testing/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', '*Sample Size', 'United States']",['10.1002/sim.2862 [doi]'],,"['Division of Biostatistics, NYU School of Medicine, 650 First Ave., Fifth Floor, New York, NY 10016, USA. shaoy01@med.nyu.edu']","['CA16087-23/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES00260-43/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as SU6668 and SU5416 (semaxanib) demonstrated poor pharmacologic properties and limited efficacy; therefore, sunitinib was rationally designed and chosen for its high bioavailability and its nanomolar-range potency against the antiangiogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs)--vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Sunitinib inhibits other tyrosine kinases including, KIT, FLT3, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1), and RET, which are involved in a number of malignancies including small-cell lung cancer, GI stromal tumors (GISTs), breast cancer, acute myelogenous leukemia, multiple endocrine neoplasia types 2A and 2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Sunitinib demonstrated robust antitumor activity in preclinical studies resulting not only in tumor growth inhibition, but tumor regression in models of colon cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, which were associated with inhibition of VEGFR and PDGFR phosphorylation. Clinical activity was demonstrated in neuroendocrine, colon, and breast cancers in phase II studies, whereas definitive efficacy has been demonstrated in advanced renal cell carcinoma and in imatinib-refractory GISTs, leading to US Food and Drug Administration approval of sunitinib for treatment of these two diseases. Studies investigating sunitinib alone in various tumor types and in combination with chemotherapy are ongoing. The clinical benchmarking of this small-molecule inhibitor of members of the split-kinase domain family of RTKs will lead to additional insights regarding the biology, potential biomarkers, and clinical utility of agents that target multiple signaling pathways in tumor, stromal, and endothelial compartments.","['Chow, Laura Q M', 'Eckhardt, S Gail']","['Chow LQ', 'Eckhardt SG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):884-96. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.06.3602.,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrroles)', 'V99T50803M (Sunitinib)']",IM,,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Design', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Indoles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sunitinib']","['25/7/884 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.06.3602 [doi]']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Aurora, CO 80045, USA.']",,,,112,['J Clin Oncol. 2007 Jul 1;25(19):2858-9; author reply 2859-61.

We report the outcome of adolescents treated on Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI; Boston, MA) ALL Consortium Protocols conducted between 1991 and 2000. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 844 patients aged 1 to 18 years, with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled onto two consecutive DFCI-ALL Consortium Protocols. We compared outcomes in three age groups: children aged 1 to 10 years (n = 685), young adolescents aged 10 to 15 years (n = 108), and older adolescents aged 15 to 18 years (n = 51). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, the 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for those aged 1 to 10 years was 85% (SE, 1%), compared with 77% (SE, 4%) for those aged 10 to 15 years, and 78% (SE, 6%) for those aged 15 to 18 years (P = .09). Adolescents were more likely to present with T-cell phenotype (P < .001) and less likely to have the TEL-AML1 fusion (P = .05). The incidence of pancreatitis and thromboembolic complications, but not asparaginase allergy, was higher in patients 10 years of age compared with those younger than 10 years. However, there was no difference in the rate of treatment-related complications between the 10- to 15-year and 15- to 18-year age groups. CONCLUSION: Adolescents were more likely to present at diagnosis with biologically higher risk disease (T-cell phenotype and absence of the TEL-AML1 fusion) and more likely to experience treatment-related complications than younger children. However, the 5-year EFS for older adolescents was 78% +/- 6%, which is superior to published outcomes for similarly aged patients treated with other pediatric and adult ALL regimens. Based on this experience, we currently are piloting our regimen in patients aged 18 to 50 years.","['Barry, Elly', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Barr, Ronald D', 'Clavell, Luis A', 'Hurwitz, Craig A', 'Moghrabi, Albert', 'Samson, Yvan', 'Schorin, Marshall', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Silverman, Lewis B']","['Barry E', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Neuberg D', 'Stevenson K', 'Loh ML', 'Asselin BL', 'Barr RD', 'Clavell LA', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Moghrabi A', 'Samson Y', 'Schorin M', 'Cohen HJ', 'Sallan SE', 'Silverman LB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/03/22 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/22 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2007 Mar 1;25(7):813-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2006.08.6397.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality']","['25/7/813 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2006.08.6397 [doi]']",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. elly_barry@dfci.harvard.edu']",['CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have suggested potential strategies by which the continued presence of host APCs can be exploited to prime strong donor immunity to tumors without the induction of GVHD.","['Chakraverty, Ronjon', 'Sykes, Megan']","['Chakraverty R', 'Sykes M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1896131,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/09/28 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jul 1;110(1):9-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-022038.

These small molecules have been shown to be involved in cancer, apoptosis, and cell metabolism. In the present study we provide an informative profile of the expression of miRNAs in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells using 2 independent and quantitative methods: miRNA cloning and quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of mature miRNAs. Both approaches show that miR-21 and miR-155 are dramatically overexpressed in patients with CLL, although the corresponding genomic loci are not amplified. miR-150 and miR-92 are also significantly deregulated in patients with CLL. In addition, we detected a marked miR-15a and miR-16 decrease in about 11% of cases. Finally, we identified a set of miRNAs whose expression correlates with biologic parameters of prognostic relevance, particularly with the mutational status of the IgV(H) genes. In summary, the results of this study offer for the first time a comprehensive and quantitative profile of miRNA expression in CLL and their healthy counterpart, suggesting that miRNAs could play a primary role in the disease itself.","['Fulci, Valerio', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Goldoni, Marina', 'Azzalin, Gianluca', 'Carucci, Nicoletta', 'Tavolaro, Simona', 'Castellano, Leandro', 'Magrelli, Armando', 'Citarella, Franca', 'Messina, Monica', 'Maggio, Roberta', 'Peragine, Nadia', 'Santangelo, Simona', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Landgraf, Pablo', 'Tuschl, Thomas', 'Weir, David B', 'Chien, Minchen', 'Russo, James J', 'Ju, Jingyue', 'Sheridan, Robert', 'Sander, Chris', 'Zavolan, Mihaela', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Foa, Robin', 'Macino, Giuseppe']","['Fulci V', 'Chiaretti S', 'Goldoni M', 'Azzalin G', 'Carucci N', 'Tavolaro S', 'Castellano L', 'Magrelli A', 'Citarella F', 'Messina M', 'Maggio R', 'Peragine N', 'Santangelo S', 'Mauro FR', 'Landgraf P', 'Tuschl T', 'Weir DB', 'Chien M', 'Russo JJ', 'Ju J', 'Sheridan R', 'Sander C', 'Zavolan M', 'Guarini A', 'Foa R', 'Macino G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 1;109(11):4944-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-12-062398.

Enforced expression of HOXA9 enhances proliferation of primitive blood cells, expands hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and leads to myeloid leukemia. Conversely, loss of HOXA9 inhibits proliferation and impairs HSC function. The pathways by which HOXA9 acts are largely unknown, and although HOXA9 is a transcription factor, few direct target genes have been identified. Our previous study suggested that HOXA9 positively regulates Pim1, an oncogenic kinase. The hematologic phenotypes of Hoxa9- and Pim1-deficient animals are strikingly similar. Here we show that HOXA9 protein binds to the Pim1 promoter and induces Pim1 mRNA and protein in hematopoietic cells. Pim1 protein is diminished in Hoxa9(-/-) cells, and Hoxa9 and Pim1 mRNA levels track together in early hematopoietic compartments. Induction of Pim1 protein by HOXA9 increases the phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic BAD protein, a target of Pim1. Hoxa9(-/-) cells show increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, defects that are ameliorated by reintroduction of Pim1. Thus Pim1 appears to be a direct transcriptional target of HOXA9 and a mediator of its antiapoptotic and proproliferative effects in early cells. Since HOXA9 is frequently up-regulated in acute myeloid leukemia, Pim1 may be a therapeutic target in human disease.","['Hu, Yu-Long', 'Passegue, Emmanuelle', 'Fong, Stephen', 'Largman, Corey', 'Lawrence, Hugh Jeffrey']","['Hu YL', 'Passegue E', 'Fong S', 'Largman C', 'Lawrence HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1885524,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 1;109(11):4732-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-08-043356.

Such vaccines culminate in tumor-specific T cell responses, implicating the role of adaptive immunity. We have developed a rapid and efficient procedure utilizing an isoelectric focusing technique to obtain vaccines from tumor or normal tissues called chaperone-rich cell lysate (CRCL). Tumor-associated peptides, the currency of T cell-mediated anticancer immunity, are believed to be purveyed by chaperone vaccines. Our purpose was to demonstrate our ability to manipulate the peptide antigen repertoire of CRCL vaccines as a novel anticancer strategy. Our methods allow us to prepare ""designer"" CRCL, utilizing the immunostimulation activity and the carrying capacity of CRCL to quantitatively acquire and deliver exogenous antigenic peptides (e.g., derived from the oncogenic BCR/ABL protein in chronic myelogenous leukemia). Using fluorescence-based and antigen-presentation assays, we determined that significant quantities of exogenously added peptide could accumulate in ""designer"" CRCL and could stimulate T cell activation. Further, we concluded that peptide-embedded CRCL, devoid of other antigens, could generate potent immunity against pre-established murine leukemia. Designer CRCL allows for the development of personalized vaccines against cancers expressing known antigens, by embedding antigens into CRCL derived from normal tissue.","['Kislin, Kerri L', 'Marron, Marilyn T', 'Li, Gang', 'Graner, Michael W', 'Katsanis, Emmanuel']","['Kislin KL', 'Marron MT', 'Li G', 'Graner MW', 'Katsanis E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/08/19 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2007 Jul;21(9):2173-84. doi: 10.1096/fj.06-7843com.

It has been argued that giving the aminoglycoside once daily to neutropenic patients with Gram-negative bacteraemia may be hazardous when penicillin G is the beta-lactam antibiotic. We questioned this argument and hypothesized that tobramycin once daily was as efficacious as three times daily. METHODS: We conducted a randomized prospective multicentre study, comparing the efficacy of tobramycin 6 mg/kg once (arm A) versus three times (arm B) daily, plus penicillin G 5 million IU x 4, in febrile neutropenic cancer patients. PRIMARY OUTCOME: modification of the antibiotic regimen. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-four patients were evaluable for intention-to-treat analyses. One hundred and fifty-five patients had lymphoma or leukaemia as the underlying cancer diagnosis. In arm A, 35 of 88 patients and in arm B, 34 of 86 patients, that is 40% in both arms had no modification of the antibiotic regimen. No patients died while participating in the study. Upon modification of the antibiotic regimen, all patients were successfully treated. The increase in serum creatinine was modest and similar in the two treatment groups.

We analyzed here how to improve the efficiency of LV transduction, which we performed at the initial stages of the differentiation of purified monocytes into dendritic cells (Mo-DCs). Using LVs pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus envelope G glycoprotein (VSV-G), we found that a conditioned medium derived from dying monocytes (MCM) improved by 2- to 10- fold the proportion of transduced Mo-DCs. This enhanced transduction efficiency requires the presence of MCM during the initial stage of LV transduction and does not affect the phenotype and antigen presentation function of terminally differentiated Mo-DCs. Importantly, we found that MCM derived from a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, was equally effective. The MCM activity was heat stable (56 degrees C) and was present in the soluble fraction after high-speed centrifugation. Altogether our results show that a soluble factor present in dying monocyte cultures can replace advantageously facilitating agents such as Polybrene, to achieve high LV transductions levels.

In this group, there were 6237 deaths, which is 14% fewer than the 7242 deaths expected based on general population rates. Numbers of observed versus expected deaths (shown hereafter as observed/expected) were 1608/1741 for all cancers combined, including 71/61 for leukemia, 53/53 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL*), and 26/27 for multiple myeloma. The higher than expected number of deaths from leukemia (16% increase) was concentrated in workers paid hourly who had started work 20 to 29 years earlier, had worked 10 or more years in the industry, and had worked in subgroups employed in polymerization, coagulation, maintenance labor, and laboratory operations. The overall higher leukemia mortality rate, as well as the higher rate in the subgroup of hourly workers who had 20 or more years since hire and 10 or more years worked, was not limited to a particular form of leukemia. Cumulative exposure to 1,3-butadiene (BD) was associated positively with all leukemias, with chronic myelogenous leukemia and, to a lesser extent, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Exposure to styrene or to dimethyldithiocarbamate (DMDTC) also was associated positively with leukemia. Exposures to these two agents were correlated with exposure to BD; data were limited on the independent effects of each of the three chemicals on leukemia. After controlling for the effects of BD, we found no consistent exposure-response relation between either styrene or DMDTC and all leukemias, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or CLL. However, a positive association between any exposure to DMDTC and leukemia persisted. The data from this study indicate that employment in the synthetic rubber industry is related causally to leukemia. Uncertainty remains about the specific agent or agents responsible for the association. The carcinogenic mechanisms through which BD, styrene, or DMDTC could cause leukemia in humans have not been established, and epidemiologic support for a leukemogenic role is limited for these agents. Styrene and DMDTC were associated positively with NHL. External support for this relation has not been reported from other epidemiologic studies. The study did not find any clear relation between exposure to BD, styrene, or DMDTC and multiple myeloma. Some subgroups of subjects had more than the expected number deaths from colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and other diseases. These increases did not appear to be related to occupational exposure in the industry.","['Delzell, Elizabeth', 'Sathiakumar, Nalini', 'Graff, John', 'Macaluso, Maurizio', 'Maldonado, George', 'Matthews, Robert']","['Delzell E', 'Sathiakumar N', 'Graff J', 'Macaluso M', 'Maldonado G', 'Matthews R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Res Rep Health Eff Inst,Research report (Health Effects Institute),8812230,,2007/03/01 09:00,2007/04/05 09:00,['2007/03/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/05 09:00 [medline]', '2007/03/01 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Res Rep Health Eff Inst. 2006 Aug;(132):1-63; discussion 65-74.,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Dimethyldithiocarbamate)', '0 (Elastomers)', '44LJ2U959V (Styrene)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Butadienes/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Dimethyldithiocarbamate/adverse effects/pharmacology', '*Elastomers', 'Humans', '*Industry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mortality/*trends', 'Neoplasms/etiology/mortality', 'North America', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Styrene/adverse effects/pharmacology']",,,"['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, 1665 University Blvd, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham AL 35294-0022, USA.']",,,,,,,,,['Health Effects Institute'],,,,,,,

To explore the function of COX-2 in liver, transgenic (Tg) mice were generated containing a fusion gene (LIVhCOX-2) consisting of human COX-2 cDNA under the control of the human ApoE promoter. Six lines were developed; all of them expressed the LIVhCOX-2 transgene selectively in hepatocytes. The Tg mice exhibited a normal phenotype, and the increased levels of PGE2 found were due to the constitutively expressed COX-2. Histological analysis of different tissues and macroscopic examination of the liver showed no differences between wild-type (Wt) and Tg animals. However, Tg animals were resistant to Fas-mediated liver injury, as demonstrated by low levels of plasmatic aminotransferases, a lesser caspase-3 activation, and Bax levels and an increase in Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and xIAP proteins, when compared with the Wt animals. Moreover, the resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis is suppressed in the presence of COX-2-selective inhibitors, which prevented prostaglandin accumulation in the liver of Tg mice. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that expression of COX-2-dependent prostaglandins exerted a protection against liver apoptosis.","['Casado, Marta', 'Molla, Belen', 'Roy, Rosa', 'Fernandez-Martinez, Amalia', 'Cucarella, Carme', 'Mayoral, Rafael', 'Bosca, Lisardo', 'Martin-Sanz, Paloma']","['Casado M', 'Molla B', 'Roy R', 'Fernandez-Martinez A', 'Cucarella C', 'Mayoral R', 'Bosca L', 'Martin-Sanz P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/03/27 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 2007 Mar;45(3):631-8. doi: 10.1002/hep.21556.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Fas protein, mouse)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 2.6.1.1 (Aspartate Aminotransferases)', 'EC 2.6.1.2 (Alanine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,,"['Alanine Transaminase/blood', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Aspartate Aminotransferases/blood', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Hepatocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Liver/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'fas Receptor/immunology/*physiology']",['10.1002/hep.21556 [doi]'],,"['Instituto de Biomedicina de Valencia, IBV-CSIC, Valencia, Spain. mcasado@ibv.csic.es']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic role of comorbidities in this population. METHODS: : For this single-center, retrospective study, the authors analyzed the outcome of 133 patients aged >/=70 years who received induction chemotherapy for nonpromyelocytic AML between 1995 and 2004. Comorbidities were evaluated by using an adapted form of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). RESULTS: : The median patient age was 73 years. The CCI score was 0 for 83 patients (68%), 1 for 16 patients (13%), and >1 for 23 patients (19%). The complete remission (CR) rate was 56%, and the median overall survival was 9 months. In multivariate analysis, 4 adverse prognostic factors for CR were identified: unfavorable karyotype, leukocytosis >/=30 g/L, CD34 expression on leukemic cells, and CCI >1. A score could be generated to allow the stratification of patients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with CR rates of 87%, 63%, and 37%, respectively. The risk of early mortality and the probability of survival also were different in the 3 risk groups (P = .02 and P = .01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: : The results from this study indicated that associated comorbidities are independent factors that may influence achievement of CR in elderly patients with AML. Such a scoring system may be useful in the prognostic staging systems that are used to identify patients with AML who can benefit from induction chemotherapy.","['Etienne, Anne', 'Esterni, Benjamin', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Coso, Diane', 'Puig, Brigitte', 'Gastaut, Jean-Albert', 'Maraninchi, Dominique', 'Vey, Norbert']","['Etienne A', 'Esterni B', 'Charbonnier A', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Arnoulet C', 'Coso D', 'Puig B', 'Gastaut JA', 'Maraninchi D', 'Vey N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):1376-83. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22537.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",['10.1002/cncr.22537 [doi]'],['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],"['Department of Hematology, Paoli-Calmettes Institute, Marseille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is an effective agent for the salvage of patients with recurrent APL, and gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) has shown activity in patients with APL. METHODS: The authors investigated the efficacy of a combination of ATO, ATRA, and GO in 8 patients with APL in first recurrence (7 patients with hematologic recurrences and 1 patient with a molecular recurrence). All patients had received previous treatment with ATRA either alone or in combination with other agents. Patients received ATO 0.15 mg/kg intravenously until they achieved a bone marrow complete remission (CR). Once in CR, patients received consolidation with ATO, ATRA, and GO for 10 months. Patients then received maintenance with idarubicin, ATRA, 6-marcaptopurine, and oral methotrexate for 11 months. RESULTS: All 7 patients who had hematologic recurrences achieved CR after a median of 39 days (range, 21-56 days). After a median follow-up of >/=36 months (range, 4-55 months), 6 patients remained alive in CR, and 2 patients died in CR. Six of 8 patients remained in second CR that was longer than their first CR. All 7 evaluable patients achieved molecular remission. There were no grade 3 or 4 extramedullary toxicities. Two patients died, 1 secondary to a complication of metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, and the other of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ATO, ATRA, and GO was effective and may achieve durable remissions in patients with APL in first recurrence. It should be considered as an effective alternative to allogeneic or autologous transplantation.","['Aribi, Ahmed', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Estey, Elihu H', 'Koller, Charles A', 'Thomas, Deborah A', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Faderl, Stefan H', 'Laddie, Nakia M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge E']","['Aribi A', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Estey EH', 'Koller CA', 'Thomas DA', 'Kornblau SM', 'Faderl SH', 'Laddie NM', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes JE']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):1355-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22524.,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/administration & dosage', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",['10.1002/cncr.22524 [doi]'],['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Thus, there is a need to establish new best practices for CML management in the post-imatinib era. METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire, consisting of 26 multiple choice questions, was developed to assess hematologists' and oncologists' self-reported treatment strategies for CML. RESULTS: Between November 2005 and January 2006, 956 eligible physicians responded to the survey; 727 from the US and 229 from Europe. Most US respondents (60%) practiced in the community setting, whereas European respondents were primarily academic (44%) and hospital-based (40%). Physicians' responses were generally in line with current recommendations, although differences were identified. Confusion existed among respondents over optimal timing of treatment decisions, with a notable proportion of physicians focusing on a single timepoint rather than consistent monitoring, as currently advocated. Some respondents were unaware of new molecular monitoring techniques, when to monitor for BCR-ABL mutations (and the impact on treatment decisions), and the benefit of new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Responses to the survey suggest that treatment practices in some areas of CML management are not in line with current recommendations. Identified areas of need should be targeted in future educational activities for the CML community.","['Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Guilhot, Franccois', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Lokey, Lee']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Cortes J', 'Guilhot F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Baccarani M', 'Lokey L']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2007 Apr 1;109(7):1365-75. doi: 10.1002/cncr.22523.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Benzamides', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Health Surveys', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', ""*Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",['10.1002/cncr.22523 [doi]'],['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Vitamin A and its two important metabolites, retinaldehyde and retinoic acids, are fat-soluble unsaturated isoprenoids necessary for growth, differentiation and maintenance of epithelial tissues, and also for reproduction. In a reversible process, vitamin A is oxidized IN VIVO to give retinaldehyde, which is important for vision. The dramatic effects of vitamin A analogues on embryogenesis have been studied by animal experiments; the clinical malformation pattern in humans is known. Retinoic acids are major oxidative metabolites of vitamin A and can substitute for it in vitamin A-deficient animals in growth promotion and epithelial differentiation. Natural vitamin A metabolites are vitamins, because vitamin A is not synthesized in the body and must be derived from carotenoids in the diet. On the other hand, retinoids are also hormones - with intracrine activity - because retinol is transformed in the cells into molecules that bind to and activate specific nuclear receptors, exhibit their function, and are subsequently inactivated. The mechanisms of action of natural vitamin A metabolites on human skin are based on the time- and dose-dependent influence of morphogenesis, epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation, epithelial and mesenchymal synthetic performance, immune modulation, stimulation of angiogenesis and inhibition of carcinogenesis. As drugs, vitamin A and its natural metabolites have been approved for the topical and systemic treatment of mild to moderate and severe, recalcitrant acne, photoaging and biologic skin aging, acute promyelocytic leukaemia and Kaposi's sarcoma. On the other hand, the critical importance of the skin for the human body's vitamin D endocrine system is documented by the fact that the skin is both the site of vitamin D (3)- and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (3) [1, 25(OH) (2)D (3)]-synthesis and a target organ for 1,25(OH) (2)D (3). 1,25(OH) (2)D (3) is not only essential for mineral homeostasis and bone integrity, but also for numerous further physiologic functions including regulation of growth and differentiation in a broad variety of normal and malignant tissues, including cells derived from prostate, breast and bone. In keratinocytes and other cell types, 1,25(OH) (2)D (3) regulates growth and differentiation. Consequently, vitamin D analogues have been introduced for the treatment of the hyperproliferative skin disease psoriasis. Other newly detected functions of vitamin D analogues include profound effects on the immune system as well as protection against cancer and other diseases, including autoimmune and infectious diseases, in various tissues. Current investigation of the biological effects of vitamin D analogues are likely to lead to new therapeutic applications that, besides cancer prevention, may include the prevention and treatment of infectious as well as of inflammatory skin diseases. This review summarizes existing knowledge on vitamins A and D, the major vitamin-hormones of the skin.","['Reichrath, J', 'Lehmann, B', 'Carlberg, C', 'Varani, J', 'Zouboulis, C C']","['Reichrath J', 'Lehmann B', 'Carlberg C', 'Varani J', 'Zouboulis CC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Horm Metab Res,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,0177722,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/05/12 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/12 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Horm Metab Res. 2007 Feb;39(2):71-84. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-958715.,"['0 (Hormones)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Retinoids)', '11103-57-4 (Vitamin A)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hormones/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Keratinocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/physiology', 'Retinoids/pharmacokinetics/physiology/toxicity', 'Skin/growth & development/immunology/metabolism', 'Skin Diseases/drug therapy', 'Vitamin A/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*physiology', 'Vitamin D/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*physiology/therapeutic use', 'Wound Healing/drug effects']",['10.1055/s-2007-958715 [doi]'],,"['Department of Dermatology, The Saarland University Hospital, Homburg, Germany.']",,,,143,,,,,,,,,,,,

TEM morphology using ultrastructural cytochemistry helped in definitive typing in one mixed lineage leukemia case, one AML-M5b, one AML-M6b and one microgranular variant of APML. Thus, ultrastructural studies may be useful in accurate diagnosis of biphenotypic leukemia and further classification of acute leukemias. Also, in cases with hypercellular marrow and with associated myelofibrosis, where the marrow aspirate gives low cell count, ultrastructural studies are a valuable aid to arriving at an accurate diagnosis.","['Chatterjee, Tathagata', 'Panigrahi, Inusha', 'Agrawal, Neerja', 'Naithani, Rahul', 'Mahapatra, Manoranjan', 'Pati, Hara Prasad', 'Wadhwa, Shashi', 'Saxena, Renu']","['Chatterjee T', 'Panigrahi I', 'Agrawal N', 'Naithani R', 'Mahapatra M', 'Pati HP', 'Wadhwa S', 'Saxena R']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematology. 2006 Jun;11(3):147-51. doi: 10.1080/10245330600774884.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Peroxidase/analysis', 'Prospective Studies']","['757784992 [pii]', '10.1080/10245330600774884 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently north east Iran, particularly the region of Mashhad, has been recognized as a new endemic region. ATLL is an aggressive T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder. Patients with ATLL have high plasma levels of VEGF that induce angiogenesis. Prognosis of ATLL remains poor because of immunosuppression and intrinsic resistance to chemotherapy. Important advances in the treatment of ATLL were reported with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha. We investigated the effect of AZT/IFN treatment on vascular endothelium growth factor (VEGF) plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load in ATLL patients from the region of Mashhad. We confirmed that AZT/IFN treatment induces a high response rate and prolonged survival with minimal side effects. We also confirmed that VEGF plasma levels and HTLV-I proviral load are higher in ATLL patients than in asymptomatic carriers. We finally showed that AZT/IFN treatment reduced both HTLV-I proviral load and importantly VEGF plasma levels, suggesting a potential antiangiogenic effect of this therapy. These results provide further evidence for the efficacy and the mechanism of action of AZT/IFN therapy for ATLL in a developing country.","['Kchour, Ghada', 'Makhoul, Nadine J', 'Mahmoudi, Mahmoud', 'Kooshyar, Mohamad-Mehdi', 'Shirdel, Abbas', 'Rastin, Maryam', 'Rafatpanah, Houshang', 'Tarhini, Mahdi', 'Zalloua, Pierre A', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Farid, Reza', 'Bazarbachi, Ali']","['Kchour G', 'Makhoul NJ', 'Mahmoudi M', 'Kooshyar MM', 'Shirdel A', 'Rastin M', 'Rafatpanah H', 'Tarhini M', 'Zalloua PA', 'Hermine O', 'Farid R', 'Bazarbachi A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Feb;48(2):330-6. doi: 10.1080/10428190601071717.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (VEGFA protein, human)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Infections/*drug therapy/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/*drug therapy/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proviruses/*isolation & purification', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/*blood', 'Viral Load', 'Zidovudine/*therapeutic use']","['770740115 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190601071717 [doi]']",,"['Immunology Research Centre, Bu-Ali Research institute, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

B cells from 36 B-CLL patients were incubated with or without fludarabine for 48 h. Apoptosis was determined by two assays: annexin V staining and DNA staining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used for detection of trisomy 12, 11q deletion, and 17p deletion. Bcl-2 and CD38 expressions were determined by flow cytometry. Five patients had 17p deletion, 6 had trisomy 12, and another 6 had 11q deletion. B-CLL cells with 17p deletion had significant resistance to apoptosis induced by fludarabine and a slight spontaneous resistance to apoptosis. Bcl-2 and CD38 were not associated with in vitro spontaneous and fludarabine-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, 17p deletion, which causes loss of p53 gene, is associated with resistance to fludarabine-induced apoptosis in vitro.

Median patient age was 51 years (range, 24 - 64). At the time of transplantation all patients were in second or higher chronic phase (CP). The median follow-up after allogeneic transplantation was 360 days (range, 24 - 1524). Cox regression analysis revealed that the quality of cytogenetic response was a prognostic factor for transplant-related mortality (p = 0.050), relapse incidence (p = 0.015), leukaemia-free survival (p = 0.002) and overall survival (p = 0.006).

The authors describe a distinct group of three AML patients with mediastinal MS and complex cytogenetics presenting at their centre over a 7-year period. Clinical features consistent with superior vena caval obstruction were noted at presentation in two of the three patients. Mediastinal mass was detected on routine chest radiography, and biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of MS. One patient relapsed after consolidation chemotherapy and died from progressive disease.

However, only a few of these are complete (CHR) and durable. Imatinib is synergistic with idarubicin and cytarabine. We administered imatinib 600 mg/day, cytarabine 10 mg/day subcutaneous, and idarubicin 12 mg/m2 intravenous every 14 days in 19 patients with CML in myeloid BP. Fourteen patients (74%) achieved a hematologic response: CHR in 9 (47%) (3 with complete and 1 with minor cytogenetic responses) and return to chronic phase (RTC) in 5 (26%). Median duration of response was 10 weeks (range, 2 - 89). Six patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation: 4 CHR, 1 chronic phase and 1 BP. Median survival was 5 months (range, 2 - 20 months).

Therefore, new therapeutic modalities are needed to advance the cure rate. Seliciclib (CYC202, R-roscovitine) is a purine analog developed as an inhibitor of CDK2/cyclin E CDK7/cyclin H and CDK9/cyclin T. Seliciclib has been shown to be active in B-cell neoplasms, such as mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and in multiple myeloma in vitro. The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activity of seliciclib in DLBCL. The anti-proliferative activity of seliciclib was tested in nine human DLBCL cell lines and six DLBCL primary cell cultures. The effects of seliciclib on the cell cycle and on apoptosis, as well as on transcription-related proteins were assessed. The cell viability of all DLBCL cell lines and primary cells was reduced by seliciclib treatment. The IC50 for the cell lines ranged from 13 - 36 microm. The effect of seliciclib was independent of the genetic aberrations characterizing the cell lines. After seliciclib exposure cells accumulated in G2/M or in G1 phase, with most of the cells showing signs of apoptosis.

It is known that CD5 is physically associated with the T-cell receptor and B-cell receptor (BCR), inhibiting the signaling triggered by both of them. CD5 is also characteristic of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) B cells, although its implication in the development of this lymphoproliferative disorder has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the effect of CD5 in apoptosis, cell viability and global protein tyrosine phosphorylation mediated by BCR in B cells from B-CLL patients. As opposed to tonsil B cells, we did not observe an increase in the apoptotic or viability signals induced by anti-immunoglobulin M or SAC/interleukin-2 when CD5 was dissociated from BCR in leukemic cells of the majority of patients. We also observed that CD5 did not regulate the BCR-induced phosphotyrosine pattern in B-CLL B cells. These findings suggest that CD5 does not inhibit properly the BCR-mediated signaling in leukemic cells. This defect in inhibiting the BCR might contribute to the enhanced survival of B-CLL B cells.","['Perez-Chacon, Gema', 'Vargas, Juan A', 'Jorda, Julia', 'Alvarez, Natalia', 'Martin-Donaire, Trinidad', 'Rosado, Silvia', 'Losada-Fernandez, Ignacio', 'Rebolleda, Nerea', 'Perez-Aciego, Paloma']","['Perez-Chacon G', 'Vargas JA', 'Jorda J', 'Alvarez N', 'Martin-Donaire T', 'Rosado S', 'Losada-Fernandez I', 'Rebolleda N', 'Perez-Aciego P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/04/21 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Jan;48(1):147-57. doi: 10.1080/10428190600989331.,"['0 (CD5 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'CD5 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palatine Tonsil/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction']","['769601837 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190600989331 [doi]']",,"['Fundacion LAIR, Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analysed bone marrow samples in 139 cases using a comprehensive antibody panel with five-color combinations. Sensitivity was estimated by quantification of leukemia-associated aberrant immunophenotype (LAIP)-positive cells for each LAIP in 18 normal bone marrow (BM) samples. The logarithmic difference (LD) in LAIP-positive cells between leukemic and normal BM amounted to a median of 3.32 (range 1.76 - 4.89). Skipping one color resulted in an increase of LAIP-positive normal bone marrow cells while percentages of LAIP-positive leukemic cells changed only marginally (median gain in LD = 0.54; maximum gain = 3.30). Because regenerating bone marrow has not been used as control data are most important to post-therapy checkpoints. In 32 patients with clinical follow-up, a LD higher than the median (3.25) at the follow-up checkpoint corresponded to a longer event-free survival.

Troxacitabine has shown promise in preclinical studies in a variety of malignancies; hence, the current study was conducted to evaluate the activity of troxacitabine in relapsed or refractory lymphoid malignancies. This was a phase II, open-label, multinational, multicenter study of patients with relapsed or refractory lymphoproliferative disorders or multiple myeloma. Thirty-four adults were enrolled in the study and received the study drug at either 5.4 mg/m2 (n = 16) or 4.3 mg/m2 (n = 18). The dose was decided in a phase I study, during which dose escalation was carried to reach a maximum tolerated dose with an acceptable toxicity profile. Two separate phase I studies were performed in Europe and the US. Troxacitabine was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 min daily for days 1 - 5 every 4 weeks. Treatment was continued to disease progression or until the subjects met criteria for withdrawal or unacceptable toxicities were evident as outlined in the protocol. Two patients had a partial response (PR) to treatment with troxacitabine to yield an overall response rate of 13%. There were no complete responses seen with the drug. Stable disease was achieved in 15 patients (44%). All patients had at least one treatment related adverse event, which led to six withdrawals from the study. Hematologic toxicity constituted the most common adverse events. Serious adverse effects were seen in 62% of patients. None of the 13 deaths were attributed directly to troxacitabine.

As in other tissues, apoptosis plays an important role within the hematopoietic system in removing aged and non-functional cells. It plays a particularly important role in regulating the cells of the immune system. The signals and molecules regulating apoptosis in these immune cells have been intensely investigated over the years, providing great insight into the mechanisms involved. In contrast, much less is known about the regulation and role of apoptosis in the cells that produce differentiated hematopoietic cells, namely the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). It is appreciated that HSCs are under tight regulatory control, as either excessive proliferation or apoptosis will result in too many or too few hematopoietic cells (for example, leukemia or anemia). Apoptosis thus plays an essential role in maintaining the appropriate balance of HSC and mature blood cells and in protecting the HSC pool for life-long hematopoiesis. This review summarizes the current knowledge concerning apoptosis and its role in the physiology of the hematopoietic system, especially within the HSC compartment.","['Orelio, Claudia', 'Dzierzak, Elaine']","['Orelio C', 'Dzierzak E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/04/21 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/21 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2007 Jan;48(1):16-24. doi: 10.1080/10428190601032529.,['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)'],IM,,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic System/embryology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism']","['769604326 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190601032529 [doi]']",,"['Sanquin Research, Department of Blood Cell Research, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['R01 DK51077/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is not clear if these events occur over the same time frame and if they occur to the same extent in different cells. We have therefore investigated the effects of such compounds in three cell lines of different origins using different assay incubation times and temperatures. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: FAAH activity and cellular uptake of anandamide was measured using anandamide, radio-labelled either in the ethanolamine or arachidonoyl part of the molecule. KEY RESULTS: The FAAH inhibitor URB597 inhibited the uptake of anandamide into C6 glioma, RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells and P19 embryonic carcinoma cells at incubation time 4 min. However, a time-dependent and temperature-sensitive residual uptake remained after URB597 treatment. The combination of progesterone and nystatin reduced the uptake, but also decreased the amount of anandamide retained by the wells. Genistein inhibited anandamide uptake in a manner that was not additive to that of URB597. However, genistein was a potent competitive inhibitor of FAAH (K(i) value 8 microM). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The reduction of anandamide uptake by genistein can be explained by its ability to inhibit FAAH with a potency which overlaps that for inhibition of tyrosine kinase. The FAAH- resistant but time-dependent uptake of anandamide is seen in all three cell lines studied and is thus presumably a generally occurring process.","['Thors, L', 'Alajakku, K', 'Fowler, C J']","['Thors L', 'Alajakku K', 'Fowler CJ']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,PMC2013877,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/06/30 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/30 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2007 Apr;150(7):951-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0707172.

We wanted to show the regulatory effect of ETV6/RUNX1 and its reversibility by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), as well as to identify potential ETV6/RUNX1-regulated genes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used luciferase assay to show the interaction of ETV6/RUNX1 protein, ETV6/RUNX1-regulated gene, and HDACi. To identify ETV6/RUNX1-regulated genes, we used expression profiling and HDACi in lymphoid cells. Next, using the flow cytometry and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we measured differentiation changes in gene and protein expression after HDACi treatment. RESULTS: Luciferase assay showed repression of granzyme B expression by ETV6/RUNX1 protein and the reversibility of this effect by HDACi. Proving this regulatory role of ETV6/RUNX1, we identified, using complex statistical analysis, 25 genes that are potentially regulated by ETV6/RUNX1 protein. In four selected genes with known role in the cell cycle regulation (JunD, ACK1, PDGFRB, and TCF4), we confirmed expression changes after HDACi by quantitative analysis. After HDACi treatment, ETV6/RUNX1-positive cells showed immunophenotype changes resembling differentiation process compared with other leukemic cells (BCR/ABL, ETV6/PDGFRB positive). Moreover, ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemic cells accumulated in G(1)-G(0) phase after HDACi whereas other B-lineage leukemic cell lines showed rather unspecific changes including induction of apoptosis and decreased proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Presented data support the hypothesis that HDACi affect ETV6/RUNX1-positive cells via direct interaction with ETV6/RUNX1 protein and that treatment with HDACi may release aberrant transcription activity caused by ETV6/RUNX1 chimeric transcription factor.","['Starkova, Julia', 'Madzo, Jozef', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Kalina, Tomas', 'Ford, Anthony', 'Zaliova, Marketa', 'Hrusak, Ondrej', 'Trka, Jan']","['Starkova J', 'Madzo J', 'Cario G', 'Kalina T', 'Ford A', 'Zaliova M', 'Hrusak O', 'Trka J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Mar 15;13(6):1726-35. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-2569.

It was found that the tolerance of PIBCA nanoparticles by cells could be improved up to 100-fold by coating their surface with polysaccharides and haemoglobin.,"['Chauvierre, Cedric', 'Leclerc, Liliane', 'Labarre, Denis', 'Appel, Martine', 'Marden, Michael C', 'Couvreur, Patrick', 'Vauthier, Christine']","['Chauvierre C', 'Leclerc L', 'Labarre D', 'Appel M', 'Marden MC', 'Couvreur P', 'Vauthier C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/07/20 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2006/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2007/01/10 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/20 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2007 Jun 29;338(1-2):327-32. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.01.034.

CD8+ T cell responses to BCR-ABL fusion peptides have been reported in normal subjects and CML patients but CD4+ T cell responses have been less well characterised. Here, the 23-mer e14a2 fusion peptide VHSATGFKQSSKALQRPVASDFE has been used to stimulate T cell responses. Most normal subjects and CML patients showed no proliferative responses to this peptide, with stimulation indices not significantly greater than 1.0. Following a second stimulation with the same peptide, small proliferative responses were obtained in normal subjects but not CML patients. These responses were not improved following a third stimulation with 23-mer peptide, nor by using mature autologous dendritic cells to present the peptide. Intracellular interferon-gamma production by CD4+ T cells was also not induced by the 23-mer e14a2 peptide. Hence, this e14a2 peptide does not stimulate CD4+ T cell proliferation in vitro in most normal subjects or CML patients.

Plerixafor was synthesised by Johnson Matthey (AnorMED) in collaboration with the Rega Institute of Leuven, Belgium. Plerixafor is in phase III clinical trials in stem cell transplantation among cancer patients. Plerixafor blocks CXCR4, which triggers the rapid movement of stem cells out of the bone marrow and into circulating blood. These cells can then be collected and used in stem cell transplant procedures. Plerixafor had been available for partnering in Europe. However, decisions concerning partnering arrangements were deferred by AnorMED until top-line clinical data became available (expected in 2007). In November 2006, Genzyme Corporation completed its acquisition of AnorMED. Genzyme intends to commercialise plerixafor in >50 countries throughout the world using its existing transplant business. Evotec OAI was selected by AnorMED to support it in the chemical development of plerixafor. Evotec OAI will use EVOdevelop, its integrated chemical and pharmaceutical development platform, to complete the full validation of the process to plerixafor, including process research and development, cGMP manufacturing and analytical work. Evotec OAI will also be responsible for producing the relevant Chemical Manufacturing Control (CMC) documentation for regulatory filings. Top line results from the phase III studies are expected in the second quarter of 2007 and, assuming these are successful, the marketing submissions are planned for the US in 2007 (launch in 2008), and for Canada and Europe in 2008. Plerixafor has orphan drug status for stem cell transplantation in cancer patients in the US and the EU. AnorMED (now Genzyme) decided to pursue a full Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in Europe for plerixafor in stem cell transplant. Previously, the company had been planning on filing a CMA (Conditional Marketing Authorisation) in this region. The change in strategy requires additional phase II trials in the five major EU markets. Multicentre phase II trials with plerixafor have begun in Canada and Germany in approximately 50 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and multiple myeloma (studies EU21 and C201). Enrolment has been completed in a US-based, multicentre, phase II trial (study 2105) of plerixafor plus G-CSF in patients with multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. This study is designed to optimise the administration schedule of this combination therapy regimen. Plerixafor has completed a phase II study (study 2104) in multiple myeloma and NHL patients in combination with chemotherapy. A US-based phase II pilot study (study 2108) with plerixafor as a single mobilising agent in multiple myeloma patients undergoing stem cell transplant is underway. Another US-based phase II pilot study (study 2106) is evaluating plerixafor in combination with the standard mobilisation regimen, G-CSF, in patients with Hodgkin's disease undergoing stem cell transplant. AnorMED completed a phase II study (study 2101) evaluating the potential of plerixafor in combination with G-CSF as a therapy for stem cell transplantation compared to G-CSF therapy alone. The study involved patients with multiple myeloma and patients with NHL. Results indicated that the combination regimen was significantly superior to G-CSF treatment alone in stem cell mobilisation. Further trials are planned for plerixafor, to expand its use in transplant and in other indications including one to investigate the potential of plerixafor to improve the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with leukaemia.

The haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has an influence on the course of the disease and the quality of life as any other curative method. The authors explore the quality of life in 12 adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing autologous progenitor stem cell transplantation at the Department of Clinical Haematology of the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine of Charles University Hospital in Hradec Kralove. METHODS AND RESULTS: The European Quality of Life Questionnaire EQ-5D was used in evaluating effects of the selected healthy and psychosocial aspects on the quality of life (age, sex, level of education, religion, smoking abuse, polymorbidity, marital status and lapse time from transplantation). The results show that quality of life significantly depends on the age, level of education, smoking abuse, religion and polymorbidity. Effects of other aspects on the quality of life were not revealed. CONCLUSIONS: The global quality of life in our adult patients with acute myeloid leukaemia undergoing autologous progenitor stem cell transplantation at the Department of Clinical Haematology of 2nd Department of Internal Medicine of Charles University Hospital in Hradec Kralove is on greatly good level (mean EQ-5D score was 75.1% and mean EQ-5D VAS was 67.5%).","['Slovacek, L', 'Slovakova, B', 'Jebavy, L']","['Slovacek L', 'Slovakova B', 'Jebavy L']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,,2007/02/28 09:00,2007/03/28 09:00,['2007/02/28 09:00'],"['2007/02/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/28 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/28 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2006;145(12):949-52; discussion 953-4.,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,,"['Katedra valecneho vnitrniho lekarstvi, Fakulta vojenskeho zdravotnictvi Univerzity obrany, Hradec Kralove. ladislav.slovacek@seznam.cz']",,Zdravotni a psychosocialni aspekty kvality zivota nemocnych s akutni myeloidni leukemii po autologni transplantaci perifernich kmenovych bunek.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients may also present changes in their serum concentrations of trace elements such as zinc and copper. The present study aimed to follow anthropometric parameters and serum levels of zinc and copper in a group of children under treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal study, at the Pediatric Section of Hospital das Clinicas, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil. METHODS: Forty-five children with acute lymphocytic leukemia were studied. Anthropometric parameters such as weight and height and the daily intakes and serum levels of copper and zinc were recorded at diagnosis and during the treatment. RESULTS: During the initial phase of the treatment, there was an increase in energy intake accompanied by weight gain. However, during the later phases of treatment there was a reduction in energy intake with accompanying weight loss. Decreased growth rate during treatment was more pronounced in children with high-risk acute lymphocytic leukemia, probably due to radiation therapy.

Sometimes the magnitude of this anti-leukemia effect exceeds that of high-dose anti-leukemia drugs and radiation and can result in leukemia cure. We analyzed leukemia relapse data after transplants for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in this context. These data support the notion of a strong GvL effect in CLL. However, as most of these data are from studies of allotransplants, it is uncertain whether GvL operates in settings where the anti-leukemia effector cells and target CLL cells are genetically identical except for leukemia-related mutations. It is also uncertain whether GvL is distinct from GvHD. These potential limitations have important implications on whether immune therapy of CLL will work in non-allotransplant settings.","['Ben-Bassat, I', 'Raanani, P', 'Gale, R P']","['Ben-Bassat I', 'Raanani P', 'Gale RP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2007/02/27 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/02/27 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Apr;39(8):441-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705619.

Leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 5 years in CR1 was 69% for 149 patients autografted and 68% for 144 patients allografted, whereas in CR2, LFS was 51% in 195 autoHSCT and 59% in 137 alloHSCT recipients, respectively. In the group of autoHSCT for CR1 (n=149), higher relapse incidence (RI) was associated with shorter time from diagnosis to transplant (<7.6 months); transplant-related mortality (TRM) was increased in older patients (>47 years), whereas for CR2, longer time from diagnosis to transplant (>18 months) was associated with increased LFS and decreased RI. In the alloHSCT group for CR1 (n=144), age (<33 years) was associated with increased LFS and decreased TRM and for CR2 (n=137), the use of mobilized peripheral blood stem cells was associated with decreased TRM. Female recipient, a female donor to male recipient and transplants performed before 1997 were associated with decreased RI. In conclusion, HSCT still appears to have a role in APL, especially for patients in CR2.","['Sanz, M A', 'Labopin, M', 'Gorin, N-C', 'de la Rubia, J', 'Arcese, W', 'Meloni, G', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Alessandrino, P', 'Carreras, E', 'Iriondo, A', 'Novitzky, N', 'Jacobs, P', 'Bandini, G', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Frassoni, F', 'Rocha, V']","['Sanz MA', 'Labopin M', 'Gorin NC', 'de la Rubia J', 'Arcese W', 'Meloni G', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Alessandrino P', 'Carreras E', 'Iriondo A', 'Novitzky N', 'Jacobs P', 'Bandini G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Frassoni F', 'Rocha V']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,2007/02/27 09:00,2007/09/15 09:00,['2007/02/27 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007 Apr;39(8):461-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1705620.

Here, gene expression was studied in the inducible human CD34+ acute myelogenous leukemia cell line KG1 using oligonucleotide arrays and suppression subtractive cloning. Using this approach, we identified Dlg7, the homolog of the Drosophila Dlg1 tumor suppressor gene, as downregulated at the early stages of KG1 differentiation. Similarly, Dlg7 was expressed in normal purified umbilical cord blood CD34+CD38- progenitors but not in the more committed CD34+CD38+ population. Dlg7 expression was not detected in differentiated cells obtained from hematopoietic colonies, nor was expression detected in purified T-cells, B-cells, and monocytes. When analyzed in different types of stem cells, Dlg7 expression was detected in purified human bone marrow-derived CD133+ progenitor cells, human mesenchymal stem cells, and mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Overexpression of Dlg7 in mouse ES cells increased their growth rate and reduced the number of EBs emerging upon differentiation. In addition, the EBs were significantly smaller, indicating an inhibition in differentiation. This inhibition was further supported by higher expression of Bmp4, Oct4, Rex1, and Nanog in EBs overexpressing Dlg7 and lower expression of Brachyury. Finally, the Dlg7 protein was detected in liver and colon carcinoma tumors but not in normal adjacent tissues, suggesting a role for the gene in carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results suggest that Dlg7 has a role in stem cell survival, in maintaining stem cell properties, and in carcinogenesis.

Cytopenia, fluid retention, and skin rash were major adverse events, along with elevation in creatine phosphokinase levels. With a follow-up of approximately 3.5 years, imatinib treatment led to 88.7% overall survival (OS) and 85.2% progression-free survival (PFS) rates for group I, and 79.8% OS and 76.6% PFS rates for group II; the rates were not significantly different despite a lower average imatinib dose in group II.

Success depends on a fludarabine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP)-mediated increase in the active intracellular metabolite of ara-C, ara-C 5'-triphosphate (ara-CTP). Therapy-resistant leukemia may exhibit ara-C resistance, the mechanisms of which might induce cross-resistance to fludarabine with reduced F-ara-ATP formation. The present study evaluated the effect of combining ara-C and fludarabine on ara-C-resistant leukemic cells in vitro. Two variant cell lines (R1 and R2) were 8-fold and 10-fold more ara-C resistant, respectively, than the parental HL-60 cells. Reduced deoxycytidine kinase activity was demonstrated in R1 and R2 cells, and R2 cells also showed an increase in cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II activity. Compared with HL-60 cells, R1 and R2 cells produced smaller amounts of ara-CTP. Both variants accumulated less F-ara-ATP than HL-60 cells and showed cross-resistance to fludarabine nucleoside (F-ara-A). R2 cells, however, accumulated much smaller amounts of F-ara-ATP and were more F-ara-A resistant than R1 cells. In HL-60 and R1 cells, F-ara-A pretreatment followed by ara-C incubation produced F-ara-ATP concentrations sufficient for augmenting ara-CTP production, thereby enhancing ara-C cytotoxicity. No potentiation was observed in R2 cells. Nucleotidase might preferentially degrade F-ara-A monophosphate over ara-C monophosphate, leading to reduced F-ara-ATP production and thereby compromising the F-ara-A-mediated potentiation of ara-C cytotoxicity in R2 cells. Thus, F-ara-A-mediated enhancement of ara-C cytotoxicity depended on F-ara-ATP accumulation in ara-C-resistant leukemic cells but ultimately was associated with the mechanism of ara-C resistance.","['Yamamoto, Shuji', 'Yamauchi, Takahiro', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Takemura, Haruyuki', 'Kishi, Shinji', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Urasaki, Yoshimasa', 'Iwasaki, Hiromichi', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Yamamoto S', 'Yamauchi T', 'Kawai Y', 'Takemura H', 'Kishi S', 'Yoshida A', 'Urasaki Y', 'Iwasaki H', 'Ueda T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,2007/02/27 09:00,2007/05/10 09:00,['2007/02/27 09:00'],"['2007/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/10 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2007 Feb;85(2):108-15. doi: 10.1532/IJH97.06177.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,,"['Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/agonists/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Vidarabine/agonists/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']","['V2K61556677L926N [pii]', '10.1532/IJH97.06177 [doi]']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The allylic alcohol portion comprising the C-3, C-4, and C-5 carbons is essential for this function. The suggestion has been made that this alcohol moiety is oxidized in mitochondria to a carbonyl moiety, with the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, there is no established precedent for the apoptotic performance of 3-ketoceramides thus presumed. In this work, we have synthesized three different types of short-chain 3-ketoceramides, that is, (2S,4E)-2-acetylamino-3-oxo-4-octadecen-1-ol (A), (2S,4E,6E)-2-acetylamino-3-oxo-4,6-octadecadien-1-ol (B), and (2S,4E)-2-acetylamino-1-methoxy-3-oxo-4-octadecene (C), and demonstrated that these 3-ketoceramides are capable of inducing effective apoptosis in human leukemia HL-60 cells. In particular, the two monoenoic compounds, A and C, are far more powerful than the corresponding alcoholic analogue, N-acetyl-D-erythro-sphingosine.

The mechanisms for the formation of these variant translocations are not fully characterized. Studies on the prognosis of these variant translocations revealed conflicting results. In addition, deletions in the derivative chromosome 9 are reportedly more frequent among variant translocation cases. We analyzed cytogenetic and FISH data from 22 CML patients with variant translocations tested at our laboratory. Deletions were observed in 6 of the 14 cases with FISH data available (43%), consistent with the literature and higher than in typical translocation cases (12-15%). Sequential changes of 9q deletions are possible and could be acquired as the disease progresses in addition to simultaneous formation of the Philadelphia chromosome with the deletion.

These effects are self-limiting, but chronic respiratory symptoms are frequently observed in swine confinement workers. The present study was aimed at investigating organic dust-induced activation of the monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Unstimulated THP-1 cells proliferate in suspension but cultivation for several days in medium with complete dust or 0.22-mu-filtered suspension, caused a subset of the THP-1 cells to adhere to the substratum. As assessed by transmission light- and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy, dust-stimulated adherent THP-1 cells adopted macrophage-like morphology and expressed vimentin. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 was expressed in all dust-activated adherent cells, but only in 1% of the unstimulated cells in suspension. Sialoadhesin, a macrophage marker, was detected in dust-stimulated adherent THP-1 cells but not in the parental monocytes. Serum factors were required for the dust-induced expression of sialoadhesin, but not for adhesion to substrate or expression of ICAM-1. In addition, morphology and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) of dust-stimulated adherent cells equalled that of PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells, but the PMA-differentiated cells exhibited weak sialoadhesin labelling. In conclusion, exposure to organic dust from a swine confinement building activated a subset of THP-1 monocytes inducing expression of intercellular adhesion molecules, which are important in inflammation. The sustained adhesion to substrate indicates that organic dust from a swine confinement building may contain agents that prevent deactivation and detachment of the cells.","['Burvall, Karin', 'Palmberg, Lena', 'Larsson, Kjell']","['Burvall K', 'Palmberg L', 'Larsson K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Life Sci,Life sciences,0375521,,2007/02/27 09:00,2007/05/02 09:00,['2007/02/27 09:00'],"['2006/08/28 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/01 00:00 [revised]', '2007/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/02 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Life Sci. 2007 Apr 3;80(17):1598-607. doi: 10.1016/j.lfs.2007.01.048.

We hypothesized that the presence of a chlorine molecule projecting into the DNA minor groove would affect DNA:protein-binding interactions. Here, we investigated recognition of and binding to double-stranded CldAMP-substituted TATA promoter sequences by human TATA-binding protein (TBP) using mobility shift assays. Depending on the site, CldAMP in place of dAMP within a TATA sequence decreased in vitro TBP binding by approximately 30% to 55% compared to control sites. When bound to a CldAMP-substituted TATA box, however, the TBP complex was more resistant to polyanions, suggesting enhanced stability. Limited exposure of the TBP:DNA complex to proteases indicated that TBP conformation was altered on CldAMP-substituted DNA compared to control. Further, binding of transcription factor IIB to TBP was diminished on analog-containing TATA sequences. These results suggest normal TBP-binding interactions--specifically recognition, stability, and conformation-are disrupted by CldAMP insertion into eukaryotic promoter sequences.","['Hartman, William R', 'Walters, D Eric', 'Hentosh, Patricia']","['Hartman WR', 'Walters DE', 'Hentosh P']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,,2007/02/27 09:00,2007/05/19 09:00,['2007/02/27 09:00'],"['2006/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/27 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 2007 Mar 15;459(2):223-32. doi: 10.1016/j.abb.2006.12.031.

Thirty-one subjects treated with anthracyclines (PA) and 11 subjects treated with different antitumour drugs (P0) were investigated twice (the interval between two investigations 1-9 years). Three hundred and thirty-nine healthy subjects served as controls (C). Systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressures (DBP) in the finger arteries and inter-beat interval (IBI) were recorded beat-to-beat (FINAPRES, Ohmeda, metronome controlled breathing, 5 minute recording); the values were corrected by auscultatory blood pressure measurements. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS, ms/mmHg) was determined by a spectral method. As the investigated subjects were of different ages, the measured values were standardised on the age of 16 years by linear regression, and only standardised values (IBI16, SBP16, DBP16 and BRS16) were further analysed. No differences were found between PA, P0 and C in BRS16 and IBI16. SBP16 and DBP16 were significantly lower in PA (102.1+/-8.3/59.7+/-7.1 versus C: 114.1+/-12.4/69.0+/-9.5 mmHg; p<0.001/p<0.001; mean from two investigations). SBP16 but not DBP16 was also lower in P0 (102.7+/-12.6/64.5+/-9.7 mmHg; p<0.01/no significant) than in C. The correlation coefficient between SBP16 and period after treatment in PA was -0.11 (no significant) and -0.06 in DBP16 (no significant). Thus, there is not seen a trend to normalisation.

These simian viruses present risks to both captive nonhuman primate populations and persons exposed to nonhuman primates. Simian retroviruses, including simian immunodeficiency virus, simian type D retrovirus, simian T-lymphotropic virus, and gibbon ape leukemia virus, have been shown to cause clinical disease in nonhuman primates. In contrast, simian foamy virus, a retrovirus that is highly prevalent in most nonhuman primates, has not been associated with clinical disease in naturally infected primates. Although it has been shown that human retrovirus infections with human T-lymphotropic virus and human immunodeficiency virus originated through multiple independent introductions of simian retroviruses into human populations that then spread globally, little is known about the frequency of such zoonotic events. In this article, exogenous simian retroviruses are reviewed as a concern for zoo and wildlife veterinarians, primate handlers, other persons in direct contact with nonhuman primates, and other nonhuman primates in a collection.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The total dose administered was 12 Gy at the reference point, 2 Gy/fraction, one fraction per day, 6 consecutive days, with a total dose of 8 - 11.4 Gy delivered to the lung, using Mevatron Primus linear accelerator (6 MV & 15 MV, 200-300 cGy/min in isocenter), in vivo dosimetry detectors and equipment for the reference dosimetry, personalized blocks for lung shielding sustained by polymethylmethaacrylate (PPMA) plate, Simulix HP simulator, and computer tomographic (CT) scans. Techniques used were: a) two parallel opposed anteroposterior / posteroanterior (AP/PA) fields with the patient in prone and supine position; b) two parallel opposed lateral fields with the patient placed on a lateral table, at 320 cm from the source. The percentage depth dose, tissue maximum ratio (TMR), off axis ratio (OAR) and the reference dose rate were measured for every patient's geometrical characteristics, with an uncertainty of +/- 2.2% and were used to calculate monitor units and to evaluate the dose in organs at risk (lungs, gonads, eyes etc). RESULTS: 5 patients (3 with the AP/PA technique and 2 with the lateral technique) were irradiated. All patients completed their irradiation in good clinical condition. The acute side effects were minimal (WHO grade 1: nausea/ vomiting--all patients; diarrhea--1 patient; headache--2 patients; photophobia and diplopia--1 patient; head and neck skin erythema--all patients). Because of the short follow-up period no safe evaluation of late side effects can be done. However, during this period one patient developed a non-aggressive form of chronic liver graft vs. host disease (GVHD) and one patient died due to acute GVHD. CONCLUSION: TBI as part of stem cell transplantation for hematological malignancies was successfully realized at our Institute, with favorable clinical results. This technique is easy to carry out and reproducible.","['Anghel, R', 'Matache, G', 'Vasile, M', 'Matache, R I', 'Oprea, L', 'Popa, R', 'Sucitu, A', 'Costandache, N', 'Barbulescu, I', 'Colita, D', 'Varady, Z', 'Tanase, A', 'Moicean, A', 'Arion, C', 'Colita, A', 'Dumitrache, L']","['Anghel R', 'Matache G', 'Vasile M', 'Matache RI', 'Oprea L', 'Popa R', 'Sucitu A', 'Costandache N', 'Barbulescu I', 'Colita D', 'Varady Z', 'Tanase A', 'Moicean A', 'Arion C', 'Colita A', 'Dumitrache L']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Cyprus,J BUON,Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology,100883428,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J BUON. 2006 Apr-Jun;11(2):167-74.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*methods']",,,"['University of Medicine and Pharmacy Carol Davila, Bucharest, Romania. ranghel@iob.ro']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated the effects of leptin upon apoptosis induced by serum depletion and on expression of the apoptotic regulators B-cell leukaemia 2 gene product (BCL-2) and BCL2-associated X protein (Bax) in the glucose-responsive BRIN-BD11 beta-cell line. METHODS: BRIN-BD11 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 and subsequently serum depleted +/- leptin (10 and 50 ng/mL) for 24 h. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using a modified MTS assay and TUNEL/YO-PRO-1 assays, respectively. BCL-2 and Bax expression were measured by real-time PCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: Leptin caused a reduction in serum-depleted apoptosis, although it failed to have any effect on the overall cell viability, causing a 68% shift from apoptosis to necrosis. Leptin significantly increased the level of BCL-2 mRNA expression (150% compared to serum depletion alone), without altering Bax mRNA expression. At the protein level, leptin increased BCL-2 and decreased Bax, altering the BCL-2 : Bax ratio. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that leptin reduces apoptosis in beta-cells at physiological concentrations, possibly via its ability to up-regulate BCL-2 and Bax expression.","['Brown, James E P', 'Dunmore, Simon J']","['Brown JE', 'Dunmore SJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Diabetes Metab Res Rev,Diabetes/metabolism research and reviews,100883450,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/11/14 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diabetes Metab Res Rev. 2007 Sep;23(6):497-502. doi: 10.1002/dmrr.726.,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Leptin)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Insulin-Secreting Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/*physiology', 'Leptin/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",['10.1002/dmrr.726 [doi]'],,"['Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders Research Group, RIHS, University of Wolverhampton, Wulfruna St, Wolverhampton, WV1 1SB, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The common primary sites for metastatic disease to the ovaries include the colon, stomach, breast, and the genitourinary tract. Hematologic malignancies, including lymphoma and leukemia, also involve the ovaries. Ovarian metastasis may occasionally represent the initial manifestation of disease, especially in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract. The accurate diagnosis of this condition is always crucial since the misinterpretation of such tumors may cause significant adverse consequences for patients. CT and MR features of secondary ovarian tumors differ according to the origins of the primary malignancies. The great majority of metastases from gastric cancer are Krukenberg tumors, which are typically bilateral and characterized by lobulated solid tumors. Metastases from colon cancer are usually cystic tumors with solid components of variable size. Metastases from appendiceal tumor may present as ruptured mucinous ovarian tumors associated with pseudomyxoma peritonei. Metastatic tumors from breast cancer are characterized by the relatively small size of the lesion. Ovarian involvement by hematologic malignancies is typically bilateral, homogeneous solid masses. Recognition of radiologic features of a variety of secondary ovarian tumors is beneficial for suspecting the secondary tumors under certain clinical conditions, and thus determining the appropriate management of the patients.","['Koyama, Takashi', 'Mikami, Yoshiki', 'Saga, Tsuneo', 'Tamai, Ken', 'Togashi, Kaori']","['Koyama T', 'Mikami Y', 'Saga T', 'Tamai K', 'Togashi K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Abdom Imaging,Abdominal imaging,9303672,,2007/02/24 09:00,2013/01/08 06:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2013/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Abdom Imaging. 2007 Nov;32(6):784-95. doi: 10.1007/s00261-007-9186-4.

We hypothesised that appropriate and timely adjustments in cell number occur because beta cells release proliferative signals to surrounding cells when stimulated by nutrients and 'bleed' these growth factors upon injury. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In rat pancreatic islets, we measured DNA content, insulin content, insulin secretion after treatment, immunoblots of apoptotic proteins and the uptake of nucleoside analogues to assess the ability of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is highly concentrated in beta cells, to act as a growth and survival factor. This focus is supported by work from others demonstrating that GABA increases cell proliferation in the developing nervous system, acts as a survival factor for differentiated neurons and, interestingly, protects plants under stress. RESULTS: Our results show that DNA, insulin content and insulin secretion are higher in freshly isolated islets treated with GABA or GABA B receptor agonists. Exposure to GABA upregulated the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia XL and limited activation of caspase 3 in islets. The cellular proliferation rate in GABA-treated islets was twice that of untreated controls. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: We conclude that GABA serves diverse purposes in the islet, meeting a number of functional criteria to act as an endogenous co-regulator of beta cell mass.","['Ligon, B', 'Yang, J', 'Morin, S B', 'Ruberti, M F', 'Steer, M L']","['Ligon B', 'Yang J', 'Morin SB', 'Ruberti MF', 'Steer ML']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Diabetologia,Diabetologia,0006777,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/11/08 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/11/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Diabetologia. 2007 Apr;50(4):764-73. doi: 10.1007/s00125-007-0601-8.

Although beta-catenin can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in Bcr-Abl-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that Bcr-Abl levels control the degree of beta-catenin protein stabilization by affecting its Y/S/T-phospho content in CML cells. Bcr-Abl physically interacts with beta-catenin, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate beta-catenin at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho beta-catenin binds to the TCF4 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl antagonist, impairs the beta-catenin/TCF-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated beta-catenin, which presents an increased binding affinity for the Axin/GSK3beta complex. Although Bcr-Abl does not affect GSK3beta autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on beta-catenin Y phosphorylation, Axin/GSK3beta binding to beta-catenin and its subsequent S/T phosphorylation. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib. These findings indicate the Bcr-Abl triggered Y phosphorylation of beta-catenin as a new mechanism responsible for its protein stabilization and nuclear signalling activation in CML.","['Coluccia, Addolorata Maria Luce', 'Vacca, Angelo', 'Dunach, Mireia', 'Mologni, Luca', 'Redaelli, Sara', 'Bustos, Victor H', 'Benati, Daniela', 'Pinna, Lorenzo A', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Coluccia AM', 'Vacca A', 'Dunach M', 'Mologni L', 'Redaelli S', 'Bustos VH', 'Benati D', 'Pinna LA', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,PMC1817619,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2007 Mar 7;26(5):1456-66. doi: 10.1038/sj.emboj.7601485.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 17 children, diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia and admitted to our department between February and December 2004. There were 11 boys and 6 girls, median age of this group was 4.2 years (range 0.5-12 years). Control group, consisted of 15 children (8 males and 7 females) age 2-13 (median age 4.8). RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in erythrocytes, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and total antioxidant status (TAS) levels were estimated using kits Randox Laboratories Ltd. Vitamin E and malonyldialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in plasma were measured fluorimetrically. Cytokine levels in plasma were assessed using Human Th1/Th2 Cytokine CBA kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). Two samples were taken from every patient: the first before therapy was started and the second after 5-6 weeks of therapy. The results were calculated and presented using Statistica 6.1 software. SOD and GPX activity in children with ALL was higher before and during treatment then in control subjects. However, differences were statistically significant only between GPX activity in children during treatment comparing to controls (p=0.03). MDA levels were higher in leukaemia group then in controls (p<0.05). IL-10 level was found to be higher in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: In children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, abnormalities in oxidative-antioxidative balance are observed. Lipid peroxidation is increased. GPX activity is higher during treatment.

When no donor is available, combined immunosuppressive therapy is given. AIM: Evaluation of results of immunosuppressive therapy in children with severe aplastic anaemia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: SAA was diagnosed in 85 children (31 girls, 54 boys) aged 2-17.5 years in the eleven centres of the Polish Paediatric Leukaemia and Lymphoma Study Group (PPLLSG) in Poland between 1993-2003 years. All patients received protocol of the Severe Aplastic Anaemia Working Party of the Europe Bone Marrow Transplant (EBMT): antilymphocyte globulin or antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporin A, prednisolone and granulocyto- or granulocyto-macrophagic-cell stimulation factor was additionally administered during deep neutropenia. Haematological response was evaluated on day 84, 112 or 180 of the therapy. RESULTS: complete remission occurred in 43 patients (50.5%), partial remission in 22 (25.4%), no response was obtained in 20 children (23.7%) in 180 day of the therapy. Period of observation was from 12 months to 10.5 years. During this time relapse occurred in 6 patients (7%). We observed 16 deaths: 7 early during the first 3 months of immunosuppressive therapy (IS) and 9 after the first 3 months of IS. CONCLUSION: the actual survival at 10-years, after immunosuppressive therapy is 81.2% in our group.

Early detection of adverse effects of anthracyclines is therefore very important for proper prevention of congestive heart failure. Current methods of detection of cardiotoxic activity of anthracyclines (ECG, ECHO) are suitable only for fully symptomatic cases. In subclinical damage of the heart these methods are insufficient. Measurement of NT-proBNP has been shown to be a sensitive indicator of cardiac abnormalities. Concentration of NT-proBNP in blood increases very early in response to volume overload of the ventricles of the heart seen in congestive heart failure. Chemical and physical features of NT-proBNP: long half-time in blood, low requirements for sample collection and storage conditions and easy availability of kits for its measurements make NT-proBNP a very good marker of subclinical postanthracycline congestive heart failure.","['Jackowska, Teresa', 'Wasilewski, Robert']","['Jackowska T', 'Wasilewski R']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2006 Jul-Sep;10(3 Pt 1):767-74.,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (pro-brain natriuretic peptide (1-76))', '114471-18-0 (Natriuretic Peptide, Brain)']",IM,,"['Anthracyclines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Cardiac Output, Low/blood/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Cardiomyopathies/blood/chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Child', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Electrocardiography', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Heart Failure/blood/*chemically induced/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Natriuretic Peptide, Brain/*blood', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Peptide Fragments/*blood']",,,"['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

THE AIM of the study was to analyze the initial symptoms, course and results of oncological therapy in children with stage IV of Hodgkin's disease. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The analyzed group comprised of 15 patients with IV stage HD (M/F: 11/4, mean age: 12 years), treated from January 1993 to March 2005, in two Polish centres of paediatric oncology in Gdansk and Lublin. The diagnosis and therapy were carried out according to the current protocols approved by the Polish Paediatric Leukaemia / Lymphoma Study Group (PPGBCh). RESULTS: Mean duration of initial symptoms was 4.5 months, with most children presenting general symptoms of HD. At diagnosis, the involvement of mediastinal and/or hilar lymph nodes was found in nine patients, lung infiltrations in six, involvement of the spleen, liver and bones in five, three and one patient, respectively. The nodular sclerosis histopathological type of HD predominated. Poor response to standard treatment was observed in five children. One patient received additional cycles of chemotherapy MVPP/B-DOPA, four children were administered the 2nd line chemotherapy Salvage 95. One boy with very poor response to the 1st and 2nd therapy lines additionally underwent megachemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cells transplantation. Radiotherapy was given to 13 children. 13 out of 15 children are alive and free of disease with mean follow-up duration of 6 years. In two of them late complications affecting hormonal status, cardio-pulmonary disorders and chronic B and C hepatitis were observed. Two children died including one admitted in a very severe condition, after long-lasting medical history who died of neutropenia-related sepsis. The second boy died 12 months after stem cell transplantation because of a second neoplasm--acute myeloblastic leukaemia. CONCLUSION: Chemo- and radiotherapy implemented according to protocols approved by the PPGBCh for children with stage IV HD, result in complete remission in most patients. Diagnosis made at earlier stages would result in giving less aggressive therapy, connected with a lower risk of durable late complications.","['Bien, Ewa', 'Stachowicz-Stencel, Teresa', 'Zawitkowska-Klaczynska, Joanna', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Odoj, Teresa', 'Polczynska, Katarzyna', 'Mitura-Lesiuk, Malgorzata', 'Stefanowicz, Joanna', 'Sierota, Danuta', 'Szolkiewicz, Anna', 'Birkholz, Dorota', 'Hennig, Marcin', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy R', 'Balcerska, Anna']","['Bien E', 'Stachowicz-Stencel T', 'Zawitkowska-Klaczynska J', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Odoj T', 'Polczynska K', 'Mitura-Lesiuk M', 'Stefanowicz J', 'Sierota D', 'Szolkiewicz A', 'Birkholz D', 'Hennig M', 'Kowalczyk JR', 'Balcerska A']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2006 Jul-Sep;10(3 Pt 1):631-8.,,IM,,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Poland', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Recurrence', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii, Onkologii i Endokrynologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: 42 children with HD were treated in the Department of Paediatrics, Haematology, Oncology and Endocrinology, Medical University of Gdansk, between 1994 and 2004. Stages of HD: II--26 children, III--10, IV--6; general symptoms (group B) were present in 50% of patients. Mediastinal involvement was found in 33 children, lung parenchyma infiltration in seven and bronchi involvement in one. In 1/3 of these patients the localization of HD within the chest was massive and symptomatic with signs of the superior caval vein symptoms, cough, dyspnea and cardiac tamponade. The treatment was conducted according to the schemes of the Polish Paediatric Leukaemia /Lymphoma Study Group. Eleven patients required therapy modification including six, in whom the intense line II chemotherapy Salvage 95 was introduced. 29 patients received chest irradiation with doses between J 75 and 36.5 Gy. Pulmonary function was evaluated from the results of clinical examination, 1 chest radiography (CXR), computed tomography, spirometry and lung scintigraphy. RESULTS: Pulmonary complications occurring as fatigue and diminished physical effort tolerance was observed in only two children. Some of the remaining 40 patients demonstrated asymptomatic abnormalities in the analysed tests. Abnormalities in CXR (upper mediastinal fibrosis, postoperational changes within the diaphragm and pneumonitis) were found in six children, minor ventilation problems in spirometry--in 12 and decreased lung perfusion in five. The scintigraphic signs of lung embolisation were not observed in our material. Most of the pulmonary complications occurred in children with enlarged lymph notes located within the chest, especially these with bulky disease presenting with cardio-pulmonary symptoms. In this group of patients the chest irradiation was performed in all except four children, three patients were also administered aggressive salvage chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The pulmonary complications in children after completed therapy of HD are not common and mainly asymptomatic and occur predominantly in patients with massive mediastinal and/or lung involvement at diagnosis. The issue needs further evaluation of a more numerous group of HD survivors and a longer follow-up.","['Stachowicz-Stencel, Teresa', 'Bien, Ewa', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Szolkiewicz, Anna', 'Kuziemski, Krzysztof', 'Lass, Piotr', 'Stefanowicz, Joanna', 'Sierota, Danuta', 'Polczynska, Katarzyna', 'Birkholz, Dorota', 'Hennig, Marcin', 'Balcerska, Anna']","['Stachowicz-Stencel T', 'Bien E', 'Adamkiewicz-Drozynska E', 'Szolkiewicz A', 'Kuziemski K', 'Lass P', 'Stefanowicz J', 'Sierota D', 'Polczynska K', 'Birkholz D', 'Hennig M', 'Balcerska A']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2006 Jul-Sep;10(3 Pt 1):613-21.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Male', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii, Onkologii i Endokrynologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

Imatinib was administered in daily dose 340 mg/m(2) (maximum 400 mg) and was continued for a period from 2.5 to 14.5 months until haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: Complete haematological remission was achieved in 5 out of 6 patients. Complete and major cytogenetic remission was achieved in 3 and 2 children, respectively. Molecular remission was achieved in 3 children with complete cytogenetic remission. One child with chronic myeloid leukaemia diagnosed at blast crisis demonstrated resistance to imatinib therapy. During imatinib therapy myalgia, ostealgia and mild myelosuppression were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Imatinib seems to be an efficient and well tolerated drug in children with chronic myeloid leukaemia.

Despite great progress in the treatment of childhood leukaemia, prognosis is still poor. This type of leukaemia must be distinguished from leukaemic reactions and transient myeloproliferative disorder. Transient myeloproliferative disorder is a rare condition in the neonatal period, connected with trisomy or other abnormalities of chromosome 21. It is characterized by high blastosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow and it usually resolves without specific therapy in 1 to 3 months. We present two cases: congenital leukaemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder. The first patient was a boy in whom congenital myelomonoblastic leukaemia (M4 in FAB classification) was diagnosed at age of 6 weeks. He was treated according to BFM-96 for acute myeloblasts leukaemia protocol, but there was no remission and he died of progressive congenital leukaemia after 4 months. The second patient was a female neonate with Down's syndrome and a cardiac defect (common atrioventricular canal) in whom hyperleukocytosis with blastosis in peripheral blood and bone marrow were detected at 2 days of age. Although no specific antileukaemic therapy was given her condition improved. At age of 3 months we observed normalisation of peripheral blood and at 5 months of age the bone marrow smear was normal. These cases confirm the difficulties in differentiation between congenital leukaemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder presented in literature. In spite of the same haematological symptoms the only difference may be detection of nonhematopoietic tissue infiltration (skin and central nervous system) commonly occurring in congenital leukaemia or the presence of trisomy and other abnormalities of chromosome 21 in transient myeloproliferative disorder.","['Jackowska, Teresa', 'Steczowicz, Monika', 'Pawelec, Katarzyna', 'Pacholska, Joanna']","['Jackowska T', 'Steczowicz M', 'Pawelec K', 'Pacholska J']",['pol'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Med Wieku Rozwoj,Medycyna wieku rozwojowego,100928610,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/05/04 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/04 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Wieku Rozwoj. 2006 Jul-Sep;10(3 Pt 1):595-601.,,IM,,"['Diagnosis, Differential', 'Down Syndrome/complications/diagnosis', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*congenital/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*congenital/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*congenital/*diagnosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,,"['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

Assignment to treatment strategy was by genetic randomization according to availability of a matched related donor. Evaluation followed the intention-to-treat principle. Six hundred and twenty one patients with chronic phase CML were stratified for eligibility for HSCT. Three hundred and fifty four patients (62% male; median age, 40 years; range, 11-59 years) were eligible and randomized. One hundred and thirty five patients (38%) had a matched related donor, of whom 123 (91%) received a transplant within a median of 10 months (range, 2-106 months) from diagnosis. Two hundred and nineteen patients (62%) had no related donor and received best available drug treatment. With an observation time up to 11.2 years (median, 8.9 years), survival was superior for patients with drug treatment (P = .049), superiority being most pronounced in low-risk patients (P = .032). The general recommendation of HSCT as first-line treatment option in chronic phase CML can no longer be maintained. It should be replaced by a trial with modern drug treatment first.","['Hehlmann, Rudiger', 'Berger, Ute', 'Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Heimpel, Hermann', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Hasford, Joerg', 'Kolb, Hans-Jochem', 'Lahaye, Tanja', 'Maywald, Ole', 'Reiter, Andreas', 'Hossfeld, Dieter K', 'Huber, Christoph', 'Loffler, Helmut', 'Pralle, Hans', 'Queisser, Wolfgang', 'Tobler, Andreas', 'Nerl, Christoph', 'Solenthaler, Max', 'Goebeler, Mariele E', 'Griesshammer, Martin', 'Fischer, Thomas', 'Kremers, Stephan', 'Eimermacher, Hartmut', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Hirschmann, Wolf-Dietrich', 'Lechner, Klaus', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Falge, Christiane', 'Kirchner, Hartmut H', 'Gratwohl, Alois']","['Hehlmann R', 'Berger U', 'Pfirrmann M', 'Heimpel H', 'Hochhaus A', 'Hasford J', 'Kolb HJ', 'Lahaye T', 'Maywald O', 'Reiter A', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Huber C', 'Loffler H', 'Pralle H', 'Queisser W', 'Tobler A', 'Nerl C', 'Solenthaler M', 'Goebeler ME', 'Griesshammer M', 'Fischer T', 'Kremers S', 'Eimermacher H', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Hirschmann WD', 'Lechner K', 'Wassmann B', 'Falge C', 'Kirchner HH', 'Gratwohl A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/07/03 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/03 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 1;109(11):4686-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055186.

Escalating imatinib doses may overcome resistance. Dasatinib, a significantly more potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL, is safe and effective in this population. Patients with imatinib-resistant chronic-phase (CP) CML were randomized 2:1 to 140 mg dasatinib (n=101) or 800 mg imatinib (n=49). With a median follow up of 15 months, complete hematologic responses were observed in 93% and 82% of patients receiving dasatinib and high-dose imatinib (P=.034), respectively. Dasatinib resulted in higher major cytogenetic response rates (52%) than high-dose imatinib (33%) (P=.023); this included complete cytogenetic response in 40% and 16% (P=.004).

Conditional stabilization of this molecule in pro-T cells promotes thymocyte development without the requirement for pre-TCR signaling. We show here that activated beta-catenin stalls the developmental transition from the double-positive (DP) to the single-positive (SP) thymocyte stage and predisposes DP thymocytes to transformation. beta-Catenin-induced thymic lymphomas have a leukemic arrest at the early DP stage. Lymphomagenesis requires Rag activity, which peaks at this developmental stage, as well as additional secondary genetic events. A consistent secondary event is the transcriptional up-regulation of c-Myc, whose activity is required for transformation because its conditional ablation abrogates lymphomagenesis. In contrast, the expression of Notch receptors as well as targets is reduced in DP thymocytes with stabilized beta-catenin and remains low in the lymphomas, indicating that Notch activation is not required or selected for in beta-catenin-induced lymphomas. Thus, beta-catenin activation may provide a mechanism for the induction of T-cell-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) that does not depend on Notch activation.","['Guo, Zhuyan', 'Dose, Marei', 'Kovalovsky, Damian', 'Chang, Rui', ""O'Neil, Jennifer"", 'Look, A Thomas', 'von Boehmer, Harald', 'Khazaie, Khashayarsha', 'Gounari, Fotini']","['Guo Z', 'Dose M', 'Kovalovsky D', 'Chang R', ""O'Neil J"", 'Look AT', 'von Boehmer H', 'Khazaie K', 'Gounari F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,PMC1890819,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/09/14 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/09/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 2007 Jun 15;109(12):5463-72. doi: 10.1182/blood-2006-11-059071.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multiple cancer cell lines were treated in vitro using AEE788 and HDAC inhibitors (LBH589, LAQ824, and trichostatin A), either alone or in combination. Effects on cytotoxicity were determined by growth and morphologic assays. Effects of the combination on cell signaling pathways were determined by Western blotting, and the results were confirmed using pathway-specific inhibitors and transfection of constitutively active proteins. RESULTS: Cell treatment with AEE788 and HDAC inhibitors (LBH589, LAQ824, and trichostatin A) in combination resulted in synergistic induction of apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (MV522, A549), ovarian cancer (SKOV-3), and leukemia (K562, Jurkat, and ML-1) cells and in OV202hp cisplatin-resistant human ovarian cancer cells. AEE788 alone or in combination with LBH589 inactivated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt cascades. Inhibition of either MAPK and/or Akt enhanced LBH589-induced apoptosis. In contrast, constitutively active MAPK or Akt attenuated LBH589 or LBH589 + AEE788-induced apoptosis. Increased apoptosis was correlated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine not only substantially suppressed the ROS accumulation but also blocked the induction of apoptosis mediated by cotreatment with AEE788 and LBH589. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results show that MAPK and Akt inactivation along with ROS generation contribute to the synergistic cytotoxicity of the combination of AEE788 and HDAC inhibitors in a variety of human cancer cell types. This combination regimen warrants further preclinical and possible clinical study for a broad spectrum of cancers.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Friday, Bret B', 'Lai, Jin-Ping', 'McCollum, Andrea', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Roberts, Lewis R', 'Adjei, Alex A']","['Yu C', 'Friday BB', 'Lai JP', 'McCollum A', 'Atadja P', 'Roberts LR', 'Adjei AA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/07/19 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2007 Feb 15;13(4):1140-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1751.,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'F9JLR95I3I (AEE 788)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Panobinostat', 'Purines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism']","['13/4/1140 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-06-1751 [doi]']",,"['Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A review of the literature was undertaken to summarize current information on the pathophysiology of CML and to update data of imatinib mesylate therapy, mechanisms of resistance, and in vitro and clinical data with the new tyrosine kinase inhibitors. RESULTS: Imatinib, which targets the ABL kinase activity of BCR-ABL, has prolonged survival in CML. Despite the efficacy of imatinib, some patients in chronic phase and more in advanced phases of CML develop resistance, frequently as a result of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase domain mutants that impair imatinib binding but retain enzymatic activity. New tyrosine kinase inhibitors inhibit BCR-ABL more potently than imatinib and maintain activity against an array of imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL mutants. The IC(50) values of nilotinib and dasatinib are at least 10- to 100-fold lower for BCR-ABL compared with imatinib. Phase I-II trials of nilotinib and dasatinib showed high activity in imatinib-resistant CML and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. Dasatinib also inhibits members of the Src family of kinases (SFKs); nilotinib does not. Whether SFKs have a critical role in imatinib resistance or BCR-ABL-mediated oncogenesis is unresolved. Agents that target signals downstream of BCR-ABL (e.g. Ras/Raf and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) are under investigation.

However, we can gain some insight into how this can be done by looking back over the 50-year history of taming acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL). APL is the M3 type of acute myeloid leukaemia characterized by an accumulation of abnormal promyelocytes in bone marrow, a severe bleeding tendency and the presence of the chromosomal translocation t(15;17) or variants. APL was considered the most fatal type of acute leukaemia five decades ago and the treatment of APL was a nightmare for physicians. Great efforts have been made by scientists worldwide to conquer this disease. The first use of chemotherapy (CT) was unsuccessful due to lack of supportive care and cytotoxic-agent-related exacerbated coagulopathy. The first breakthrough came from the use of anthracyclines which improved the complete remission (CR) rate, though the 5-year overall survival could only be attained in a small proportion of patients. A rational and intriguing hypothesis, to induce differentiation of APL cells rather than killing them, was raised in the 1970s. Laudably, the use of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in treating APL resulted in terminal differentiation of APL cells and a 90-95% CR rate of patients, turning differentiation therapy in cancer treatment from hypothesis to practice. The combination of ATRA with CT further improved the 5-year overall survival. When arsenic trioxide (ATO) was used to treat relapsed APL not only the patients but also the ancient drug were revived. ATO exerts dose-dependent dual effects on APL cells: at low concentration, ATO induces partial differentiation, while at relatively high concentration, it triggers apoptosis. Of note, both ATRA and ATO trigger catabolism of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein which is the key player in APL leukaemogenesis generated from t(15;17), targeting the RARalpha (retinoic acid receptor alpha) or promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) moieties, respectively. Hence, in treating APL both ATRA and ATO represent paradigms for molecularly targeted therapy. At molecular level, ATRA and ATO synergistically modulate multiple downstream pathways/cascades. Strikingly, a clearance of PML-RARalpha transcript in an earlier and more thorough manner, and a higher quality remission and survival in newly diagnosed APL are achieved when ATRA is combined with ATO, as compared to either monotherapy, making APL a curable disease. Thus, the story of APL can serve as a model for the development of curative approaches for disease; it suggests that molecularly synergistic targeted therapies are powerful tools in cancer, and dissection of disease pathogenesis or anatomy of the cancer genome is critical in developing molecular target-based therapies.","['Zhou, Guang-Biao', 'Zhang, Ji', 'Wang, Zhen-Yi', 'Chen, Sai-Juan', 'Chen, Zhu']","['Zhou GB', 'Zhang J', 'Wang ZY', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The affect of fibrosis on outcomes after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with MDS has not been examined. We performed a retrospective analysis in 471 patients with MDS or acute myeloid leukemia with multilineage dysplasia arising from MDS, 113 with and 358 without marrow fibrosis, who received myeloablative allogeneic HCT. Post-HCT follow-up was 0.3-10 years (median, 3.6 years) for patients with, and 0.6-12 years (median, 5 years) for patients without fibrosis. Engraftment was significantly delayed in patients with fibrosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.4; P < .001). Overall, there were no significant differences in overall survival (OS), relapse-free survival (RFS), and nonrelapse mortality (NRM) between patients with and without fibrosis. However, among patients with advanced disease (int-2 or high-risk disease by the International Prognostic Scoring System), OS (P = .03), RFS (P = .04), and NRM (P = .04) were inferior when marrow fibrosis was present. Given that marrow fibrosis is a poor prognostic factor for patients with MDS, and that it does not appear to affect outcome of transplantation in patients with earlier-stage disease but has a negative impact on outcome for patients with advanced disease, patients with earlier-stage MDS and marrow fibrosis might be considered for HCT earlier than their disease stage would normally dictate.","['Scott, Bart L', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Greene, Joanne E', 'Hackman, Robert C', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Scott BL', 'Storer BE', 'Greene JE', 'Hackman RC', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Deeg HJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Mar;13(3):345-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.10.030.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Decision Making', 'Delayed Graft Function', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']","['S1083-8791(06)00751-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.10.030 [doi]']",,"['Department of Clinical Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. bscott@fhcrc.org <bscott@fhcrc.org>']","['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL084054/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL82941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect depended on leukemia cell type. HLA-C mismatch reduced the relapse rate in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.47; P = .003), and HLA-DPB1 mismatch reduced it in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) (HR = 0.35; P < .001). In contrast, KIR2DL ligand mismatch in the graft-versus-host (GVH) direction (KIR-L-MM-G) increased in ALL (HR = 2.55; P = .017). An increased rejection rate was observed in KIR2DL ligand mismatch in the host-versus-graft direction (HR = 4.39; P = .012). Acute GVH disease (GVHD) was increased not only in the mismatch of HLA-A, -B, -C, and -DPB1, but also in KIR-L-MM-G. As a whole, the mismatch of HLA-A, -B, and -DQB1 locus and KIR-L-MM-G resulted in increased mortality. In conclusion, not only the mismatch of HLA-C and -DPB1, but also KIR-L-MM-G affected leukemia relapse, which should be considered based on leukemia cell type. Furthermore, KIR-L-MM induced adverse effects on acute GVHD (aGVHD) and rejection, and brought no survival benefits to patients with T-cell-replete UR-BMT.","['Morishima, Yasuo', 'Yabe, Toshio', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Kashiwase, Koichi', 'Inoko, Hidetoshi', 'Saji, Hiroh', 'Yamamoto, Ken', 'Maruya, Etsuko', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Sao, Hiroshi', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Kato, Shunichi', 'Juji, Takeo', 'Sasazuki, Takehiko', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa']","['Morishima Y', 'Yabe T', 'Matsuo K', 'Kashiwase K', 'Inoko H', 'Saji H', 'Yamamoto K', 'Maruya E', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Onizuka M', 'Sakamaki H', 'Sao H', 'Ogawa S', 'Kato S', 'Juji T', 'Sasazuki T', 'Kodera Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/06/15 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2006/10/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/15 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2007 Mar;13(3):315-28. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.10.027.,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (HLA-C Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'HLA-DP Antigens', 'Histocompatibility/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Receptors, KIR', 'Tissue Donors', 'Treatment Outcome']","['S1083-8791(06)00749-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2006.10.027 [doi]']",,"['Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Department of Hematology and Cell Therapy, Nagoya, Japan. ymorisim@aichi-cc.jp <ymorisim@aichi-cc.jp>']",,,,,,,,,['Japan Marrow Donor Program'],,,,,,,

Inhibition of gamma-secretase led to decreased Notch signaling, measured by endogenous NOTCH intracellular domain (NICD) formation, and was associated with decreased cell viability. Flow cytometry revealed that decreased cell viability resulted from a G(0)/G(1) cell cycle block, which correlated strongly to the induction of apoptosis. These effects associated with inhibitor treatment were rescued by exogenous expression of NICD and were not mirrored when a markedly less active enantiomer was used, demonstrating the gamma-secretase dependency and specificity of these responses. Together, these data strengthen the rationale for using gamma-secretase inhibitors therapeutically and suggest that programmed cell death may contribute to reduction of tumor burden in the clinic.","['Lewis, Huw D', 'Leveridge, Matthew', 'Strack, Peter R', 'Haldon, Christine D', ""O'neil, Jennifer"", 'Kim, Hellen', 'Madin, Andrew', 'Hannam, Joanne C', 'Look, A Thomas', 'Kohl, Nancy', 'Draetta, Giulio', 'Harrison, Timothy', 'Kerby, Julie A', 'Shearman, Mark S', 'Beher, Dirk']","['Lewis HD', 'Leveridge M', 'Strack PR', 'Haldon CD', ""O'neil J"", 'Kim H', 'Madin A', 'Hannam JC', 'Look AT', 'Kohl N', 'Draetta G', 'Harrison T', 'Kerby JA', 'Shearman MS', 'Beher D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Biol,Chemistry & biology,9500160,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/04/25 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/08/08 00:00 [received]', '2006/12/12 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/25 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol. 2007 Feb;14(2):209-19. doi: 10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.12.010.,"['0 (Cyclic S-Oxides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MRK 003)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)']",IM,,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic S-Oxides/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiadiazoles/pharmacology']","['S1074-5521(07)00034-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.chembiol.2006.12.010 [doi]']",,"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience, Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories, Terlings Park, Harlow, Essex, UK. huw.lewis.1991@pem.cam.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a natural product emitted by plants and endogenously produced by humans and other mammals. Therefore, exposure to isoprene from both endogenous and exogenous sources is unavoidable and occurs during the entire human life. Based on evaluations of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), isoprene has been classified in Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans). In the present work, we have demonstrated, by use of the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE or comet assay), that isoprene is able to induce DNA damage in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in the presence of metabolic activation. In addition, treatment of cells with the main isoprene mono-epoxide (EPOX I) induced time- and dose- dependent DNA damage in both PBMCs and human leukaemia cells (HL60). The metabolic activation system, represented by rat liver post-mitochondrial fractions (S9), was obtained from rats that had been treated - or not - with inducing agents such as phenobarbital and ethanol. The inclusion of S9 fractions (4mg protein/mL) from non-induced or phenobarbital-induced rats resulted in a statistically significant enhancement of isoprene genotoxicity. A different pattern was obtained by the addition of ethanol-induced S9, which appeared highly genotoxic by itself even in the absence of isoprene. Reducing the concentration of ethanol-induced S9 to 0.25mg protein/mL resulted in a considerable enhancement of isoprene genotoxicity. In the absence of clear epidemiological evidence of the carcinogenicity of isoprene in humans, the results of this study seem to be particularly important since they add new findings to support the classification of this chemical as possibly carcinogenic to humans.","['Fabiani, Roberto', 'Rosignoli, Patrizia', 'De Bartolomeo, Angelo', 'Fuccelli, Raffaela', 'Morozzi, Guido']","['Fabiani R', 'Rosignoli P', 'De Bartolomeo A', 'Fuccelli R', 'Morozzi G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/05/11 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2006/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2006/11/16 00:00 [revised]', '2006/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/05/11 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2007 Apr 20;629(1):7-13. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2006.12.007.

The patch-clamp method was employed to examine the effect of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD), a synthetic cholesterol-sequestering agent, on stretch-activated single currents. We found that cholesterol-depleting treatment with MbetaCD resulted in a suppression of the activity of mechanosensitive channels without a change in the unitary conductance. The probability that the channel was open significantly decreased after treatment with MbetaCD. Fluorescent microscopy revealed F-actin reorganization, possibly involving actin assembly, after incubation of the cells with MbetaCD. We suggest that suppression of mechanosensitive channel activation in cholesterol-depleted leukaemia cells is due to F-actin rearrangement, presumably induced by lipid raft destruction. Our observations are consistent with the notion that stretch-activated cation channels in eukaryotic cells are regulated by the membrane-cytoskeleton complex rather than by tension developed purely in the lipid bilayer.","['Morachevskaya, Elena', 'Sudarikova, Anastasiya', 'Negulyaev, Yuri']","['Morachevskaya E', 'Sudarikova A', 'Negulyaev Y']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Biol Int,Cell biology international,9307129,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/06/08 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/06/08 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Biol Int. 2007 Apr;31(4):374-81. doi: 10.1016/j.cellbi.2007.01.024.

Having shown by transcriptome analysis that the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells routinely used to maintain pluripotent embryonic stem cells express transcripts of the WNT/BMP families of signaling factors, we have assessed the effects on proliferation and differentiation of CD133+ cells of medium conditioned (CM) by MEF, by NIH3T3, and by NIH3T3 cells stably expressing WNT1, WNT3a, WNT4, WNT5a, and WNT11. Cultivation of CD133+ cells in MEF-CM led to a significant increase in cell number after 7 days of culture, while WNT-1, WNT3a-, and WNT11-CM increased the cell number significantly by 14 days of culture. During this period, WNT3a-CM increased the proportion of nestin-expressing cells and increased the ratio of blast-like cells to macrophages, suggesting that these signaling molecules contribute to the maintenance of an undifferentiated, blast-like phenotype. The number of cells expressing the endothelial-related marker CD31+ was significantly increased following culture in WNT5a- and WNT11-CM, whereas the number of cells positive for von Willebrand (vW) factor was maintained during 14 days of culture only in the presence of WNT4-CM. In addition, WNT5a-CM led to increased beta-catenin mRNA levels and the presence of beta-catenin protein in the cytoplasm and nucleus, consistent with the activation of the WNT signaling pathway. We conclude that in vitro conditioning of CD133+ cells by media containing specific WNT signaling factors influences the non-hematopoietic potential of CD133+ cells and dynamically alters the expression of the neural stem/progenitor cell marker nestin and the endothelial-related cell surface markers CD31 and vW factor.","['Nikolova, Teodora', 'Wu, Minyao', 'Brumbarov, Krassimir', 'Alt, Rudiger', 'Opitz, Heike', 'Boheler, Kenneth R', 'Cross, Michael', 'Wobus, Anna M']","['Nikolova T', 'Wu M', 'Brumbarov K', 'Alt R', 'Opitz H', 'Boheler KR', 'Cross M', 'Wobus AM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/04/27 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/27 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2007 Feb;75(2):100-11. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00119.x.,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Intermediate Filament Proteins)', '0 (NES protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nes protein, mouse)', '0 (Nestin)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Prom1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)']",IM,,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/*pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian/cytology/metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Intermediate Filament Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Nestin', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Wnt Proteins/*physiology', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']","['S0301-4681(09)60106-7 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.2006.00119.x [doi]']",,"['In Vitro Differentiation Group, Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics (IPK), Gatersleben, Germany.']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Four hundred and nine children were followed up using two largely independent sources. We compared survival using the Cox model. RESULTS: Maori and Pacific Island children had the same survival as non-Maori/non-Pacific children for 'all cancers combined' (hazard ratios (HR): 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.64-1.50 and 1.01; 95% CI: 0.53-1.89 respectively) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (HR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.45-2.62 and 0.99; 95% CI: 0.24-4.16, respectively). The ethnicity data stored within the National Health Index and the New Zealand Cancer Registry showed reasonably close agreement with ethnicity data provided by the children's mothers at interview (Kappa statistics: 0.82 and 0.81 respectively) while the Mortality Collection showed only moderate agreement (Kappa statistic: 0.63). CONCLUSION: The point estimates in this study provide no evidence of ethnic disparities in survival from childhood cancer in New Zealand. However, even in this national study there were small numbers of Maori and Pacific children leading to wide confidence intervals. We therefore recommend cautious interpretation.","['Douglas, Nicholas M', 'Dockerty, John D']","['Douglas NM', 'Dockerty JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,J Paediatr Child Health,Journal of paediatrics and child health,9005421,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/04/17 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/04/17 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Paediatr Child Health. 2007 Mar;43(3):173-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1754.2007.01038.x.,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Ethnicity', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Neoplasms', 'New Zealand', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Survival']","['JPC1038 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1440-1754.2007.01038.x [doi]']",,"['Department of Preventive and Social Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, blood samples were obtained from two captive margays (Leopardus wiedii). Samples were tested for antibodies to feline immunodeficiency virus, Dirofilaria immitis, feline panleukopenia virus, feline herpesvirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, and Toxoplasma gondii and for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) antigen. Fifty percent or more of the cats sampled were seropositive for feline herpesvirus (22 of 30), feline panleukopenia (15 of 30), and T. gondii (16 of 30). Five cats were positive for FeLV antigen. Both margays were seropositive for feline coronavirus and one was strongly seropositive to T. gondii. All animals were seronegative for D. immitis.

An unusually high incidence of lymphoid neoplasia occurred in a collection of Egyptian spiny-tailed lizards (Uromastyx aegyptius) from 1993-2001. Eight of 15 lizards necropsied at the Louisville Zoological Garden (53%) had multicentric lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry was not useful in characterizing the lineage of normal or neoplastic lymphocytes. By light and electron microscopy (EM), the neoplasms had plasmacytoid morphologic features suggesting B-cell origin, although some tumors also had a primitive lymphoblast component. A concurrent leukemic blood profile was identified in seven of the cases (88%). All were adult animals and no sex predilection was observed. No exposure to exogenous carcinogens was observed. Some of the lizards were unrelated, so hereditary factors were unlikely. Although examination by EM and viral isolation performed on archived tissues and plasma failed to detect viruses, an infectious etiology still warrants consideration.","['Gyimesi, Zoltan S', 'Garner, Michael M', 'Burns, Roy B 3rd', 'Nichols, Donald K', 'Brannian, Roger E', 'Raymond, James T', 'Poonacha, Kockanda B', 'Kennedy, Melissa', 'Wojcieszyn, John W', 'Nordhausen, Robert']","['Gyimesi ZS', 'Garner MM', 'Burns RB 3rd', 'Nichols DK', 'Brannian RE', 'Raymond JT', 'Poonacha KB', 'Kennedy M', 'Wojcieszyn JW', 'Nordhausen R']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Zoo Wildl Med,Journal of zoo and wildlife medicine : official publication of the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians,8915208,,2007/02/24 09:00,2007/03/14 09:00,['2007/02/24 09:00'],"['2007/02/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2007/03/14 09:00 [medline]', '2007/02/24 09:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Zoo Wildl Med. 2005 Mar;36(1):103-10. doi: 10.1638/03-122.,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Zoo', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/pathology', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', '*Lizards', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/epidemiology/pathology/*veterinary', 'Male']",['10.1638/03-122 [doi]'],,"['Louisville Zoological Garden, 1100 Trevilian Way, Louisville, Kentucky 40213, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDACs are present in eukaryotic and bacteria cells, and are fundamental for a number of cellular functions, including correct gene expression. Surprisingly, only up to 20% of the whole genome is controlled by HDACs, but key processes for survival, proliferation, and differentiation have been strictly linked to HDAC enzyme functioning. The use of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) has been proposed for the treatment of neoplastic diseases. Their effectiveness has been suggested for a number of liquid and solid tumors, particularly acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The role of HDACs in embryo development is currently under investigation. Published data indicate knockout phenotype analysis to be of particular interest, in which a number of HDACs play a key role during development. Little data have been published on the effects of HDACi on embryonic development, although for valproic acid (VPA), literature from the 1980s described its teratogenic effects in experimental animals and humans. To date, all tested HDACi have shown teratogenic effects similar to those described for VPA when tested in zebrafish, Xenopus laevis, and mice. HDACs were also able to alter embryo development in invertebrates and plants. A model, similar to that proposed in APL, involving retinoic acid receptors (RAR) and tissue specific Hox gene expression, is suggested to explain the HDAC effects on embryo development.","['Menegola, Elena', 'Di Renzo, Francesca', 'Broccia, Maria Luisa', 'Giavini, Erminio']","['Menegola E', 'Di Renzo F', 'Broccia ML', 'Giavini E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Birth Defects Res C Embryo Today,"Birth defects research.
