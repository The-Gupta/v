Beyond 50% of bone marrow plasmablasts, the plasmablastic myeloma represented a more aggressive phase in the course of the disease. In 2 patients this transformation was manifested by the development of extramedullary lesions. The possibility of chemotherapy influencing the progression of the plasmablastic clone by destroying the initial plasmacytic clone cannot be ruled out.

The effect of heat delivery rate and thermotolerance on the expression of heat shock proteins (hsp) by the human HL-60 cell line before and after differentiation was studied. This leukemia cell synthesized multiple hsp in response to elevated temperatures. The most obvious and consistent proteins were within the highly conserved stress-inducible family of polypeptides hsp70 which resolved as a hsp69/72 doublet. Cells which were made thermotolerant by gradual heating selectively failed to express the hsp70 doublet even though other hsp were synthesized. Mature HL-60 cells induced to differentiate by incubation in retinoic acid expressed a full complement of hsp when exposed to immediate heat, but there was selective deletion of hsp70 with gradual hyperthermia. This model for selective induction of hsp confirms that synthesis of hsp and thermotolerance can be dissociated in the HL-60. It suggests that the hsp70 does not play an obligatory role in thermotolerance of this human leukemia cell.","['Burns, C P', 'Wagner, B A', 'North, J A']","['Burns CP', 'Wagner BA', 'North JA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother,Medical oncology and tumor pharmacotherapy,8405039,['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)'],IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Oncol Tumor Pharmacother. 1989;6(4):245-53. doi: 10.1007/BF02985156.,0736-0118 (Print) 0736-0118 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02985156 [doi]'],"['CA31526/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR59/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

The two other groups had a high spontaneous 3H-TdR but differed with respect to the D3-induced differentiation which was absent in one group (n = 6) and present in the other (n = 5). The two groups showed no difference in the clinical features.","['Hellstrom, E', 'Robert, K H', 'Soppi, E', 'Ost, A', 'Putkonen, P O', 'Gahrton, G']","['Hellstrom E', 'Robert KH', 'Soppi E', 'Ost A', 'Putkonen PO', 'Gahrton G']","['Department of Medicine, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(12):1113-21. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90157-4.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90157-4 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Normal and neoplastic B cells respond differently to TPA.,1105-11,"According to the pattern of IgM biosynthesis (membrane expression and secretion), human B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (B-CLLs) were subgrouped into four classes, namely: class I: membrane- secretion-; class II: membrane+ secretion-; class III: membrane+ secretion+; class IV: membrane- secretion+. Abundant membrane mu chain mRNA was present in cells from all cases, indicating that translational and/or post translational events were responsible for the absence of surface IgM in classes I and IV. Similarly, post translational events blocked IgM secretion in non secreting B-CLL cells. In B-CLLs from classes I, II and III, TPA induced IgM secretion by up-regulating secretory mu chain mRNA. By contrast, in normal B cells, TPA induced down-regulation of the secretory form of Ig mRNA, irrespective of the maturational stage of the cell. These observations indicate that IgM biosynthesis is modulated differently by TPA in normal and malignant B cells.","['Guazzi, S', 'Sitia, R', 'Rubartelli, A']","['Guazzi S', 'Sitia R', 'Rubartelli A']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(12):1105-11. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90156-2.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90156-2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Differential preclinical responses of irradiated male dogs in progression to either aplastic anemia or myeloproliferative disease.,1069-84,"Male beagles chronically exposed to low daily doses of 60Co gamma rays (7.5 cGy/22h/day) show one of three hematopoietic patterns, which reflect three different distinctly responding subgroups: (1) low radioresistance with progressing aplastic anemia and shortened survival (-S-AA subgroup); (2) high radioresistance with a complex of progressing myeloproliferative disorders (+R-MPD group); or (3) high radioresistance with other nonMPD syndromes (+R-nonMPD group). Blood cell levels (granulocytes, monocytes, erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and platelets) were assessed and fitted to a flexible polynomial spline model, thus defining the (a) initial suppressive and (b) subsequent recovery phases for the subgroups. Results showed that relative to the overall magnitude of blood cell loss as well as to the maximum rate of suppression during the initial phase, the subgroups were generally ranked -S-AA much greater than +R-MPD greater than +R-nonMPD. Relative to the overall strength of the recovery response, the subgroups were generally ranked +R-MPD greater than +R-nonMPD much much greater than -S-AA. In terms of overall maintenance levels of circulating blood cells during the recovery phase, however, the +R-nonMPD subgroup consistently exhibited stronger responses than the +R-MPD subgroup. These results tend to support our contention that selected subgroups of dogs have strong propensities to specific hematopathologies (i.e. aplastic anemia and myeloid leukemia) under chronic irradiation and that these pathology-prone animals exhibit a series of marked differential hematopoietic responses during early preclinical phases, which serve effectively to prognosticate subsequent pathological progression.","['Seed, T M', 'Carnes, B A', 'Tolle, D V', 'Fritz, T E']","['Seed TM', 'Carnes BA', 'Tolle DV', 'Fritz TE']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439-4833.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Adaptation, Physiological', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*etiology', 'Animals', 'Blood Cells/*radiation effects', 'Blood Platelets/radiation effects', 'Dogs', 'Erythrocytes/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays/*adverse effects', 'Leukocytes/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*etiology', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation, Ionizing']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(12):1069-84. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90152-5.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90152-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

2615462,NLM,MEDLINE,19900312,20190824,13,12,1989,Is transplantation in first remission AML more effective than in advanced leukemia?,1035-8,"These data indicate that the increment in the anti-leukemia effect, as expressed as FFR, is comparable for transplants for AML in first remission, advanced leukemia, and in persons never achieving remission. These data are consistent with the notion that the major anti-leukemia effect of HLA-identical bone marrow transplantation in AML results from an immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect rather than from high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. Of course, other factors might explain these results. The superior outcome observed for transplants in first remission versus more advanced disease results not from increased anti-leukemia efficacy of transplants but rather that more persons already cured by chemotherapy receive transplants. Otherwise stated, a substantial portion of the persons cured following transplantation for AML in first remission were cured before receiving a transplant. These data have implications for other aspects of bone marrow transplantation. For example, it is suggested that transplants should be performed earlier in solid tumors when these diseases are more likely to respond to high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. Although this hypothesis may be correct, it need not necessarily be so as evidenced by these data in AML. The data we review show that bone marrow transplants in AML are of comparable anti-leukemia efficacy when performed in first remission, advanced leukemia, and initial resistant disease. Similar conclusions may apply to transplants in CML and ALL. The superior overall outcome observed with transplants in earlier leukemia results from transplanting a greater proportion of subjects already cured by chemotherapy. The increased anti-leukemia efficacy of transplants when compared with chemotherapy is compatible with an anti-leukemia effect other than that of high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. An immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia effect is a likely explanation. Caution in predicting results of autotransplants in solid tumors is likewise necessary.","['Gale, R P', 'Butturini, A']","['Gale RP', 'Butturini A']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(12):1035-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90147-1.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90147-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

They reduced pneumonia from 30 to 0 in 106 patients with acute leukemia during their first induction treatment. Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is one of the most intensive immunosuppressive treatments. Major causes of failure were interstitial pneumonitis (IP) due to cytomegalovirus (CMV), relapse of leukemia and bacterial and fungal infections. The incidence of IP was reduced by fractionation of total body irradiation and selection of CMV antibody negative donor for platelet transfusion. Administration of anti CMV immunoglobulin has also reduced the incidence of IP significantly from 37.5% to 11.5%. Colony stimulating factor appeared to stimulate the recovery of leukocytes after BMT. By several modifications of BMT techniques, mainly for the prevention of infection and IP, the survival of patients after BMT has improved significantly from 20% to 85%.

Twenty two patients were subjected to this combination therapy; among these, 18 patients were evaluable for the effectiveness. They included 9 cases of leukemia, 5 cases of malignant lymphoma, 2 cases of aplastic anemia, and 2 cases of angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia. Excellent responses were obtained in 5 patients and good responses in 5 patients, with a total effectiveness of 55.6%. Efficacy rates for individual types of infections were; 2/2 in sepsis, 6/14, or 42.9% in suspected sepsis, 1/1 in urinary tract infection, and and 1/1 in upper respiratory infection. The combination treatment was also effective in 4 of 6 cases in which neutrophil counts were less than 500/mm3 prior to therapy. Side effects were observed in only one patient. Mild proteinuria occurred in a 80-year-old male in 6 days after the regimen was started, but was not serious.

PEG was administered before and after the children received their weekly oral or intramuscular doses of MTX. PEG recoveries from a 6-h urine collection were calculated by a mathematical formula to determine the polymer with maximal recovery (PCD0) and the polymer whose recovery was 50% of PCD0 (N1/2). Compared with pre-MTX levels, a significant increase was observed in the polymer with maximal recovery (PCD0) in 15/19 children after MTX administration (p less than 0.015) which indicated increased transmucosal passage of PEG. A decrease in the PEG parameter (N1/2) was observed in 11/38 studies, and may have indicated diminished enterocyte cell mass.

The break sites in the DNA were translated artificially in the presence of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I and 3H-labelled dTTP, and were visualized by autoradiographic observation of the grains. The DNA strand breaks in the HeLa cells increased in a dose-dependent manner, compared with findings in the untreated control cells, i.e., 15.2 fold at 20 micrograms/ml of ADR for 1 h. This level correlated with DNA single-strand breaks detected by the alkaline elution method. DNA breaks were also noted in the ADR-sensitive P388 cells, but in the ADR-resistant cells the level of DNA strand breaks was low. The enhanced cytotoxicity is apparently the consequence of the enhanced potential of ADR to cause breaks in the DNA strands. Our findings show that the survival response of the cells decreases and the level of DNA strand breaks increases following exposure to ADR. ADR resistance may be mediated by a reduction in the level of DNA strand breaks.","['Maehara, Y', 'Emi, Y', 'Anai, H', 'Sakaguchi, Y', 'Kohnoe, S', 'Tsujitani, S', 'Sugimachi, K']","['Maehara Y', 'Emi Y', 'Anai H', 'Sakaguchi Y', 'Kohnoe S', 'Tsujitani S', 'Sugimachi K']","['Department of Surgery II, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line/drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 1989 Dec;159(4):323-7. doi: 10.1002/path.1711590410.,0022-3417 (Print) 0022-3417 (Linking),,['10.1002/path.1711590410 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

No significant difference in the sTfR levels among the patients was observed, although the difference between the healthy individuals and the patient groups was shown to be statistically significant at p less than 0.01 level. The effect of sTfR isolated from serum of a patient with iron-deficiency anemia by means of Sephadex G-200 column for natural killer activity was carried out. Cytotoxicity of natural killer cell in healthy individuals was inhibited by sTfR as the dose dependent manner, and the inhibitory rate was found to be 23.1 +/- 12.8% (Mean +/- SD) when the concentration of the sTfR was 1,250 U added in the cytotoxicity test. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of serum in cancer patients was correlated with the sTfR level. These results suggest that sTfR is one of the inhibitory factors for the natural killer cell activity in vivo, and the factor could be facilitated for tumor growth and metastasis.

These data provide conclusive evidence that LDH does not help in defining the prognosis of adult ANLL, either because enzyme activity fails to reflect the number and proliferation rate of leukemic cells efficiently, or because with current standard treatment these features are of borderline importance, in contrast with acute lymphocytic leukemia and malignant lymphomas.","['Fasola, G', 'Zuffa, E', 'Fanin, R', 'Michieli, M', 'Gallizia, C', 'Damiani, D', 'Russo, D', 'Visani, G', 'Resegotti, L', 'Comotti, B']","['Fasola G', 'Zuffa E', 'Fanin R', 'Michieli M', 'Gallizia C', 'Damiani D', 'Russo D', 'Visani G', 'Resegotti L', 'Comotti B', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Scienze Mediche, Universita di Udine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Biol Markers,The International journal of biological markers,8712411,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Biol Markers. 1989 Jul-Sep;4(3):142-9.,0393-6155 (Print) 0393-6155 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Bone marrows were cultured from forty eight subjects, including normal controls and patients with acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome. Observer error was least with the disc cultures, whereas variation between replicate cultures was similar for both methods. A high degree of correlation was found between the two methods for both day 7 (r = 0.90) and day 14 (r = 0.91) cultures. The number of colonies and clusters was higher with the disc system, indicating better cloning efficiency.

The outcome of 72 episodes of neutropenic fever was determined and correlated with the presence or absence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. Twenty four patients had mucocutaneous HSV infection during at least one episode. In 24 episodes in which HSV was isolated only 12.5% of fevers responded to antibiotics and 75% of fevers were otherwise unexplained. Conversely, in 48 episodes of neutropenic fever in which HSV was not isolated 67% of fevers responded to antibiotics and only 8.3% were unexplained. The difference in incidence of antibiotic resistant fever in the two groups was significant. There was, therefore, a strong association between mucocutaneous HSV infection and antibiotic resistant fever in immunosuppressed neutropenic patients. As most HSV infections are the result of virus reactivation, establishing the HSV serological state of patients would identify those at risk of infection and hence those in whom the prophylactic use of acyclovir would be indicated.","['Baglin, T P', 'Gray, J J', 'Marcus, R E', 'Wreghitt, T G']","['Baglin TP', 'Gray JJ', 'Marcus RE', 'Wreghitt TG']","[""Department of Haematology, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)'],IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Fever/complications/drug therapy', 'Herpes Simplex/*complications/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Virus Activation']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1989 Dec;42(12):1255-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.42.12.1255.,0021-9746 (Print) 0021-9746 (Linking),,['10.1136/jcp.42.12.1255 [doi]'],,PMC502050,,,,,,,,

It was found that hemin-associated glutathione-S-transferase tends to lose its native structure as expressed by partial irreversible inhibition of glutathione conjugation activity. In K-562 cells, a small increase in heme synthesis was induced, but under no condition could glutathione-S-transferase be elevated. In addition, introduction of high hemin from without caused large hemoglobin production but did not induce changes in the glutathione-S-transferase content. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced Friend murine erythroleukemia cells synthesized a large amount of endogenous hemin that had to be transported from the mitochondria for hemoglobin synthesis. Although a concomitant increase in glutathione-S-transferase level (20-40%) was observed, it was only short-lived, unlike hemin, which continued to increase. These data indicate a lack of correlation between glutathione-S-transferase and hemin or hemoglobin levels. Finally, dimethyl sulfoxide-induced cells were treated with succinyl acetone to inhibit heme synthesis. These cells showed the same increased levels and time-dependent pattern of glutathione-S-transferase as untreated cells. A similar phenomenon was observed when different substrates were used to measure the activities of glutathione-S-transferases. These results raise doubts about the possibility of glutathione-S-transferases functioning as heme carriers in cells.","['Kirschner-Zilber, I', 'Laufer, H', 'Shaklai, N']","['Kirschner-Zilber I', 'Laufer H', 'Shaklai N']","['Sackler Institute of Molecular Medicine, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport, Active/physiology', '*Carrier Proteins', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Globins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glutathione Transferase/analysis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives', 'Hemin/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1989 Nov;41(3):113-23. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240410302.,0730-2312 (Print) 0730-2312 (Linking),,['10.1002/jcb.240410302 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the intracellular mechanisms, the roles of Ca2+ mobilization and protein phosphorylation in the activation of the cells were examined. F(ab')2 fragment of anti-immunoglobulin (anti-Ig), which cross-links membrane-bound Ig, and calcium ionophore A23187 caused a rapid increase in the intracellular free calcium concentration [( Ca2+]i), whereas these stimulants did not give rise to differentiation of the cells. In contrast, treatment with IL5 did not affect either [Ca2+]i or the rates of Ca2+ uptake from the outside and release from the inside of the cells. Analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the in vitro phosphorylation of acidic 80-, 60-, and 45-kDa proteins was induced upon stimulation with IL5. Treatment with IL5 also caused a marked decrease in the in vitro phosphorylation of an acidic 100-kDa protein which was highly phosphorylated in the unstimulated state. Addition of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) to the culture inhibited IL5-mediated differentiative responses. Therefore, these results suggest that Ca2+ mobilization is not involved but activities of stimulatory and inhibitory kinases may be involved in the IL5-mediated differentiation process.","['Yamaguchi, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Harada, N', 'Takatsu, K']","['Yamaguchi N', 'Takahashi T', 'Harada N', 'Takatsu K']","['Department of Biology, Kumamoto University Medical School.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biochem. 1989 Nov;106(5):837-43. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a122940.,0021-924X (Print) 0021-924X (Linking),,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a122940 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

However, in some cell types, such as embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells or normal bone-marrow cells the expression of genes introduced by retroviral vectors has been very inefficient. This expression block has severely hampered the application of retroviral vector systems in those cell types. The enhancer sequences present in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of retroviruses are known to be responsible for the tissue specificity of viral expression. Therefore, we set out to construct a vector in which this enhancer element has been replaced. A recombinant retrovirus was constructed in which the enhancer from the Moloney murine leukemia virus LTR was replaced by the enhancer of a mutant polyoma virus (PyF101) that was selected to grow on EC cells. A neomycin-resistance marker (neoR) was placed under the transcriptional control of the hybrid LTR. Following infection with this virus, neoR was expressed in EC cells, as well as in the hemopoietic progenitor cells present in normal murine bone marrow. Moreover, upon transplantation of infected bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated mice, neoR expression was sustained in hemopoietic cells of the engrafted recipients.","['Valerio, D', 'Einerhand, M P', 'Wamsley, P M', 'Bakx, T A', 'Li, C L', 'Verma, I M']","['Valerio D', 'Einerhand MP', 'Wamsley PM', 'Bakx TA', 'Li CL', 'Verma IM']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,['I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial/genetics', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Viral', '*Genetic Vectors', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neomycin/pharmacology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Proviruses/genetics', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transfection', 'Virus Cultivation']",1989/12/14 00:00,1989/12/14 00:01,['1989/12/14 00:00'],"['1989/12/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/14 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1989 Dec 14;84(2):419-27. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(89)90516-7.,0378-1119 (Print) 0378-1119 (Linking),,"['0378-1119(89)90516-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(89)90516-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Patients were selected with regard to clinical signs and symptoms of the disease. 39 patients had progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia of B-cell type (B-CLL): 16 with lymph node enlargement and 14 with progressive lymphocytosis as the most prominent symptom, respectively. 1 patient had an isolated splenomegaly and 8 had symptoms from enlarged lymph nodes, lymphocytosis and/or splenomegaly. 25 patients had an isolated monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis in blood and bone-marrow but no other signs or symptoms of the disease. The lymphocytosis in these patients was considered to be of ""undetermined significance"" and the term B-cell lymphocytosis of undetermined significance (B-MLUS) was used. Patients with a prominent lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly had CD22+ leukemic cells while in patients with a progressive lymphocytosis the B-cell clone expressed Leu-8. Thus, CD22 might be related to the homing capacity of B lymphocytes for lymphnodes and spleen, while Leu-8 might define a circulating B-cell subset. In B-MLUS about 50% of the monoclonal B cells co-expressed Leu8 which is consistent with a more differentiated phenotype compared to B-CLL with progressive lymphocytosis. The CD22 expression was mostly low in B-MLUS although a few patients showed high values. The expression of receptors for growth factors (CD23, CD25, CD71) was higher in B-CLL compared to B-MLUS patients (p less than 0.001), which is consistent with a difference in lymphocyte activation stage and/or response to growth factors.","['Kimby, E', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Bjorkholm, M', 'Holm, G']","['Kimby E', 'Mellstedt H', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Holm G']","['Department of Medicine, Danderyd Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/analysis/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis/immunology', 'Splenomegaly/immunology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1989 Nov;43(5):452-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00335.x.,0902-4441 (Print) 0902-4441 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1989.tb00335.x [doi]'],,,,['Eur J Haematol. 1990 Nov;45(5):285-6.

2612161,NLM,MEDLINE,19900307,20190919,20,1-4,1989,The onset and progression of osteoblast differentiation is functionally related to cellular proliferation.,3-13,"The relationship of proliferation to the developmental sequence associated with bone cell differentiation was examined in primary osteoblast cultures derived from fetal rat and embryonic chick calvaria. A reciprocal and functional relationship exists between the decline in proliferative activity which occurs during the initial stages of the developmental sequence and the induction of genes encoding osteoblast phenotype proteins associated with matrix maturation and mineralization. This relationship is supported by 1) a temporal sequence of events in which there is an enhanced expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and osteopontin (OP) genes immediately following the proliferative period and expression of osteocalcin with the onset of mineralization, and 2) increases in AP and OP when DNA synthesis is inhibited. By determining cellular mRNA levels and rates of mRNA synthesis in isolated nuclei, we found that the down-regulation of cell growth-related genes is modified at both the levels of transcription and mRNA stability. For a histone gene where down-regulation is transcriptionally mediated, we have observed that the shutdown of osteoblast proliferation is associated with the selective loss of the interaction of a promoter binding factor (HiNF-D) with a proximal regulatory element (Site II). A relationship between Site II occupancy by HiNF-D and the onset of osteoblast differentiation is supported by the persistence of Site II-HiNF-D interactions when proliferating rat osteoblasts are growth arrested under conditions that do not induce differentiation; and additionally, by the loss of Site II-HiNF-D interactions during the shut-down of proliferation when HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells are induced to differentiate into monocytes. Our results are consistent with a requirement of proliferation for expression of genes involved with production, deposition and possibly organization of the osteoblast extracellular matrix. It is also reasonable to postulate that properties of the mineralizing matrix are related to the shut-down of proliferation.","['Stein, G S', 'Lian, J B', 'Gerstenfeld, L G', 'Shalhoub, V', 'Aronow, M', 'Owen, T', 'Markose, E']","['Stein GS', 'Lian JB', 'Gerstenfeld LG', 'Shalhoub V', 'Aronow M', 'Owen T', 'Markose E']","['University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Department of Cell Biology, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Connect Tissue Res,Connective tissue research,0365263,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Osteoblasts/*cytology/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Biosynthesis/physiology', 'Rats', 'Skull/cytology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Connect Tissue Res. 1989;20(1-4):3-13. doi: 10.3109/03008208909023869.,0300-8207 (Print) 0300-8207 (Linking),,['10.3109/03008208909023869 [doi]'],"['AR33920/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32010/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL29814/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

Subjects were identified from employment records at four companies that have produced or used ethylene oxide since the 1950s and at eight hospitals which have had ethylene oxide sterilising units since the 1960s. The cohort represents a substantial proportion of the British workforce with a history of occupational exposure to ethylene oxide. Industrial hygiene data were not available before 1977, but since then time weighted average exposures have been less than 5 ppm in almost all jobs and less than 1 ppm in many. Past exposures were probably somewhat higher. In contrast to some previous studies, no clear excess of leukaemia (three deaths observed, 2.09 expected) and no increase in stomach cancer (five deaths observed, 5.95 expected) were found. This discrepancy with earlier reports may be due in part to differences in levels of exposure. Total cancer mortality was similar to that expected from national and local death rates. Some specific cancers showed small excesses but their relevance to ethylene oxide exposure is doubtful. Again, contrary to some earlier reports, no excess of cardiovascular disease was found. This study does not exclude the possibility that ethylene oxide is a human carcinogen but suggests that any risk of cancer from currently permitted occupational exposures is small.","['Gardner, M J', 'Coggon, D', 'Pannett, B', 'Harris, E C']","['Gardner MJ', 'Coggon D', 'Pannett B', 'Harris EC']","['MRC Environmental Epidemiology Unit, University of Southampton, Southampton General Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Ind Med,British journal of industrial medicine,0370637,['JJH7GNN18P (Ethylene Oxide)'],IM,"['Cardiovascular Diseases/chemically induced/mortality', 'Cohort Studies', 'Coronary Disease/chemically induced/mortality', 'England/epidemiology', 'Ethylene Oxide/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Wales/epidemiology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Ind Med. 1989 Dec;46(12):860-5. doi: 10.1136/oem.46.12.860.,0007-1072 (Print) 0007-1072 (Linking),,['10.1136/oem.46.12.860 [doi]'],,PMC1009883,,,,,,,,

The question of the emergence of multiple myeloma (MM) from a tumorous pre-B cell is not yet resolved. To draw a comparison with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), we studied the VH(V) rearrangements in 28 MM patients. A rearranged Hind III-Bam HI fragment of 9.5 kb was detected in only one patient instead of the rearranged fragment of 8.5 kb described in CLL. Rearrangements of a member of the VH(V) family in a 9.5 kb fragment were also observed in two out of 20 lymphoblastoid cell lines obtained from peripheral blood of MM patients. We report here that the VH(V) family is not preferentially involved in this pathology and that the size of the only rearrangement obtained is larger than the 8.5 kb fragment observed in CLL.

This selective effect on day-7 colonies was quantitatively similar for both normal and CGL (P greater than 0.5). Similar results were obtained whether or not the mononuclear preparations were depleted of potential accessory cells, suggesting that the alpha IFN-suppression is directly mediated. Morphological examination of colonies and clusters showed that IFN had no effect on cell maturation and that colony inhibition is not, therefore, a consequence of blocked maturation. Since the late-progenitor compartment is preferentially expanded in CGL, we suggest that our demonstration that alpha IFN selectively inhibits this compartment is relevant to the clinical effects of the cytokine in the disease.","['Galvani, D W', 'Cawley, J C']","['Galvani DW', 'Cawley JC']","['University Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Interferon Type I)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Dec;73(4):475-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00283.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00283.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Both cell surface changes and monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion were followed as markers of differentiation. The results indicate great similarity in the differentiation patterns induced by interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and interleukin-4 (IL-4), with regard to Ig secretion and changes in surface markers. Induction of Ig secretion and surface marker changes by 8-bromo-guanosine was similar to that induced by TPA and PWM; however, for some markers, cell surface changes induced by TPA and PWM or by 8-bromo-guanosine were quite different from those induced by the three interleukins tested. Whereas all three interleukins stimulated the expression of CD5, PWM and TPA and 8-bromo-guanosine substantially decreased CD5 expression on B lymphoma cells. Differences were also observed in the effect on the expression of surface Ig and on the expression of CD19 and CD20. Interestingly, the three interleukins tested and 8-bromo-guanosine induced differentiation and Ig secretion within 24 to 48 hours with no prior activation by B-cell activators, such as anti-surface Ig antibody. These results suggest that leukemic B cells are arrested at a point distal to activation and first cell division. Moreover, the similarity in Ig secretion and surface changes induced by TPA and PWM or 8-bromo-guanosine suggest a similar pathway; however, this pathway is different from the differentiation signal induced by the three interleukins.","['Gazitt, Y', 'Gangavalli, A', 'Thurman, G B']","['Gazitt Y', 'Gangavalli A', 'Thurman GB']","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Biother,Molecular biotherapy,8904897,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '4016-63-1 (8-bromoguanosine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', '*Antigens, Surface', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Guanosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*metabolism', 'Interleukins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Biother. 1989;1(6):297-304.,0952-8172 (Print) 0952-8172 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The cases are formed by all patients with leukemia, a brain tumors or a neuroblastoma treated in three pediatric hospitals in Brussels. For each case, two controls matched for age and sex, are recruited from the same hospitals. One control group is formed by all other cancer patients and a second group includes children hospitalized in the departments of surgery. The parents of the cases and the controls are interviewed about their occupations and occupational exposure in the past and the present. The occupational physicians are asked to supply a questionnaire about the occupational history of the employee. At the end of March 1990 the study will be closed. 20 parents of cases and 8 parents of control persons are already interviewed but we have no results yet.","['De Quint, P']",['De Quint P'],,['dut'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Belgium,Arch Belg,Archives belges = Belgisch archief,8302753,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Belgium', '*Carcinogens', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Neoplasms/chemically induced/*etiology', '*Parents']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Belg. 1989;47(1-4):113-7.,,"Kanker bij kinderen--relatie met de beroepshalve blootstelling aan fysische, chemische en/of biologische agentia van de ouders?",,,,,,,,,,,

Our design, which we call an electroporation cylinder, improved transfection efficiency over that of a uniform field design (electroporation cuvettes) by about sixfold when tested in five mouse cell lines with a transient gene expression assay. Electroporation cylinders subjected cells to electrical field strengths at least as powerful as those of electroporation cuvettes, as judged by comparing the percentages of cells killed by electroporation. Cylinder and cuvette designs were similar in their effect on the variability of transfection efficiency. Electroporation cylinders may be particularly useful when the optimal electrical field strength for a cell line is not known or is unattainable with a given power supply.","['Hollon, T', 'Yoshimura, F K']","['Hollon T', 'Yoshimura FK']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Washington, Seattle 98195.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids/genetics', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1989 Nov 1;182(2):253-6. doi: 10.1016/0003-2697(89)90589-7.,0003-2697 (Print) 0003-2697 (Linking),,"['0003-2697(89)90589-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-2697(89)90589-7 [doi]']",['CA-44166/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic has led to increased concern about occupationally acquired infections in health-care workers. As the number of HIV-infected persons increases, so does the risk of infection. Occupationally acquired HIV infection of health-care workers occurs principally in nurses, phlebotomists, and laboratory technicians through accidental subcutaneous injection of contaminated blood; splashing of blood onto open skin lesions, the eyes, and mucous membranes represents another route of exposure. The risk of infection from a single needle-stick exposure to HIV-infected blood is about 0.4%. Other blood-borne viruses to which employees are vulnerable include hepatitis B virus and human T-cell lymphotropic viruses, which may cause leukemia and lymphoma. SFGH has a comprehensive infection control system. Specimen containers are enclosed in transparent secondary containers, the worker is encouraged to wear protective clothing when necessary, and specific needle-stick precautions are promoted. There is also a health-care worker protection and education plan. The employee health services department provides immunizations, keeps records on accidental exposures, and operates a hot line. The education committee disseminates educational materials and arranges lectures. Infection control and education provide simple but effective measures for protecting hospital employees against HIV and other occupationally acquired infections.","['Hadley, W K']",['Hadley WK'],"['San Francisco General Hospital, CA 94110.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hosp Pharm,American journal of hospital pharmacy,0370474,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/prevention & control/transmission', 'HIV Infections/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Health Education', 'Hepatitis B/prevention & control/*transmission', 'Hospitals, General', 'Humans', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Personnel, Hospital', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hosp Pharm. 1989 Dec;46(12 Suppl 3):S4-7.,0002-9289 (Print) 0002-9289 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Several ways of presenting geographic variation in mortality rates due to potentially work-related deaths and changes in these rates over time are discussed for the 15-year period from 1969 through 1983. Causes of death that are potentially work-related were identified using the sentinel health events (occupational) [SHE(O)] concept. Data are given for nine diagnostic groups of occupationally related disorders, and maps are presented for bladder cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and pneumoconioses. Significant changes in age-adjusted mortality rates were noted for pneumoconioses and acute myeloid leukemia that could not be due to changes in the disease coding of death certificates. Racial differences in mortality rates due to pneumoconioses may be due to differences in employment patterns. The use of SHE(O) codes to search the Compressed Mortality File may be helpful in identifying areas for public health concern, even if only as a monitoring signal for subsequent time periods. This file also provides an easy way to generate reference population mortality rates for epidemiologic studies.","['Wagener, D K', 'Buffler, P A']","['Wagener DK', 'Buffler PA']","['Division of Epidemiology and Health Promotion, National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, MD 20782.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality', 'Lung Diseases/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'National Center for Health Statistics, U.S.', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Pneumoconiosis/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mortality']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 1989;16(4):355-72. doi: 10.1002/ajim.4700160404.,0271-3586 (Print) 0271-3586 (Linking),,['10.1002/ajim.4700160404 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with VP-16 (15 mg/kg) and ara-C (25 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally on days 1, 4, and 7 after tumor inoculation. Three-hour pretreatment with VP-16 followed by ara-C produced 70% of cure rate, but only 20% of cure rate was obtained with the reverse sequence. Simultaneous administration led to the worst therapeutic result. To clarify this sequence-dependent interaction of the both drugs, the effect of VP-16 on incorporation of ara-C into DNA was investigated in vivo. On day 3 after intraperitoneal transplantation of 1 x 10(6) L1210 cells, 15 mg/kg of VP-16 and 1 microCi of (3H)ara-C was administered intraperitoneally with or without time interval. The effect of VP-16 on ara-C incorporation was also strikingly schedule-dependent and compatible with the schedule dependency of the antitumor effect. At 1 hr after injection of ara-C, simultaneous administration of 15 mg/kg of VP-16 reduced ara-C incorporation by 67% of ara-C injection alone. But in sharp contrast to simultaneous-administration, 3 hour preadministration of VP-16 increased ara-C incorporation up to 247%. From 1 to 6 hour after intraperitoneal administration of 15 mg/kg of VP-16, the sedimentation rate of L1210 DNA was increasing on alkaline sucrose gradients. This repairing period from VP-16 induced DNA damage might be the vulnerable time to ara-C through an increase in ara-C incorporation into DNA.","['Ohkubo, T', 'Hori, H', 'Higashigawa, M', 'Kawasaki, H', 'Kamiya, H', 'Sakurai, M', 'Kagawa, Y', 'Kakito, E', 'Sumida, K', 'Ooi, K']","['Ohkubo T', 'Hori H', 'Higashigawa M', 'Kawasaki H', 'Kamiya H', 'Sakurai M', 'Kagawa Y', 'Kakito E', 'Sumida K', 'Ooi K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Mie University, School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1989;253B:355-62. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4684-5676-9_52.,0065-2598 (Print) 0065-2598 (Linking),,['10.1007/978-1-4684-5676-9_52 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

RB virus was produced by passing high titers of the wild-type Friend virus (Lilly-Steeves polycythemia-producing strain) through adult Fv-2rr mice. Titration of the defective spleen focus-forming virus indicated RB virus infected similar numbers of Fv-2ss or Fv-2rr target cells. Analysis of the spleens from mice infected with RB virus indicated that RB induced the early stage of Friend disease (erythroid proliferation) in both Fv-2rr and Fv-2ss mice. Fv-2ss mice infected with RB virus developed the classical Friend disease within 3 weeks.

In this study a leukemic progenitor cell assay was used to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of marrow-purging protocols that employed hyperthermia or 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) against leukemic blasts obtained from patients. After the treatment of 2 x 10(7) nucleated bone marrow cells/ml with 100 micrograms/ml of 4HC in the presence of 7% suspension of packed autologous erythrocytes, leukemic colonies were eradicated in 10 of 13 cases and reduced to less than 0.3% as compared with the colony count in untreated cultures in two cases. More than 10% of leukemic progenitor cells survived after hyperthermia treatment (42 degrees C 60 min) in 7 of 9 cases.

Post-(x-)irradiation incubation at 25 degrees C protects LY-S cells against the fixation of biologically expressed damage which takes place at 37 degrees C. An optimal condition for the repair of damage, assayed in split-dose experiments as split-dose recovery (SDR), is 1 h at 37 degrees C followed by 4 h holding at 25 degrees C prior to the second half of a split dose, or 5 h holding at 25 degrees C without a 37 degrees C incubation during the interval between doses. Longer incubations at 37 degrees C resulted in progressively decreased survivals. Postirradiation inhibition of DNA synthesis at 37 degrees C was observed only during the first 30 min; thereafter, 3H-dThdR incorporation was higher than in unirradiated controls. The excess synthesis effect was removed by shifting irradiated cells to 25 degrees C holding. The inhibition observed at 25 degrees C was reversed by shifting to 37 degrees C. Thus the degree of postirradiation DNA synthesis is inversely related to SDR. DNA filter elution shows complete strand break repair by 20 min at 37 degrees C, and by 3 h at 25 degrees C; DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair plateaus at 80% (37 degrees C) and 60% (25 degrees C) after 90 min. An inverse correlation was found between total strand break repair rate, as assayed by filter elution methods, and cell survival.

The factors predisposing to the development of DIC were: 1) the type of AL (p less than 0.01), as 70% of AML-M3 had DIC; 2) the intensity of granulation in leukemia cells (p less than 0.004); 3) the presence of Auer's rods and/or splinters in these cells, and 4) the presence of hemorrhagic diathesis (p less than 0.007). Eight of the 14 patients with DIC received heparin at a prophylactic dosage. No significant differences in the clinical course were in the group of patients with DIC who received heparin and in those who did not, excepting that in the former the platelet requirements were higher (p less than 0.005). Mortality rate during the first month was higher in the group of AL with DIC than in AL without DIC (p less than 0.025). Long term mortality was similar in both groups. The control of hemostasis is fundamental in AL, even in those patients without DIC at the time of diagnosis. The administration of blood derivatives has a high priority in AL with DIC.

The LL-2 cells were near-tetraploid cells isolated from mouse myeloid leukemia cell line M1 (clone D501). In suspension culture, the LL-2 cells were myeloblastic and grew well like parent D501 cells, but were distinct from the parental cells due to the large size of their nucleus, double chromosome number and DNA content. The LL-2 cells as well as D501 cells could be induced to differentiate in vitro into mature macrophage-like cells by a protein inducer of differentiation. After transplantation of 4 X 10(6) LL-2 cells into the intraperitoneal cavity of syngeneic SL mice, most of them died of leukemia within 10 weeks. On microscopic examination of the peritoneal cells of the mice, the transplanted LL-2 cells were clearly distinguishable from normal host cells by the size of their nucleus. We determined the increase in the LL-2 cells in the peritoneal cavity by morphological examination of the large-sized LL-2 cells. Survival times of the mice inoculated with the LL-2 cells were prolonged by administrations of an inducer of differentiation, poly(I).poly(C). We found morphological changes in the peritoneal blastic LL-2 cells to mature macrophage-like cells after the serial administrations of poly(I).poly(C) to the recipient mice. Thus the aneuploid LL-2 cells that grow in syngeneic mice may be useful to study in vivo differentiation and proliferation of leukemia cells, and to develop a therapeutic strategy of leukemia using various treatments including differentiation inducers.","['Hayashi, M', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hozumi, M']","['Hayashi M', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hozumi M']","['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peritoneal Cavity/pathology', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(11):989-99. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90006-4.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,"['0145-2126(89)90006-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90006-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

In most of the CML patients, the highest values of C.I., speed and the number of motile cells were obtained at FMLP concentrations of 10-100-fold higher than those required for normal PMNL. These results suggest an alteration in the interaction between FMLP and its receptors and that events occurring after FMLP binding are also altered.

Present studies show persistence of such defective cells in the peripheral blood of CML patients in remission. These results also suggest that defects in PMNL from CML patients in remission.

Overall the simultaneous measurements of serum CEA, IAP and CRP levels revealed a potential usefulness for determination of ATL subtype, and serum IAP and CRP levels may provide a way to evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy.","['Kumagai, E', 'Ogata, M', 'Maeda, Y', 'Kumagai, T', 'Okajima, K', 'Yamaguchi, K', 'Tanoue, S']","['Kumagai E', 'Ogata M', 'Maeda Y', 'Kumagai T', 'Okajima K', 'Yamaguchi K', 'Tanoue S']",,['jpn'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

By dividing the 15 years into three five-year periods, we were able to compare patient ratios in the different periods. The proportions of acute to chronic leukemia cases showed no obvious change; however, the proportions of cases diagnosed as acute lymphocytic leukemia in acute leukemia showed a significant increase. The main chemotherapeutic drugs used during the three time periods were cytarabine or its analogues, the anthracyclines, 6-mercaputopurine and prednisolone, against acute myelogenous leukemia, and the vinca alkaloids, prednisolone and the anthracyclines against acute lymphocytic leukemia. The rate of complete remission from acute myelogenous leukemia made marked progress, from 45.1% during 1971-1975 to 62.3% during 1981-1985, but that of acute lymphocytic leukemia showed no significant progress, being 65% during 1971-1975 and 69.7% during 1981-1985. The durations of remission, however, and the survival times for patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, as well as for those with acute myelogenous leukemia, became significantly longer over the three periods. Median survival times from chronic myelocytic leukemia were 37-40 mo in all three periods, showing no progress. There was a better prognosis in cases of chronic myelocytic leukemia with, than without, Philadelphia chromosome. Except for a low incidence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Japan, adult leukemia patients' characteristics and prognoses seem to be almost the same in Japan as in the U.S.A. and Europe.","['Suzuki, H', 'Ota, K', 'Ohno, R', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H', 'Kimura, I', 'Amaki, I', 'Miura, Y', 'Uzuka, Y', 'Kawato, M']","['Suzuki H', 'Ota K', 'Ohno R', 'Masaoka T', 'Shibata H', 'Kimura I', 'Amaki I', 'Miura Y', 'Uzuka Y', 'Kawato M', 'et al.']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Hospital, Nagoya.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Jpn J Clin Oncol,Japanese journal of clinical oncology,0313225,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Clin Oncol. 1989 Dec;19(4):338-47.,0368-2811 (Print) 0368-2811 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

In July, 1987, he noticed a solitary gingival tumor around the left lower second molar. The biopsy showed the massive infiltration of leukemic cells, despite the hematological remission. Combination chemotherapy was not effective but the tumor disappeared by irradiation. A hematological relapse occurred in November, 1987, but the second complete remission was achieved by the AB-triple V therapy. He died because of the second hematological relapse in July, 1988.

N terminal amino acid sequence analysis of purified hIL-5 revealed that a single amino-terminal amino acid (isoleucine) is detected and hIL-5 consists of 115 amino acid residues.","['Mita, S', 'Hosoya, Y', 'Kubota, I', 'Nishihara, T', 'Honjo, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takatsu, K']","['Mita S', 'Hosoya Y', 'Kubota I', 'Nishihara T', 'Honjo T', 'Takahashi T', 'Takatsu K']","['Department of Biology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Biological Assay', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chromatography, Affinity/methods', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-5/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Transfection']",1989/12/20 00:00,1989/12/20 00:01,['1989/12/20 00:00'],"['1989/12/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1989 Dec 20;125(1-2):233-41. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(89)90098-7.,0022-1759 (Print) 0022-1759 (Linking),,"['0022-1759(89)90098-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(89)90098-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Unlike rats, nude mice rarely showed resistance to a second tumor challenge. The observation that concurrent treatment of rats with cyclosporin A did not alter the rate of survival clearly indicated a T-cell-independent mechanism of tumor defense. The incidence of lung colonies from i.v. injected Lewis lung-tumor cells could be enhanced by a high dose pretreatment with mafosfamide or cyclophosphamide, whereas pretreatment at low doses was inhibitory. Since identical experiments carried out in NK-cell-deficient C57Bl/6 ""beige"" mice did not show such an effect, NK cells appeared to represent a possible effector cell in oxazaphosphorine-mediated antitumor effects. This assumption was further supported by the fact that enhanced NK cell activity could be observed in the 51Cr release assay using spleen cells from mafosfamide-treated L5222-bearing rats. The transplantation of the unrelated syngeneic ovarian carcinoma OV-342 to animals that had previously been cured of L5222 leukemia did not lead to the rejection of this tumor. This indicates that a specific resistance against L5222 leukemia had developed. In contrast, a T-cell-dependent antitumor effect was demonstrated for mafosfamide in the MOPC-315 mouse plasmocytoma. Therefore, we conclude that the effector cell for tumor rejection depends on the type of tumor. This, of course, does not exclude a common target cell for the immunopharmacological activity of oxazaphosphorines.","['Reissmann, T', 'Hilgard, P', 'Voegeli, R', 'Zeller, J']","['Reissmann T', 'Hilgard P', 'Voegeli R', 'Zeller J']","['ASTA Pharma AG, Department of Experimental Cancer Research, Bielefeld, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1989;115(6):525-30. doi: 10.1007/BF00391352.,0171-5216 (Print) 0171-5216 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00391352 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Two-dimensional gel patterns of the labeled proteins were unique for each ligand. There were four major retinoylated proteins in MCF-7 consisting of two doublets with molecular masses of 37 kDa and 20 kDa. These proteins were designated 37a, 37b, 20c, and 20d. The extent of retinoylation was very low in a 55 kDa protein that we previously identified in the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL60 [Takahashi, N. and Breitman, T. R. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 5159-5163]. These results indicated that the protein substrates for retinoylation may vary among cell-types. About 10 proteins were labeled from 17 beta-estradiol. Two of these proteins had mobilities that were identical to the retinoylated proteins 37a and 20c. These results indicate that in MCF-7 cells there are two proteins that can be retinoylated and labeled from estradiol. The demonstration that some ligands of the steroid/thyroid receptor family are covalently linked to cellular proteins suggests new mechanisms for the many effects of these agents on cells.","['Takahashi, N', 'Breitman, T R']","['Takahashi N', 'Breitman TR']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol,In vitro cellular & developmental biology : journal of the Tissue Culture Association,8506951,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Estradiol/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,In Vitro Cell Dev Biol. 1989 Dec;25(12):1199-200. doi: 10.1007/BF02621275.,0883-8364 (Print) 0883-8364 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02621275 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In these tumor models, peri-tumoral injections of IL-2 were more effective in inhibiting tumor growth than a systemic treatment. Although s.c. IL-2 treatment resulted in marked inhibition of tumor growth in mice injected s.c. with highly metastatic FLC, it was not effective in inhibiting growth of FLC in the liver and spleen. IL-2 therapy was more effective at increasing survival time in mice transplanted with non-metastatic FLC or with RBL-5 cells. In mice transplanted with HeJ16 fibrosarcomas, s.c. IL-2 treatment resulted in highly significant anti-tumor effect and survival of 70% of tumor-injected mice. No general correlation was found between in vitro sensitivity or resistance to the cytolytic activity of LAK cells and the anti-tumor effects observed in vivo. Subcutaneous injection of IL-1 beta in mice transplanted with highly metastatic FLC resulted in a marked increase in survival time and inhibition of metastatic tumor growth in liver and spleen. Combined treatment of IL-1 beta and IL-2 produced a synergistic anti-tumor effect: 60% of mice injected with highly metastatic FLC survived. Combined IL-1/IL-2 treatments exerted no anti-tumor activity either in DBA/2 mice injected with antibody to Thy 1.2 antigen or in nude mice, indicating that T cells play important roles during IL-1/IL-2 therapy. In vitro treatment of FLC with IL-1 beta resulted in a slight inhibition of cell multiplication, whereas even high doses of IL-2 did not affect FLC multiplication.

Step-wise increase in the number of cells injected led to an increasingly rapid accumulation of untransformed FDC-PI cells in the hemopoietic organs and some shortening of the pre-leukemic phase. FDC-PI cells explanted from pre-leukemic mice differed from primary FDC-PI cells in that they were able to undergo leukemic transformation in non-irradiated recipients after short latent periods. Pre-leukemic populations contained FDC-PI variants with an improved ability to proliferate in non-irradiated tissues. Co-injection of normal marrow cells delayed the leukemic transformation of injected FDC-PI cells. The accelerating effect of prior irradiation of the recipient on leukemia development was also abrogated when the injection of FDC-PI cells was delayed by several weeks. No specific site of transformation could be determined in mice with very early leukemias. Proliferation of untransformed FDC-PI cells and the emergence of variants with improved adaptation to in vivo conditions appear to be important and possibly necessary steps in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The corticoid doses did not differ from those administered to other leukaemia patients without necrosis. Only 1 patient had received prednisone continuously for 1 year, at a total dose of 20.5 g/m2 of body surface area. Of these 6 children, 4 had been immobilized for several weeks before or during therapy.

Its appearance has also correlated with disease activity and tumor burden. Since few studies have been reported concerning SIL-2R in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), work was undertaken to try to find if SIL-2R could be detected in the CSF of patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and whether it could become a clinical predictor of the central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and its response to therapy. Preliminary results showed that 1) the CSF SIL-2R is usually detectable in very low level with a mean of 15.1 +/- 14.2 units/ml compared with the mean serum level of 338.3 +/- 135.5 units/ml in eight normal controls; 2) there was no significant difference in the mean serum and CSF SIL-2R in five patients with ALL in a complete remission state compared with normal controls, while two ALL patients with CNS relapse and two NHL patients with CNS involvement had high levels of SIL-2R in CSF. High serum and low CSF SIL-2R levels were noted in another ALL case suffering from bone marrow relapse but without CNS relapse. It was also noted that decreased CSF SIL-2R concentration occurred subsequent to intrathecal chemotherapy in two ALL patients. From these results, we conclude that CSF SIL-2R might become a useful indicator of CNS involvement in patients with hematological malignancies and may predict response to chemotherapy.","['Chang, C S', 'Liu, H W', 'Lin, S F', 'Chen, T P']","['Chang CS', 'Liu HW', 'Lin SF', 'Chen TP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Kaohsiung Medical College, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China (Republic : 1949- ),Zhonghua Min Guo Wei Sheng Wu Ji Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua Minguo wei sheng wu ji mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of microbiology and immunology,8008067,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*cerebrospinal fluid/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Min Guo Wei Sheng Wu Ji Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi. 1989 May;22(2):132-7.,0253-2662 (Print) 0253-2662 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

A dose-dependent decrease in intracellular spermine concentration was observed in both cell lines when grown in the presence of the inhibitor. A major difference in the effects seen in these two cell lines was the cytotoxicity observed in L1210 cells exposed to the inhibitor, which contrasted with little or no effects on growth of SV 3T3 cells treated similarly. Oxidative metabolism of the drug in L1210 cells was suggested by the fact that addition of aminoguanidine, an amine oxidase inhibitor, to the cell cultures ablated the cytotoxic effects of the inhibitor. Complete analysis of intracellular polyamines was carried out, together with analysis of S-adenosylmethionine, decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine, and the inhibitor. These analyses revealed that, although the inhibitor had a dramatic effect on spermine biosynthesis in the cells studied, a compensatory increase in spermidine biosynthesis was observed. This resulted in no change in total polyamine concentrations in cells treated with inhibitors of either spermine synthase or spermidine synthase (Pegg et al., 1982) alone or in combination. In all cases, the concentration of the aminopropyl donor decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine increased dramatically, thus allowing for the observed maintenance of total polyamine levels even in the presence of either one or both potent inhibitors of the aminopropyltransferases.

The rate of 59Fe internalization was decreased, but the rate and the extent of 125I-Tf endocytosis was unaffected by the addition of haemin. Haemin inhibited 59Fe incorporation into haem by a greater proportion than the overall uptake of 59Fe from Tf. The reduction of total cellular 59Fe uptake was more pronounced at 59Fe-Tf concentrations closer to saturation. Exogenous 5-aminolaevulinic acid stimulated 59Fe utilization for haem synthesis in MELC but did not revert the inhibition induced by haemin. Haem synthesis measured by 14C-glycine incorporation into haem was maintained for at least 1 h without an external transferrin iron source and was inhibited by the addition of haemin equally over the whole range of Tf concentrations studied. Desferrioxamine (DFO) stimulated cellular uptake of 59Fe by the uninduced cells and reverted the inhibition of 59Fe transport into HMBA treated cells caused by haemin. Addition of DFO within a short-term incubation had no effect on haem synthesis measured by 14C-glycine incorporation into haem. No evidence for a direct effect of haem on the transferrin cycle or iron release was found. It was concluded that the reduction of iron uptake by haemin treated MELC is secondary to the decrease in iron utilization for haem synthesis.","['Hradilek, A', 'Neuwirt, J']","['Hradilek A', 'Neuwirt J']","['Institute of Haematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czechoslovakia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Glycine/pharmacokinetics', 'Heme/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Iron/*pharmacokinetics', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Transferrin/*pharmacokinetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Nov;73(3):410-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07762.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb07762.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Three patients had essential thrombocythaemia, two had chronic myeloid leukaemia and six had polycythaemia vera. The numbers of GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa molecules were detected on the platelet surface using different 125I-labelled monoclonal antibodies. The functional properties of GPIb and GPIIb/IIIa were evaluated using purified 125I-labelled asialo von Willebrand factor (vWF) and purified 125I-labelled fibrinogen, respectively, in a binding assay. Binding of the anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibody was decreased by 40% in almost all patients studied and, when measured, it was accompanied by decreased fibrinogen binding to activated platelets. Binding of anti-GPIb antibodies to platelets was also slightly decreased or virtually the same in eight out of 11 patients. The decrease correlated with decreased binding of asialo vWF. The increased plasma glycocalicin levels, measured in four patients, depended on the high platelet count. Scatchard analysis revealed normal receptor binding affinity for all ligands tested in all but one patient. In this report we demonstrate that abnormalities in the concentrations of GPIIb/IIIa membrane proteins are commonly present in patients with MPD, while a decrease in GPIb concentration is also seen, although in fewer patients. These abnormalities are accompanied by a concurrent decrease in the respective receptor functions. These findings may explain part of the haemorrhagic tendency often encountered in MPD.","['Mazzucato, M', 'De Marco, L', 'De Angelis, V', 'De Roia, D', 'Bizzaro, N', 'Casonato, A']","['Mazzucato M', 'De Marco L', 'De Angelis V', 'De Roia D', 'Bizzaro N', 'Casonato A']","['Centro Immunotrasfusionale e Chimica Clinica, C.R.O.

Purine precursors have been synthesized in vitro from [14C]glycine using enzymes from chicken liver. These 14C-labeled intermediates have been used as marker compounds to define retention times for metabolites of leukemia cells separated by HPLC and the chromatographic mobilities of these intermediates after two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography.

Here, we describe the morphological, cytochemical, enzymological, immunological, molecular biological, and functional characteristics of the cell line. The results of this multiparameter profile show that HDLM-2 is different from other well-studied leukemia-lymphoma cell lines including other Hodgkin's disease derived cell lines. HDLM-2 cultures contain mainly mono- or binucleated cells, but also prominent giant cells with two to ten nuclei. HDLM-2 cells do not express an immunophenotype characteristic of a given cell lineage. However, the cells are positive for Ki-1, HeFi-1, Leu-M1, Tac, and HLA class II markers. Cytochemical, enzymological, and functional data are equally inconclusive, but are definitely not compatible with a monocyte/macrophage profile. Analysis of the gene status documents that T-cell receptor beta- and gamma-chain genes are rearranged while immunoglobulin heavy chain genes are in germline configuration. The combined results indicate a T-cell origin of HDLM-2 cells. The evidence available from this and other established Hodgkin's disease derived cell lines suggests a lymphoid origin of Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gignac, S M', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Leber, B F', 'Norton, J', 'Lok, M S', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gignac SM', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Leber BF', 'Norton J', 'Lok MS', 'Minowada J']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, School of Medicine, London, Great Britain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Twenty-six percent of the cohort were treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone, 6% with chemotherapy (CT) alone, and 68% with a combination of RT and CT, either at first line or for salvage treatment. MOPP chemotherapy was given to 42% of the patients. Overall, 19 secondary acute leukemias or preleukemias were observed, 3 of them after extended RT alone, the other 16 after a combination of RT and MOPP. Among the alkylating agents used, only nitrogen mustard (mechloretamine) was shown in a multivariate analysis to be significantly associated (P less than 0.001) with an increased risk of secondary leukemia. A dose response was observed, with the risk relative to general population incidence rates being 45 in patients having been treated with 1-59 mg (total dose) of nitrogen mustard, 211 in those treated with 60-119 mg, and 636 in those treated with greater than or equal to 120 mg. No other factors were found to be associated with leukemia risk. The 10-year cumulative incidence of leukemia was zero in patients treated with limited RT alone, 2.4% in those treated with extended RT alone, 0% in those treated with a combination of RT and CT without nitrogen mustard, and 12.4% in those treated with RT + nitrogen mustard. Whether other alkylating agents give a similar result remains to be determined; these data suggest that the use of nitrogen mustard at a higher total dose than 60 mg is questionable in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease.","['Henry-Amar, M', 'Pellae-Cosset, B', 'Bayle-Weisgerber, C', 'Hayat, M', 'Cosset, J M', 'Carde, P', 'Tubiana, M']","['Henry-Amar M', 'Pellae-Cosset B', 'Bayle-Weisgerber C', 'Hayat M', 'Cosset JM', 'Carde P', 'Tubiana M']","['Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

We have studied the function of the nucleolar targeting signal (NOS) of rex by using full-length proviral DNA and mutant rex expression plasmids. Partial deletions of the NOS sequence abolished the accumulation of unspliced cytoplasmic mRNA, although the gene products of rex mutants were found in the nucleoplasm.

We discovered this gene because of its involvement in a chromosomal translocation associated with the occurrence of a stem cell leukemia manifesting myeloid and lymphoid differentiation capabilities. Here we report the sequence of a cDNA for the normal SCL transcript, as well as for an aberrant fusion transcript produced in the leukemic cells. Although different at their 3' untranslated regions, both cDNAs predict a protein with primary amino acid sequence homology to the previously described amphipathic helix-loop-helix DNA binding and dimerization motif of the Ly1-1, myc, MyoD, immunoglobulin enhancer binding, daughterless, and achaete-scute families of genes. For these cDNAs, at least two different 5' ends are predicted, both of which retain this putative DNA binding domain and predict proteins in the range of 20-30 kDa. SCL mRNA is observed in ""early"" hematopoietic tissues. Taken together, these studies lead to the speculation that SCL plays a role in differentiation and/or commitment events during hematopoiesis.","['Begley, C G', 'Aplan, P D', 'Denning, S M', 'Haynes, B F', 'Waldmann, T A', 'Kirsch, I R']","['Begley CG', 'Aplan PD', 'Denning SM', 'Haynes BF', 'Waldmann TA', 'Kirsch IR']","['Navy-Medical Oncology Branch, National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, MD 20814.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Genes', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Dec;86(24):10128-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.24.10128.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.86.24.10128 [doi]'],,PMC298658,,,['GENBANK/M29038'],,,,,

This complex can be dissociated on a monomeric GALV oligonucleotide affinity column. One protein, termed the core protein, was retained on the oligonucleotide affinity column. The second protein flowed through the oligonucleotide affinity column and, when alone, did not bind to DNA; however, when present with the core protein, it bound strongly and very specifically to the GALV sequence. MLA144 cells contained only trace amounts of c-fos and c-jun by immunoblot analysis, suggesting that the proteins specifically binding to the GALV AP1 site were distinct from c-fos and c-jun. In addition to the major complex that recognized the GALV element, MLA144 cells contained a minor complex that is chromatographically different from and antigenically related to c-fos. The factor in the flowthrough complemented a human T-cell nuclear extract (Jurkat cell line), which, when alone, had no assayable complex that specifically bound to the GALV enhancer; this complementation gave rise to a specific complex similar to that seen in MLA144 cells. Together, these results suggest that the GALV enhancer can interact with multicomponent protein complexes in a cell-line-specific manner.","['Quinn, J P', 'Farina, A R', 'Gardner, K', 'Krutzsch, H', 'Levens, D']","['Quinn JP', 'Farina AR', 'Gardner K', 'Krutzsch H', 'Levens D']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Affinity', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Half-Life', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Hylobates', 'Immunoblotting', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Nov;9(11):4713-21. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.11.4713-4721.1989.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),,['10.1128/mcb.9.11.4713-4721.1989 [doi]'],,PMC363618,,,,,,,,

The proteins that bind to the CCAAT box were present in both undifferentiated and differentiated EC cells. The amounts and the number of species of the proteins that bind to the enhancer and the GC-rich region were far lower in undifferentiated EC cells than in the differentiated counterparts. These proteins were supposed to be transcriptional activators. Proteins that bind upstream of the enhancer, namely, the -352 to -346 region and the -407 to -404 region, were identified. These proteins were designated the embryonic LTR-binding protein (ELP) and the LTR-binding protein, respectively. The ELP was present only in undifferentiated EC cell lines. The LTR-binding protein was detected in all cell lines tested. The mechanism of suppression of the LTR was investigated by the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay. The enhancer and the GC-rich region of the LTR functioned poorly in undifferentiated cells. When eight copies of ELP-binding sequences were inserted upstream of the enhancer region, expression of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene was reduced about threefold in ECA2 cells. From these data, we concluded that two mechanisms, the shortage of activator proteins and the presence of a negative regulatory protein (ELP), are involved in the suppression of the LTR in undifferentiated EC cells.","['Tsukiyama, T', 'Niwa, O', 'Yokoro, K']","['Tsukiyama T', 'Niwa O', 'Yokoro K']","['Department of Pathology, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Embryonal Carcinoma Stem Cells', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Plasmids', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Restriction Mapping', '*Suppression, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Nov;9(11):4670-6. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.11.4670-4676.1989.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),,['10.1128/mcb.9.11.4670-4676.1989 [doi]'],,PMC363613,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate this variability, residual intraindividual variability, and measurement error, we carried out a population study. A sensitive HPLC method allowed analysis of blood samples drawn from 21 patients with breast cancer or acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Individual data treatment (22 kinetics) using weighted nonlinear least squares regression confirmed the huge interindividual variability whatever the administration protocol of mitoxantrone: bi- or tri-exponential models fitted the data. The NONMEM population method used herein describes all concentration-time curves by a single three-compartment model, considering biphasic kinetics as fragmentary data. Residual intraindividual variability was 21.4%. Population mean values (+/- interindividual SD) of clearance, terminal half-life, and total volume of distribution were, respectively, 23.40 (+/- 10.76) L/h, 46.87 (+/- 12.18) h, and 385.49 (+/- 196.60) L.

This receptor complex plays a critical role in leukocyte chemotaxis, adherence to vascular endothelium, and phagocytosis. We investigated expression of the CD11b subunit of this adherence receptor complex in various leukocyte populations. As previously described for the CD18 subunit, enhanced CD11b surface antigen and mRNA expression are present in peripheral blood granulocytes, as well as in chemically induced, differentiating HL-60 cells. However, in contrast to CD18 mRNA expression, which is transcriptionally regulated in differentiating HL-60 cells, the steady state levels of CD11b mRNA appear to be post-transcriptionally regulated in these cells. Thus, although the steady state levels of mRNA for the individual subunits of the CD11b/CD18 adherence receptor complex generally parallel each other during human myeloid differentiation, the mechanisms responsible for regulating these levels are distinctly different.","['Hickstein, D D', 'Back, A L', 'Collins, S J']","['Hickstein DD', 'Back AL', 'Collins SJ']","['Medical Research Division, Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center, Washington 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Leukocyte-Adhesion/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/physiology']",1989/12/25 00:00,1989/12/25 00:01,['1989/12/25 00:00'],"['1989/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 25;264(36):21812-7.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(20)88256-8 [pii]'],['CA 40728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms by which purine analogs induce differentiation offer unique potential for cancer chemotherapy. The guanine analogs, 6-thioguanine and 8-azaguanine, induce granulocytic differentiation of HGPRT-deficient HL-60 promyelocytes. Although these compounds are useful as model purine analogs that induce differentiation in HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells, they suffer the disadvantage that they are highly cytotoxic to wild-type cells. We studied the effect of the hypoxanthine analog 6-ethylmercaptopurine on wild-type and HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells. 6-Ethylmercaptopurine inhibits growth and produces a specific terminal end-cell in both types of HL-60 cells. The mechanism appears to be independent of the normal modes of cytotoxic activation through HGPRT or adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), since no new peaks were seen in HPLC chromatograms of the nucleotide pools. Furthermore, hypoxanthine and adenine failed to prevent growth inhibition by 6-ethylmercaptopurine, and inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase and the consequential alteration of the guanine nucleotide pools does not appear to be involved. The mechanism differs from that of guanine analog-induced differentiation in HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells.","['Gibboney, D S', 'French, B T', 'Patrick, D E', 'Trewyn, R W']","['Gibboney DS', 'French BT', 'Patrick DE', 'Trewyn RW']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '5417-84-5 (6-ethylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Hypoxanthines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;25(3):189-94. doi: 10.1007/BF00689581.,0344-5704 (Print) 0344-5704 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00689581 [doi]'],['P30-CA-16058-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Among its other properties, AD 198 produces a delayed but profound effect on cell-cycle progression and a pattern of continuing DNA damage in cultured cells briefly exposed to the drug. Using radiolabeled drug forms and radioassays combined with HPLC separation and fluorimetric detection techniques, aspects of drug accumulation, biotransformation, and retention in cultured human CEM leukemic lymphocytes were studied, in part to determine a possible pharmacologic basis for the latent effects seen with this drug. In addition, the cellular pharmacology of AD 198 and ADR were comparatively examined under identical experimental conditions. When CEM cells were incubated with drug at equi-growth inhibitory/minimally cytotoxic concentrations (AD 198, 1.0 microM; ADR, 0.1 microM), a number of differences were apparent. Under conditions of continuous 24-h drug exposure, a slow cellular accumulation and equilibration was observed with ADR (cell: medium equilibrium, 1:11 after 4-6 h), whereas the uptake of AD 198 was rapid and extensive (cell: medium equilibrium, 3:1 within 30 min). In drug-retention studies, when cells were pretreated at the same drug concentrations as before (AD 198 for 1 h; ADR for 4 h) and then transferred to drug-free media, both compounds re-equilibrated their intracellular drug content with the fresh media, losing about 50% of their respective anthracycline levels. Liquid chromatographic analysis of ADR-treated cultures under both sets of conditions showed the parent drug to be the only intracellular anthracycline species, whereas analysis of AD 198-treated cultures revealed two fluorescent signals corresponding to the parent drug and its 14-de-esterified biotransformation product, N-benzyladriamycin (AD 288). Levels of AD 288 rose from 2% of the total intracellular anthracycline content immediately on drug admixture to 61% following 24 h continuous drug exposure and to 69% at 24 h in cells exposed to drug for 1 h and then continued in drug-free media for 24 h. At all times, the balance of the intracellular anthracycline fluorescence was attributable to the parent drug; no ADR was detectable in AD 198-treated cells by either fluorescence detection or radioassay.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Israel, M', 'Sweatman, T W', 'Seshadri, R', 'Koseki, Y']","['Israel M', 'Sweatman TW', 'Seshadri R', 'Koseki Y']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38163.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '98983-21-2 (N-benzyladriamycin-14-valerate)']",IM,"['Biotransformation', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line/analysis/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Doxorubicin/*analogs & derivatives/analysis/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Scintillation Counting', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1989;25(3):177-83. doi: 10.1007/BF00689579.,0344-5704 (Print) 0344-5704 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00689579 [doi]'],"['CA 37082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

However, recent studies in mice have shown that PCPZ protects against renal injury produced by treatment with various nephrotoxicants (e.g., MethylCCNU, mercuric chloride). Because renal toxicity remains a serious limitation to the effective use of CDDP, we conducted the present study to determine whether PCPZ could also protect against CDDP-induced renal injury. PCPZ treatment was shown to ameliorate CDDP-induced renal lesions in both rats and mice at doses and treatment schedules that were comparable with those used for alleviating chemotherapy-induced emesis. A PCPZ dose of 10 mg/kg x 2 offered complete protection against CDDP-induced increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in mice, with significant protection occurring at a PCPZ dose as low as 5 mg/kg. Similarly, PCPZ ameliorated CDDP-induced increases in BUN, glucosouria, and enzymuria in F344 rats. PCPZ treatment did not affect the urinary excretion or renal tissue levels of total platinum or the plasma pharmacokinetics of free platinum. However, it did cause a marked reduction in the concentration of total plasma platinum (free platinum + protein-bound platinum).

Differentiation of these cells is always accompanied by withdrawal from the cell cycle. Here we describe the isolation of a cDNA encoding a novel serine protease that is present in HL-60 cells and is down-regulated during induced differentiation of these cells. We have named this protease myeloblastin. Down-regulation of myeloblastin mRNA occurs with both monocytic and granulocytic inducers. Myeloblastin mRNA is undetectable in fully differentiated HL-60 cells as well as in human peripheral blood monocytes. We found that regulation of myeloblastin mRNA in HL-60 cells is serum dependent.

A second chiral center occurs at C-4 of the 4-fluoroglutamate used to synthesize FMTX and, as a consequence, FMTX occurs as both D,L-erythro and D,L-threo diastereomers. The interaction of both diastereomers with intracellular dihydrofolate reductase has been examined in the human leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM, using a centrifugal column technique. Measurements of the rate at which radiolabel was displaced from [3H]MTX-saturated dihydrofolate reductase following suspension of the cells in unlabeled drug indicated that MTX and the erythro isomer of FMTX gave essentially the same rate of displacement; the rate of displacement by the threo isomer of FMTX was slower, but the interpretation of these data was ambiguous since the rate of transport of threo-FMTX may have been limiting. In reciprocal experiments in which dihydrofolate reductase was saturated with [3H]erythro-FMTX, the erythro isomer and MTX again behaved equivalently in terms of displacement. When dihydrofolate reductase was saturated with [3H]threo-FMTX, the radiolabel was clearly displaced at a much faster rate than either other radiolabel regardless of whether the displacing agent was MTX or the isomer. These results indicate a distinct stereospecificity for interaction of inhibitor with dihydrofolate reductase in which the threo isomer has a faster off-rate. Of the two FMTX diastereomers, the erythro isomer thus most closely mimics the properties of MTX.","['McGuire, J J', 'Haile, W H', 'Coward, J K']","['McGuire JJ', 'Haile WH', 'Coward JK']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (fluoresceinated methotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Dec 1;38(23):4321-5. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90532-7.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90532-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90532-7 [doi]']","['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study we used two zwitterionic rhodamine analogs, Rhodamine 116 and Rhodamine 110, and another positively-charged analog, Rhodamine 6G, to determine whether drug accumulation, resistance and modulation were affected by changes in the charge of these compounds. While there was no differential sensitivity between sensitive and resistant FLC to zwitterionic rhodamines, there was marked differential toxicity between these cell types for the positively-charged analogs. The IC50 values were 1000- and 100-fold greater in resistant than in sensitive cells for Rho 123 and Rho 6G respectively. Intracellular drug accumulation was significantly higher in sensitive as compared to resistant cells for both Rho 123 and Rho 6G, but little difference in drug uptake between these two cell types was observed for Rho 110 and Rho 116. It was also found that the intracellular to extracellular ratio of the positively-charged compounds was greater than unity in both sensitive and resistant cells whereas for the zwitterionic analogs this ratio was less than 1. Furthermore, this ratio of drug uptake was found to be significantly higher for Rho 6G than for Rho 123, which correlated with the high oil:water partition coefficient of Rho 6G (115.6). In MDR cells, verapamil increased Rho 123 and Rho 6G accumulation by 9.4- and 8.6-fold respectively. In addition, IC50 values in resistant cells were reduced greater than 100-fold for Rho 6G and greater than 1000-fold for Rho 123 in the presence of 10 micrograms/ml of verapamil. In contrast, less than 2-fold reduction of IC50 values for both of the zwitterionic analogs could be obtained under the same conditions. These results indicate that the chemical charge of rhodamines plays an important role in their differential accumulation, cytotoxicity and sensitivity to modulators such as verapamil, in sensitive and multi-drug resistant cells. The data also suggest that increased lipophilicity of the positively-charged rhodamines may increase their ability to accumulate in, and subsequently kill, MDR cells.","['Lampidis, T J', 'Castello, C', 'del Giglio, A', 'Pressman, B C', 'Viallet, P', 'Trevorrow, K W', 'Valet, G K', 'Tapiero, H', 'Savaraj, N']","['Lampidis TJ', 'Castello C', 'del Giglio A', 'Pressman BC', 'Viallet P', 'Trevorrow KW', 'Valet GK', 'Tapiero H', 'Savaraj N']","['Department of Oncology, Papanicolaou Comprehensive Cancer Center, Miami, FL.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Xanthenes)', '037VRW83CF (rhodamine 6G)', '13558-31-1 (rhodamine 110)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '62669-77-6 (rhodamine 116)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Xanthenes/*pharmacology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Dec 1;38(23):4267-71. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90525-x.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90525-X [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90525-x [doi]']",['NIH 37109/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

This induction was blocked by the addition of spermidine, spermine or putrescine simultaneously with MTPA. Inhibition by spermidine or spermine of the MTPA-induced ODC activity was larger than that by putrescine. The increase of ODC activity by MTPA led to the large increase of cellular putrescine content. This increase of putrescine content was abolished drastically by the simultaneous addition of spermidine or spermine. The increase of ODC activity was almost completely blocked by the addition of cycloheximide or actinomycin D. This finding suggested that the increase of ODC activity was not due to activation of ODC preformed in Molt 4B cells. The ODC induction by MTPA was dose-dependently blocked by adding the calcium channel blockers (verapamil and nifedipine) or protein kinase C inhibitors (1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine and palmitoyl carnithine). These results suggested that calcium and protein kinase C (PKC) were involved in MTPA-associated induction of ODC.","['Hibasami, H', 'Maekawa, S', 'Murata, T', 'Nakashima, K']","['Hibasami H', 'Maekawa S', 'Murata T', 'Nakashima K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Propylamines)', '4104-45-4 (3-methylthiopropylamine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Nifedipine/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*metabolism', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase Inhibitors', 'Polyamines/*pharmacology', 'Propylamines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Nov 1;38(21):3673-6. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90571-6.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90571-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90571-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Each child received the drug once daily for up to 3 years and was studied repeatedly (1-12 times). An HPLC method was used for drug analysis. We found large interpatient variations in the mean peak plasma concentration (range of 50-424 ng/ml) and in the mean area under the concentration vs. time from 0-4 h curve (range of 82-637 ng ml-1 h). There were also pronounced variations between different sampling occasions in the same patient. Nine of the 22 patients had complications during the maintenance therapy. Five children with a mean peak plasma level below 135 ng/ml and a mean area under the curve (AUC) value below 251 ng ml-1 h relapsed (three in the central nervous system and two in the bone marrow). Both children with a bone marrow relapse died. Relapse risk was related to the AUC (p less than 0.05). Four children with a mean peak plasma level above 166 ng/ml and a mean AUC value above 363 ng/ml/h developed severe myelotoxicity, which necessitated a temporary cessation of the maintenance therapy. In addition, two patient relapsed 6 and 11 months after termination of maintenance therapy. Their mean peak and AUC values were not low but the concentrations decreased markedly towards the end of the maintenance period. The results indicate that the plasma levels of 6-mercaptopurine, when determined repeatedly, might be of significance for the outcome of the remission maintenance treatment.","['Hayder, S', 'Lafolie, P', 'Bjork, O', 'Peterson, C']","['Hayder S', 'Lafolie P', 'Bjork O', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Pediatric, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/*blood/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 1989 Nov;11(6):617-22. doi: 10.1097/00007691-198911000-00001.,0163-4356 (Print) 0163-4356 (Linking),,['10.1097/00007691-198911000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

2595451,NLM,MEDLINE,19900125,20191022,15,6,1989 Nov,A fine-structure deletion map of human chromosome 11p: analysis of J1 series hybrids.,477-501,"Deletion analysis offers a powerful alternative to linkage and karyotypic approaches for human chromosome mapping. A panel of deletion hybrids has been derived by mutagenizing J1, a hamster cell line that stably retains chromosome 11 as its only human DNA, and selecting for loss of MIC1, a surface antigen encoded by a gene in band 11p13. A unique, self-consistent map was constructed by analyzing the pattern of marker segregation in 22 derivative cells lines; these carry overlapping deletions of 11p13, but selectively retain a segment near the 11p telomere. The map orders 35 breakpoints and 36 genetic markers, including 3 antigens, 2 isozymes, 12 cloned genes, and 19 anonymous DNA probes. The deletions span the entire short arm, dividing it into more than 20 segments and define a set of reagents that can be used to rapidly locate any newly identified marker on 11p, with greatest resolution in the region surrounding MIC1. The approach we demonstrate can be applied to map any mammalian chromosome. To test the gene order, we examined somatic cell hybrids from five patients, whose reciprocal translocations bisect band 11p13; these include two translocations associated with familial aniridia and two with acute T-cell leukemia. In each patient, the markers segregate in telomeric and centromeric groups as predicted by the deletion map. These data locate the aniridia gene (AN2) and a recurrent T-cell leukemia breakpoint (TCL2) in the marker sequence, on opposite sides of MIC1. To provide additional support, we have characterized the dosage of DNA markers in a patient with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and an 11p15-11pter duplication. Our findings suggest the following gene order: TEL - (HRAS1, MER2, CTSD, TH/INS/IGF2, H19, D11S32) - (RRM1, D11S1, D11S25, D11S26) - D11S12 - (HBBC, D11S30) - D11S20 - (PTH, CALC) - (LDHA, SAA, TRPH, D11S18, D11S21) - D11S31 - D11S17 - HBVS1 - (FSHB, D11S16) - AN2 - MIC1 - TCL2 - delta J - CAT - MIC4 - D11S9 - D11S14 - ACP2 - (D11S33, 14L) - CEN. We have used the deletion map to show the distribution on 11p of two centromeric repetitive elements and the low-order interspersed repeat A36Fc. Finally, we provide evidence for an allelic segregation event in the hamster genome that underlies the stability of chromosome 11 in J1. The deletion map provides a basis to position hereditary disease loci on 11p, to distinguish the pattern of recessive mutations in different forms of cancer and, since many of these genes have been mapped in other mammalian species, to study the evolution of a conserved syntenic group.","['Glaser, T', 'Housman, D', 'Lewis, W H', 'Gerhard, D', 'Jones, C']","['Glaser T', 'Housman D', 'Lewis WH', 'Gerhard D', 'Jones C']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Somat Cell Mol Genet,Somatic cell and molecular genetics,8403568,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aniridia/genetics', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome/genetics', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Library', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics', 'Multigene Family', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Somat Cell Mol Genet. 1989 Nov;15(6):477-501. doi: 10.1007/BF01534910.,0740-7750 (Print) 0740-7750 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF01534910 [doi]'],"['T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2T 32 GMO7753-56/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM27882/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

By contrast, hemopoietic malignancies have consistently proved difficult to transplant and well-characterized human leukemias suitable for studies in nude mice are scarce. We report here our experience with subcutaneous xenotransplantation of human neoplastic cells into nu/nu mice immunosuppressed through sublethal irradiation and splenectomy (SI-nu/nu) and with an additional injection of anti-Asialo-GM1 antibodies (SIA-nu/nu) in order to eliminate natural killer activity. Thirteen out of 16 continuous cell lines established in vitro from solid tumors and 7 out of 14 human tumors obtained from fragments of surgical specimens formed a progressively growing tumor in SI-nu/nu mice. Six out of 8 in vitro established human leukemic cell lines and 5 out of 18 neoplastic hematopoietic cells directly xenotransplanted from the patient grew SIA-nu/nu mice. When the membrane and chromosome markers of neoplastic cells that grew into the mice were evaluated, only marginal differences with those of the original tumors were found. In addition, when interfering factors alter the histological aspect of the primary tumor, xenotransplantation may also be of some help in histological diagnosis. By using SI- and SIA-nu/nu mice, it is thus possible to build up several new in vivo experimental systems with fresh human tumors that may be of value in studying the efficacy of differentiation factors and immunological maneuvers on the in vivo growth of human tumors.","['Caretto, P', 'Forni, M', ""d'Orazi, G"", 'Scarpa, S', 'Feraiorni, P', 'Jemma, C', 'Modesti, A', 'Ferrarini, M', 'Roncella, S', 'Foa, R']","['Caretto P', 'Forni M', ""d'Orazi G"", 'Scarpa S', 'Feraiorni P', 'Jemma C', 'Modesti A', 'Ferrarini M', 'Roncella S', 'Foa R', 'et al.']","['Istituto di Microbiologia, Universita degli Studi di Torino.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Ric Clin Lab,La Ricerca in clinica e in laboratorio,7613947,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*pathology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ric Clin Lab. 1989 Jul-Sep;19(3):231-43. doi: 10.1007/BF02871812.,0390-5748 (Print) 0390-5748 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02871812 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The control group consisted of 68 subjects aged 56.8 +/- 14 years, 35 women and 33 men, showing no diseases affecting the blood lipid disturbances. The following determinations have been performed in the blood serum: apo B, CH, TG, PL, and CH or PL in the isolated HDL fraction; LDL-CH ratio has also been calculated. In patients with CLL the total CH concentration has been noted which advanced parallel to the disease progress. It resulted first of all from the decrease in LDL-CH (p less than 0.05). Similar alterations have been noted so far as apo B is concerned. It has been demonstrated that the decrease in HDL-CH (p less than 0.05) is also dependent on the disease stage. The simultaneously increasing index HDL-PL/HDL-CH indicate on changes within the HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions suggesting a deficiency of the HDL2 subfraction. The total lipemia and the lipoprotein fraction alterations observed make the diagnostic value of the atherosclerotic threat in patients with CLL doubtful with the use of that parameters.","['Lorenc, J', 'Kozak-Michalowska, I', 'Polkowska-Kulesza, E']","['Lorenc J', 'Kozak-Michalowska I', 'Polkowska-Kulesza E']",,['pol'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,"['0 (Apolipoproteins B)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Lipoproteins, HDL)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Apolipoproteins B/blood', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperlipidemias/*diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Lipids/*blood', 'Lipoproteins, HDL/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Triglycerides/blood']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Przegl Lek. 1989;46(10):713-8.,0033-2240 (Print) 0033-2240 (Linking),Zaburzenia metabolizmu lipidow i lipoprotein u chorych z przewlekla bialaczka limfatyczna.

Upon screening the recombinant library, 75 cDNA clones hybridized specifically with cDNA probes from induced K562 cells and hybridized only slightly or not at all with cDNA probes from uninduced K562 cells and HL-60 cells, or from globin genes. Forty-five of the cDNA clones were full length complements to the corresponding RNA. To screen for trans-acting factors which can activate globin gene expression, the cDNA clones were inserted into a eukaryotic expression vector and co-transfected into HeLa cells with another vector containing the epsilon globin promoter 5' to the bacterial CAT (chloramphenicol acetyl transferase) reporter gene. Partial screening of the 45 full length clones revealed one cDNA (clone #17) that was able to increase CAT activity (driven by the epsilon-globin promoter) by about 2.5 times.

Eleven episodes occurred at two specific treatment points. Septic episodes were complicated by shock (2 of 15), encephalopathy (2 of 15), pneumonia (3 of 15) and death (1 of 15).

Here we describe how the proviral insertion in the Spi-1 domain is associated with the enhanced transcription of a 1.4 kb mRNA normally expressed at a low level in normal cells. The gene is localized on murine chromosome 2, band E3. The structure of the Spi-1 gene was determined by sequencing genomic and cDNA clones. The gene has an open reading frame encoding a protein of 218 amino acids, extending over five exons. Proviruses always integrate outside, upstream and in the opposite orientation of the protein-encoding domain. This suggests that SFFV integration activates the expression of Spi-2 gene that may contribute to the erythroleukemic process.","['Moreau-Gachelin, F', 'Ray, D', 'Mattei, M G', 'Tambourin, P', 'Tavitian, A']","['Moreau-Gachelin F', 'Ray D', 'Mattei MG', 'Tambourin P', 'Tavitian A']","['INSERM U-248, Faculte de Medecine Lariboisiere Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (v-Spi-1 protein, Friend spleen focus-forming virus)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', '*Chromosome Mapping', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Genomic Library', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transcriptional Activation']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1989 Dec;4(12):1449-56.,0950-9232 (Print) 0950-9232 (Linking),,,,,['Oncogene 1990 Jun;5(6):941'],,,,,,,

No difference was observed in the frequency of reactivation of latent herpes simplex virus infection between different graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis regimens. Reactivation was more frequent in patients conditioned with total body irradiation than in patients conditioned without total body irradiation. Antiviral prophylaxis, with subsequent decreased frequency of oral herpes simplex reactivation, appeared to contribute to a low frequency of septicemia with alpha streptococci.","['Heimdahl, A', 'Mattsson, T', 'Dahllof, G', 'Lonnquist, B', 'Ringden, O']","['Heimdahl A', 'Mattsson T', 'Dahllof G', 'Lonnquist B', 'Ringden O']","['Department of Oral Surgery, Pedodontics, Huddinge University Hospital.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology",0376406,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*complications/prevention & control', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Candidiasis, Oral/complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Herpes Simplex/complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Diseases/*complications/prevention & control', 'Sepsis/complications']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol. 1989 Dec;68(6):711-6. doi: 10.1016/0030-4220(89)90160-6.,0030-4220 (Print) 0030-4220 (Linking),,['10.1016/0030-4220(89)90160-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic factors were well balanced in the two groups. Combined therapy produced considerable toxicity: 12 patients required hospitalization for fever and transient neutropenia, 5 had congestive heart failure, and 2 were later found to have acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Patients receiving combined therapy had a significantly higher rate of complete response, documented by biopsy, than patients receiving conservative therapy (38 percent vs. 18 percent; P = 0.032).

In the present study, we investigated the metabolism of FK973 in the blood of human and animals and the antitumor effects of its metabolites. After the incubation of FK973 in the blood (hemolysate) or serum of humans, dogs, rats and mice, it was rapidly metabolized to two diacetates and a monoacetate, and slowly to FR900482. FK973 and all its deacetylated metabolites showed strong cytotoxicity on in vitro cultured murine L1210 leukemia cells, and the cytotoxicity of FK973 was the most potent. In the vivo experiments, FK973 and its metabolites prolonged the life of mice bearing ascitic P388 leukemia, and it potently inhibited the growth of murine B16 melanoma and Colon 38 adenocarcinoma implanted subcutaneously in mice. FK973 was the most effective compound. Thus, these results suggest that the antitumor effects of FK973 are stronger than those of its deacetylated metabolites produced in the blood of humans and animals.","['Masuda, K', 'Suzuki, A', 'Nakamura, T', 'Takagaki, S', 'Noda, K', 'Shimomura, K', 'Noguchi, H', 'Shibayama, F']","['Masuda K', 'Suzuki A', 'Nakamura T', 'Takagaki S', 'Noda K', 'Shimomura K', 'Noguchi H', 'Shibayama F']","['Product Development Laboratories, Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Pharmacol,Japanese journal of pharmacology,2983305R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Oxazines)', '114580-45-9 (FK 973)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*blood/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Dealkylation', 'Dogs', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oxazines/*blood/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Pharmacol. 1989 Oct;51(2):219-26. doi: 10.1254/jjp.51.219.,0021-5198 (Print) 0021-5198 (Linking),,['10.1254/jjp.51.219 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms of the destructive action of three sclerosants (ethanolamine oleate [EO], Aethoxysklerol [AS] & absolute ethanol [Et]) on endothelial cells of varices were studied by means of observation of morphological change of the cells and 51Cr release from the cells in a contact with these sclerosants using cultured human endothelial cells and culture cell line K-562 as target cells. Main mechanism for destructive action of EO on the endothelial cells was considered to be cytolysis through injury of cell membrane, since the cells disappeared immediately after addition of EO with marked release of 51Cr. The destructive action of AS on endothelial cells was considered to be mild cytolysis, since moderate destruction of the cells and moderate release of 51Cr were induced with AS. On the other hand, Et showed a fixative-destructive action on the cells without marked morphological change and with little release of 51Cr. Therefore, it was considered that EO and AS caused the damage of endothelial cells through their lytic action of the cell membrane, whereas Et caused it through the fixative action of the cell membrane.","['Orikasa, K']",['Orikasa K'],,['jpn'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai zasshi = The Japanese journal of gastro-enterology,2984683R,"['0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Sclerosing Solutions)', '0AWH8BFG9A (Polidocanol)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', 'U4RY8MRX7C (ethanolamine oleate)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*drug effects/pathology', 'Esophageal and Gastric Varices/*therapy', 'Ethanol/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Oleic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Polidocanol', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Sclerosing Solutions/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai Zasshi. 1989 Oct;86(10):2365-72.,0446-6586 (Print) 0446-6586 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

A 33-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of fever and chest pain. On physical examination, hepatosplenomegaly was not noticed. Pancytopenia and a small number of blast cells were observed in the peripheral blood. Poikilocytosis was not detected. Bone marrow examination revealed dry tap on aspiration, and moderate increase in reticulin fiber on biopsy. The diagnosis of AMF was made. Eight months later, blast cells markedly increased. Surface marker was investigated and MCS-2 (CD13), C17 (CDw41) and P2 (CDw41) were found to be positive. Electron microscopic examination revealed that blast cells were composed of PPO-positive cells and MPO-positive cells.

The amount of megakaryocytes was graded into four groups; marked hypoplasia (O), moderate hypoplasia (L), normoplasia (N) and hyperplasia (H), RA cases showed heterogeneous pattern; containing 14 cases (18.9%) of group (O), 18 cases (24.3%) of group (L), 31 cases (41.9%) of group (N) and 11 cases (14.9%) of group (H). RARS, RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML cases were classified into group (N) or group (H). The heterogeneous pattern of RA did not relate to leukemic change, but over all survival tended to be shorter in group (N) cases. A significant number of young female cases of RA were involved in group (O). Morphological abnormalities of MDS megakaryocytes were classified into five types; I, mononuclear micromegakaryocytes, II, binuclear micromegakaryocytes, III, mononuclear small megakaryocytes, IV, multiseparated-nuclear megakaryocytes and V, megakaryocytes with bizzare nuclei. RAEB and RAEB-T cases uniformly showed marked dysmegakaryopoiesis ranging from type I to V. whereas RA, RARS and CMML cases showed mild dysmegakaryopoiesis. Only five cases (6.4%) of RA cases had type I micromegakaryocytes. Eight RA cases with type I on diagnosis or obtaining it during the clinical course tended to develop acute myeloid leukemia (5 cases) or to transform to RAEB sooner or later. In two cases of RAEB in which hematological improvement was obtained with low dose cytosine arabinoside regimen, disappearance of type I micromegakaryocytes was noted. A female case with 5q-anomaly surviving more than 10 years showed marked megakaryocyte hyperplasia and almost exclusively type III and IV megakaryocytes. These findings indicated that pattern of dysmegakaryopoiesis, especially appearance of type I, was closely related to leukemic change in MDS. Thus quantitative and qualitative evaluations of MDS megakaryocytopoiesis seemed important to understand the further heterogeneity of pathophysiology in MDS subtypes.","['Tomonaga, M', 'Jinnai, I', 'Kuriyama, K', 'Nonaka, H', 'Amenomori, T', 'Matsuo, T', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Sasagawa, I', 'Sadamori, N', 'Ichimaru, M']","['Tomonaga M', 'Jinnai I', 'Kuriyama K', 'Nonaka H', 'Amenomori T', 'Matsuo T', 'Yoshida Y', 'Sasagawa I', 'Sadamori N', 'Ichimaru M', 'et al.']",,['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/*pathology/physiopathology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1989 Oct;30(10):1788-99.,0485-1439 (Print) 0485-1439 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We also studied the possibility that DL-buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis, can sensitize the cancer cells to these anticancer agents via depletion of intracellular GSH. It was found that BSO potentiated ACNU cytotoxicity against human leukemia K562 cells and DDP cytotoxicity against K562 and human colon cancer WiDr cells. It indicates that cancer cells with higher GSH level are more effectively sensitized by BSO regardless of degree of their intrinsic sensitivity to these anticancer agents.

2592896,NLM,MEDLINE,19900117,20190503,43,1,1989 Mar,On statistical methods for analysing the geographical distribution of cancer cases near nuclear installations.,79-85,"There is great public concern, often based on anecdotal reports, about risks from ionising radiation. Recent interest has been directed at an excess of leukaemia cases in the locality of civil nuclear installations at Sellafield and Sizewell, and epidemiologists have a duty to pursue such information vigorously. This paper sets out to show that the epidemiological methods most commonly used can be improved upon. When analysing geographical data it is necessary to consider location. The most obvious quantification of location is ranked distance, though other measures which may be more meaningful in relation to aetiology may be substituted. A test based on distance ranks, the ""Poisson maximum test"", depends on the maximum of observed relative risk in regions of increasing size, but with significance level adjusted for selection. Applying this test to data from Sellafield and Sizewell shows that the excess of leukaemia incidence observed at Seascale, near Sellafield, is not an artefact due to data selection by region, and that the excess probably results from a genuine, if as yet unidentified cause (there being little evidence of any other locational association once the Seascale cases have been removed). So far as Sizewell is concerned, geographical proximity to the nuclear power station does not seem particularly important.","['Bithell, J F', 'Stone, R A']","['Bithell JF', 'Stone RA']","['Department of Statistics, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Cluster Analysis', 'England/epidemiology', 'Geography', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Poisson Distribution', '*Statistics as Topic']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 1989 Mar;43(1):79-85. doi: 10.1136/jech.43.1.79.,0143-005X (Print) 0143-005X (Linking),,['10.1136/jech.43.1.79 [doi]'],,PMC1052795,,,,,,,,

Significant serum IL-6 levels were detected in only 3% of the MGUS/SMM group, but in 35% of the overt MM group and 100% of the PCL group. During overt MM, IL-6 was detected in 37% of the patients at diagnosis, 13% of those with stable MM, and 60% of those with fulminating disease. These data demonstrate that serum levels of IL-6, a potent myeloma cell growth factor in vitro, correlate with disease severity in plasma cell dyscrasias. Serial studies performed in 3 patients and correlative studies with labeling index in vivo in 25 patients have confirmed this concept. Taken together, this suggests that this cytokine is probably involved in vivo during the progressive phase of MM. Thus, anti-IL-6 or anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies could be useful as therapeutic agents at this stage of the disease.","['Bataille, R', 'Jourdan, M', 'Zhang, X G', 'Klein, B']","['Bataille R', 'Jourdan M', 'Zhang XG', 'Klein B']","['Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U291, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,['0 (Interleukin-6)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*blood', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood', 'Paraproteinemias/*blood', 'Prognosis']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Dec;84(6):2008-11. doi: 10.1172/JCI114392.,0021-9738 (Print) 0021-9738 (Linking),,['10.1172/JCI114392 [doi]'],,PMC304085,,,,,,,,

Both diastereomers of DDATHF were found to be potent inhibitors of leukemia cell growth due to effects on de novo purine synthesis. Cell growth inhibition by these compounds was prevented by 5-formyltetrahydrofolate in a dose-dependent manner. This indicated that the effects of the DDATHF diastereomers were due to inhibition of folate-dependent processes. Metabolite reversal experiments indicated that 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase was the major site of action of these compounds in mouse cells. Another site in de novo purine synthesis was affected at higher concentrations of diastereomer B in L1210 cells. Low concentrations of both diastereomers were found to inhibit pure L1210 5'-phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase competitively with the folate substrate. The two diastereomers were also efficient substrates for mouse liver folylpolyglutamate synthetase. We conclude that the 6R- and 6S-diastereomers of DDATHF are remarkably similar and equiactive antimetabolites inhibitory to de novo purine synthesis and that the biochemical processes involved in their cytotoxicity display little stereochemical specificity.","['Moran, R G', 'Baldwin, S W', 'Taylor, E C', 'Shih, C']","['Moran RG', 'Baldwin SW', 'Taylor EC', 'Shih C']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', '6P3AVY8A7Q (lometrexol)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.- (Acyltransferases)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Acyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Peptide Synthases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Purines/*metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolates/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/enzymology']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 15;264(35):21047-51.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(19)30043-2 [pii]'],['CA-42367/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The lesions also contain numerous T cells, predominantly of the CD4+ immunophenotype. To investigate whether the presence or absence of tissue eosinophilia is related to the immunophenotype of the T cells, we studied 43 cases of HD (28 nodular sclerosing, ten mixed cellularity, and five unclassifiable) for the relative numbers of lymphocytes positive for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD25, CD38, T9, TQ1, HLA-DR, and beta F1, and for the number of eosinophils in tissue sections. By univariate and multivariate analysis, we determined that there was an inverse relationship between the number of eosinophils and the presence of TQ1+ (P less than .0005) and CD25+ (P less than .0005) lymphocytes. In addition, we observed that TQ1 stained the Reed-Sternberg cells in these lesions. We also determined that the T cells expressed HLA-DR more frequently in the nodular sclerosis subtype than in other subtypes of HD (P less than or equal to .0001).

There was no significant difference in latex phagocytosis and NBT reduction between cultures with and without ARA-C. HL60 cells were arrested in S-phase and clonogenic capacity persisted.

The results showed that malignant clone already exists in the bone marrow of patients with MDS. Eighteen cases of them have transformed into AML. The rates of transforming into AML in RAEB, RAEB-T and CMML were markedly higher than that in RA. The courses of MDS which transformed into AML from the various types were different. The transformation in RA was obviously longer than those in RAEB and RAEB-T. Two cases transformed into myelofibrosis. Diagnosis of CMML according to the FAB classification criteria revealed that it has two forms. One shows only increase of mature monocytes and it has no relation with the types of acute leukemia to be transformed. It is considered as a reactive monocytosis. The other form, in addition to increase of mature monocytes, also has increase of a few monoblasts and promonocytes. These are considered as true CMML and usually quickly developed into M4 or M5 which are related with monocytes.","['Jiang, Y L', 'Hou, Y H', 'Li, X R']","['Jiang YL', 'Hou YH', 'Li XR']",,['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi,Zhonghua nei ke za zhi,16210490R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/complications/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,"Zhonghua Nei Ke Za Zhi. 1989 Jul;28(7):413-7, 444.",0578-1426 (Print) 0578-1426 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

For each study period, a weighted mean of white cell counts (mWBC), absolute neutrophil counts (mANC), and serum aminotransferases (mAT) were calculated, using as weights the intervals from sampling until the next WBC, ANC, or AT determinations were done. In 17 patients who underwent at least six measurements of E-MTX during a period in which the MTX dose remained unchanged for up to 22-months, the median intraindividual coefficient of variation for E-MTX was 10% (range, 5%-22%). For each patient, a mean of all E-MTX values (mE-MTX) during a study period (range, 1-15 measurements; median, 3) was used as an index of the RBC accumulation of MTX at the prescribed dose of MTX. Among 42 patients receiving full-dose MTX (greater than 17.5 mg/m2), the mE-MTX ranged between 3.4 and 9.6 nmol hemoglobin (Hb) (interindividual coefficient of variation, 33%). The mE-MTX was significantly related to the MTX dose (r = 0.45, P = 0.00003). The mWBC and mANC were both significantly related to the mE-MTX (mWBC: r = -0.31, P = 0.004; mANC: r = -0.35, P = 0.02), but not to the dose of MTX (mWBC: r = -0.08, P = 0.25; mANC: r = -0.22, P = 0.08). Each of four patients with a persistent rise in AT above the upper normal limit (40 IU/l) and an mAT of greater than 80 IU/l had an mE-MTX of greater than 6.5 nmol/mmol Hb. Due to its low intraindividual variation, E-MTX may be useful for detecting persistent or intermittent failure of patient compliance.

On the basis of the redox parameters for the Pt(IV) and Pt(II) oxidation states in a chloride system, it has been suggested that Pt(IV) complexes will be reduced to Pt(II) complexes in a biological environment. To test this hypothesis, uptake and metabolism studies of [14C]-iproplatin were carried out in L1210 cells. The L1210 cells raised in DBA2/J mice were incubated in vitro with 50 and 100 microM [14C]-iproplatin at 37 degrees C in Hanks' balanced salt solution, and total uptake and radioactivity associated with acid-insoluble fractions were measured for up to 3 h. Under these conditions, the uptake of iproplatin was linear with time and increased with increasing concentrations of iproplatin in the medium. At all times measured, greater than 35% of radioactivity was associated with the acid-insoluble fraction, suggesting binding to macromolecules. The [14C]-labelled compounds in neutralized acid extracts of cells were separated by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

Twenty one CLL-positive clones that did not hybridize with placental mRNA were studied. These clones were significantly represented in the mRNA from leukemic leukocytes and were not represent in the mRNA from normal leukocytes. There was high level of expression of 7-2D gene in CLL and B lymphoma cells. RNA hybridizing with clone 7-3G was comparatively highly abundant in CCRF-CEM and EB virus transformed lymphoid cell, while clone 6-1E was highly represented in the mRNAs of Molt 3 and CCRF-CEM cells. The expression of three clones (6-1E, 7-3G and 9-5C) selected from a CLL cDNA library was studied by nucleic acid hybridization in human promyelocytic leukemia cell (HL-60) treated with chemical inducers of cell differentiation. The differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophage-like cells upon induction by 12-o-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) was accompanied by rapid induction of the expression of 6-1E and 7-3G genes. The levels of expression of the 9-5C gene were not altered during macrophage-monocytic or granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. The expression of the 6-1E and/or 7-3G gene was induced by TPA in four of 6 samples derived from patients who achieved complete remission, but not in any of the acute nonlymphocytic leukemia samples from patients who failed to achieve complete remission. These findings suggest that expression of the 6-1E and 7-3G genes is related to macrophage-monocytic differentiation and that alterations of these gene expressions in fresh leukemic cells after one hour of TPA treatment are of prognostic significance in predicting the response to treatment. The primary structure of a cDNA of a gene (6-1E) selectively expressed in CLL was determined. A computer search in the nucleotide sequence data bank did not identify this gene as any other gene.

Another emergency function of intravascular access is obtaining blood samples for blood gases, laboratory studies, and blood cultures. One of the drawbacks to using the intraosseous route as an alternative to IV access has been the persistent need to establish IV access to obtain blood samples. We obtained bone marrow samples from ten healthy anesthetized dogs and analyzed the usefulness of the samples in providing meaningful laboratory studies when compared with simultaneous arterial and venous samples for blood electrolytes, blood chemistries, blood gases, and hemoglobin. There was no significant difference (P greater than .10) in blood electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride, and carbon dioxide) drawn from the intraosseous, arterial, and venous sites. The blood chemistries (blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, albumin, calcium, phosphorous, uric acid, total bilirubin, and SGOT) also were not significantly different (P greater than .10). Significant differences were obtained for glucose comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .03), whereas intraosseous versus venous was only marginally significant (P = .06). Significant differences were also obtained for alkaline phosphatase when comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .03), whereas comparison with venous was only marginally significant (P = .06): lactate dehydrogenase differences were marginally significant when comparing intraosseous with arterial (P = .09) and venous (P = .06) blood.

2589399,NLM,MEDLINE,19900105,20191210,87,6,1989 Dec,The anemia of chronic disease: spectrum of associated diseases in a series of unselected hospitalized patients.,638-44,"PURPOSE: Previous studies of the anemia of chronic disease (ACD) have generally begun with patients afflicted with one of the classical underlying diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. The clinical spectrum of ACD has not been thoroughly examined. We hypothesized that many patients have an anemia with the characteristics of ACD but do not have one of the infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disorders usually associated with ACD. We therefore evaluated a series of consecutive, unselected, anemic patients admitted to a county hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients admitted to the medicine ward service of a county hospital were screened for anemia (hematocrit less than 40% in men, less than 37% in women). Additional laboratory data were collected on all anemic patients, except those with active gastrointestinal bleeding, hemolytic disease, or leukemia or multiple myeloma. The patients were divided into three groups on the basis of serum values indicating iron distribution: iron deficiency (serum ferritin less than 10 ng/mL), ACD (serum iron less than 60 micrograms/dL and serum ferritin more than 50 ng/mL), and all others (non-ACD). The hospital records of the patients in the latter two groups were reviewed and their diagnoses recorded. RESULTS: Seven patients with iron deficiency were not considered further. Ninety patients with ACD were compared with 75 patients with non-ACD. The anemia in ACD patients was more severe than most authors describe. The mean hematocrit was 31%, and 20% of patients had hematocrits below 25%. The anemia was usually normocytic (mean red cell volume [MCV] 86 fL), but 21% had an MCV less than 80 fL. The level of saturation of serum iron-binding capacity was quite low in ACD (mean 15%) and was normal in non-ACD (mean 31%). Renal insufficiency was common in both groups; serum creatinine values were more than 2 mg/dL in 31% of patients with ACD and 20% of non-ACD patients. Sixty percent of patients with ACD had a principal diagnosis that fell into the infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic categories commonly associated with ACD. Renal insufficiency was the major diagnosis in 16%, and the principal diagnosis in 24% was a disease not commonly considered to be associated with ACD. In non-ACD patients, the principal diagnosis was an infectious, inflammatory, or neoplastic disease in 55%, renal insufficiency in 9%, and another disease in 36%. CONCLUSIONS: When ACD was defined by the abnormalities of iron distribution, which are its most consistent and widely accepted characteristics, the spectrum of associated diseases was much broader than the traditional categories of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic disorders, and the overlap with non-ACD was large. Until the etiologic and pathogenetic mechanisms of ACD are better understood, a flexible and inclusive view of this disorder seems appropriate.","['Cash, J M', 'Sears, D A']","['Cash JM', 'Sears DA']","['Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood/*complications', 'Chronic Disease', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Female', 'Ferritins/blood', '*Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infections/blood/*complications', 'Inflammation/blood/*complications', 'Iron/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/blood/*complications', 'Prospective Studies']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Dec;87(6):638-44. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80396-1.,0002-9343 (Print) 0002-9343 (Linking),,"['S0002-9343(89)80396-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80396-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with nosocomial candidemia between August 1, 1981, and October 31, 1984, were included if they met strict selection criteria and did not have acute or chronic leukemia. For each case, one control was selected from among patients admitted during the same month/year and matched for hospital service and duration of hospitalization up to the first blood culture that grew Candida species. Logistic regression was used to obtain estimates of risk after simultaneously controlling for other variables. RESULTS: Candida albicans caused 24 of the 48 fungemias studied. The risk factors identified included the presence of a central line (odds ratio, 26.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 451.1); bladder catheter (13.0 1.3 to 131.4); two or more antibiotics (25.1, 2.1 to 318); azotemia (22.1, 2.2 to 223.2); transfer from another hospital (21.3, 1.7 to 274.5); diarrhea (10.2, 1.03 to 101.4); and candiduria (27.0, 1.7 to 423.5). A prior surgical procedure was associated with lowered risk (0.1, 0.01 to 0.9), suggesting perhaps that medical service patients are at higher risk than those on surgical services. Because total parenteral nutrition was always administered by means of a central line, it could not be shown to increase the risk over that conferred by a central line alone. CONCLUSIONS: This study has defined seven major risk factors for nosocomial candidemia. These findings should facilitate development of rational approaches to preventing infection and may assist clinicians in identifying those patients in whom this life-threatening complication is likely to occur.","['Bross, J', 'Talbot, G H', 'Maislin, G', 'Hurwitz, S', 'Strom, B L']","['Bross J', 'Talbot GH', 'Maislin G', 'Hurwitz S', 'Strom BL']","['Infectious Diseases Section, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Candidiasis/epidemiology/*etiology/urine', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Catheters, Indwelling/statistics & numerical data', 'Communicable Disease Control/statistics & numerical data', 'Creatinine/urine', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology/*etiology/urine', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Odds Ratio', 'Patient Transfer', 'Pennsylvania', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Dec;87(6):614-20. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80392-4.,0002-9343 (Print) 0002-9343 (Linking),,"['S0002-9343(89)80392-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80392-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The records of 142 adult patients from a consecutive series of 226 induction or consolidation/maintenance chemotherapy courses for AML or ALL between 1982 to 1986 were reviewed retrospectively. Data were analyzed to compare the infectious disease complications and antimicrobial usage for patients receiving identical chemotherapy for a specific phase of leukemia treatment. Evaluation for each chemotherapy course included assessments for the following: compliance with criteria for initiating antibiotics, incidence of infection that was documented by culture or clinical criteria, predictive value of surveillance cultures, incidence of superinfection, survival outcomes, antimicrobial usage, antibiotic-related adverse effects, and cost for antibiotics and diagnostic studies. RESULTS: Antimicrobials were employed in 190 (84%) of 226 chemotherapy courses. Broad-spectrum antibiotics were regularly begun within the first five days of admission and they were continued for an average of 3.5 weeks until the granulocyte count was greater than 1,000/microL after discontinuation of chemotherapy. There were no differences in the types of infection or outcomes among the patient groups. There was only a 37% rate of documented infections by culture or clinical signs among these patients during their entire hospital stay. Bacterial infections, especially those caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci in patients with Hickman catheters, accounted for 93% of the episodes. Viral and fungal infections accounted for 4% and 3% of documented cases, respectively, and occurred more than 10 days after the institution of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. A total of 922 different antimicrobials were employed in 190 courses (average 4.9 per course). The rationale for excessive usage and multiple changes was a persistent or intermittent fever, rather than documented infection(s). This practice led to usage of more broad-spectrum and expensive antibiotics. Further analyses indicate that the greater number of antibiotics employed correlated with apparent increased toxicity, especially renal and hepatic adverse reactions. These toxicities were associated with higher rates of fatal outcomes, i.e., 12 (39%) of 31 patients died with antibiotic-associated hepatic and/or renal insufficiency, compared with 12 (7.5%) of 159 patients who died without antibiotic-associated organ damage. CONCLUSION: Excessive antibiotic usage and multiple antibiotic changes among adult leukemic patients undergoing chemotherapy appear to increase the risks of adverse hepatic and renal effects and death. Furthermore, this practice leads to use of more broad-spectrum and expensive antibiotics...","[""O'Hanley, P"", 'Easaw, J', 'Rugo, H', 'Easaw, S']","[""O'Hanley P"", 'Easaw J', 'Rugo H', 'Easaw S']","['Department of Medicine, Stanford University, California 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/economics/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'California', 'Female', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Medication Systems, Hospital/economics', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/epidemiology/prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Management', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/prevention & control']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1989 Dec;87(6):605-13. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80391-2.,0002-9343 (Print) 0002-9343 (Linking),,"['S0002-9343(89)80391-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9343(89)80391-2 [doi]']",,,,['Am J Med. 1990 Nov;89(5):694-5.

This enhancement was dependent on the concentration of both IL-2 (0-1 U/ml) and 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3(0-10(-7)M). The addition of interleukin-1 (IL-1, 0-100 U/ml), did not enhance the expression of IL-2 receptor in these cells in the presence of IL-2. Moreover, 1 alpha, 25(OH)2D3 had the same effect on two cell lines, Kit225 (an IL-2 dependent cell line established from a patient with T cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia) and YT (an IL-2 independent natural killer (NK)-like cell line from a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia).

Human myeloid leukemic cells could be induced to differentiate in vitro into mature cells by various chemical inducers that lost their proliferating potencies. In spite of decrease of proliferation capacity, almost all these terminally differentiated myeloid leukemic cells invariably showed UV-induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) at low energy of UV irradiation (3-5J/m2). This indicated that the terminally differentiated myeloid leukemic cells are functionally quite different from mature granulocytes in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or in normal peripheral blood. In HL-60 cells, UV-survival was enhanced in the process of differentiation induced by 1.25% DMSO or 0.6 mM sodium n-butyrate. The degree of enhancement of UV-survival was correlated with the increased amount of UDS. The process of myeloid leukemic cell differentiation which is completed without loss of capacity performing repair DNA synthesis was one of the characteristics of the terminally differentiated myeloid leukemic cells induced by chemical inducers in vitro and this function may support the hypothesis that DNA breaking and rejoining are involved in a mechanism of cytodifferentiation.","['Nakamaki, T', 'Ajiri, T', 'Sakashita, A', 'Tomoyasu, S', 'Tsuruoka, N']","['Nakamaki T', 'Ajiri T', 'Sakashita A', 'Tomoyasu S', 'Tsuruoka N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai zasshi : journal of Japan Haematological Society,2984803R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/radiation effects', 'DNA Repair/*radiation effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nihon Ketsueki Gakkai Zasshi. 1989 Sep;52(6):977-87.,0001-5806 (Print) 0001-5806 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We also studied the effects of the 2 platinum compounds on the distribution and excretion of gentamicin (GENT), an antibiotic that is excreted solely by the kidneys. Rats treated intravenously with 2.85 mg/kg of DDP on days 1, 5 and 9 had significantly different plasma urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and creatinine clearance rates on day 16 than those given the same doses of TTP. The renal function of TTP-treated rats did not differ from that of controls or rats given only GENT. Twenty-four hours after a single GENT dose (given on day 15), DDP-treated rats had higher GENT concentrations in the plasma, liver and spleen than rats given GENT alone. TTP-treated rats had higher GENT levels only in the spleen. DDP-treated rats retained a higher percentage of the injected platinum in the renal cortex than those treated with TTP. Light microscopic examination of renal tissue showed necrotic cells and dilated tubules in the proximal tubules of DDP-treated rats while the kidneys of TTP-treated rats were largely indistinguishable from those of controls. Thus, our results indicate that the distribution of platinum in the kidneys differs between rats treated with TTP and those treated with DDP. This may partly explain the considerably lower nephrotoxicity of TTP.","['Engineer, M S', 'Brown, N S', 'Ho, D H', 'Newman, R A', 'Bulger, R E']","['Engineer MS', 'Brown NS', 'Ho DH', 'Newman RA', 'Bulger RE']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'SFK1SGY8V1 (ormaplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Gentamicins/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Kidney/analysis/*drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Kidney Function Tests', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects/pathology', 'Liver/analysis', 'Male', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Platinum/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Spleen/analysis']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1989 Dec 1;59(2):151-62. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(89)90053-x.,0300-483X (Print) 0300-483X (Linking),,"['0300-483X(89)90053-X [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(89)90053-x [doi]']","['CA34028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'KO4 CA01135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Frozen section immunohistochemistry in six cases showed monotypic immunoglobulin in four lymphomas, (including the plasmacytoma), an immunoglobulin-negative B cell phenotype in one lymphoma, and polytypic immunoglobulin in the case of polymorphic hyperplasia. One lymphoma showed a monotypic immunoglobulin-producing B cell population in one site and an immunoglobulin-negative B cell population in another site.

In contrast with the other BCR-related genes studied to date, ABR represents a functionally active gene and contains exons very similar to those found within the Mbcr. Unlike the BCR gene, the ABR gene exhibits great genomic variability caused by two different variable tandem repeat regions located in two introns.

H-2-. It was found that highly immunogenic H-2+ YAC-1 was less tumorigenic than A. H-2- in untreated as well as NK-depleted syngeneic mice. The variant cells were not rejected even if inoculated together with YAC-1 cells into the brain. Furthermore, in T cell-depleted, thymectomized mice YAC-1 was as tumorigenic as A. H-2-. Thus, intracerebral natural resistance was expressed against YAC-1, suggesting that T cells but not NK cells might be involved in the tumor rejection with an MHC-restricted regulation. Contrary to this, A. H-2- cells escaped from the natural resistance of the brain. In vitro cytotoxicity assays showed that in relation to the enhancement of cell surface H-2 antigens, intracerebrally passaged YAC-1 cells decreased and increased the sensitivity to NK- and CTL-mediated lysis, respectively. In contrast, A. H-2- did not alter either susceptibility to cell-mediated lysis or cell surface H-2 expression. In vivo rapid elimination assays revealed that after intravenous or subcutaneous inoculation there was a more efficient abrogation of 125I-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) labelled YAC-1 cells in normal untreated mice compared to NK-depleted mice. After intracerebral inoculation, however, no difference in remaining radioactivity was observed between untreated and NK-depleted mice. This indicates that selective NK-mediated elimination of tumor cells might occur after intravenous or subcutaneous but not after intracerebral inoculation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Yamasaki, T', 'Kikuchi, H', 'Yamashita, J', 'Ljunggren, H G', 'Karre, K', 'Klein, G']","['Yamasaki T', 'Kikuchi H', 'Yamashita J', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Karre K', 'Klein G']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Kyoto University Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,No Shinkei Geka,No shinkei geka.

Transcripts which initiate in the 5' flanking promoter region are likely indicators of promoter accessibility and were therefore characterized during the time course of induction with each inducer in Friend Erythroleukemia cells. S1 analysis with probes labeled at - 12 or +82 relative to the (+1) cap site showed no major differences between 5' ends of the upstream initiated transcripts in cells induced by DMSO or HMBA. We detected several upstream bands with each inducer corresponding to beta-globin transcripts with 5' ends between - 190 and -55 relative to the cap site and found that cells induced with DMSO and HMBA show a similar transcription response as measured by initiation in the 5' flanking region of the beta-globin gene. Interestingly, the upstream initiated transcripts reach their peak concentration levels much earlier in the time course of induction than do the mRNA transcripts with 5' ends at the major (+1) cap site. Northern blot analysis detected the upstream initiated transcripts as early as 16 hours after induction with DMSO, primarily in unprocessed large transcripts.

The apparent excess of keloid formation indicates overreaction to mild injury, with no known relevance to neoplasia but of potential interest in future studies of scar formation.","['Siraganian, P A', 'Rubinstein, J H', 'Miller, R W']","['Siraganian PA', 'Rubinstein JH', 'Miller RW']","['Clinical Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Keloid/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome/*complications']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1989;17(6):485-91. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950170526.,0098-1532 (Print) 0098-1532 (Linking),,['10.1002/mpo.2950170526 [doi]'],"['07DD0269/07/DD/NCBDD CDC HHS/United States', 'MCJ-000-912-23-0/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This cohort was diagnosed between 1955 and 1979 at one of the institutions of the Late Effects Study Group. Solid tumors, non-lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) developed in 18, 17, and 3 patients, respectively. The estimated cumulative probability of developing any SMN was 2% at 5 years from diagnosis, 5% at 10 years, and 9% at 15 years. The incidence is ninefold greater than the risk of acquiring cancer in 19 year-olds, the median age at which the diagnosis of SMN was made in this study population. For leukemia and NHL the corresponding probabilities were 1%, 3%, and 4% for the group as a whole but were increased (2%, 6%, and 8%) in patients who had suffered one or more recurrences. In order to analyze the risk of leukemia and NHL associated with alkylating agent chemotherapy, each patient was assigned a score of one for each alkylating agent administered for a 6-month period. Scores of 2, 4, 6, and 8 were associated with probabilities of leukemia or NHL of 2%, 3%, 6%, and 10%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis for leukemia/lymphoma that included AAD score, stage, and splenectomy, the effect of AAD score and splenectomy did not change substantially compared to the univariate results. AAD score remained statistically significant (P = .0001), and splenectomy was of borderline significance (P = .09). Of the 18 solid tumor SMNs, 15 developed within the field of radiation, and one other developed in tissue irradiated 34 years earlier for hemangioma. This study of a large and unselected group of children with Hodgkin's disease who received a variety of therapies demonstrates that children are as likely as adults to develop acute leukemia after alkylating agents and solid tumors in the field of radiation therapy.","['Meadows, A T', 'Obringer, A C', 'Marrero, O', 'Oberlin, O', 'Robison, L', 'Fossati-Bellani, F', 'Green, D', 'Voute, P A', 'Morris-Jones, P', 'Greenberg, M']","['Meadows AT', 'Obringer AC', 'Marrero O', 'Oberlin O', 'Robison L', 'Fossati-Bellani F', 'Green D', 'Voute PA', 'Morris-Jones P', 'Greenberg M', 'et al.']","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary', 'Probability', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Splenectomy/*adverse effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1989;17(6):477-84.,0098-1532 (Print) 0098-1532 (Linking),,,['CA 14489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

There was an eightfold variability in area-under-concentration time-curve (AUC) of MTX achieved by the same dose. Excellent correlation existed between peak concentrations and AUC0----infinity (r = 0.95, P less than 0.001). Elimination T1/2 was between 1.34 and 5 hours (mean 2.16 +/- 0.23 hr, mean +/- SE). A weak correlation existed between AUC achieved by 1 mg/m2 MTX and patients' age or body weight. Weak but significant correlation existed between AUC achieved by 1 mg/m2 of MTX vs. 6MP (r = 0.54, P less than 0.05). In 13/16 patients peak concentrations were achieved at 60 minutes. There was a significantly larger AUC of 6MP achieved by a standardized dose in longer therapy (greater than 15 mo) vs. short therapy (less than 12 mo) (462 +/- 75 and 246 +/- 58 ng.ml-1.min.mg-1.m2, P less than 0.025). No statistical differences in AUC of MTX were found between short and long therapy. The large interpatient variability in MTX pharmacokinetics supports the possibility that differences in absorption and/or clearance of the drug may affect the clinical response. Because of the excellent correlation between peak and AUC of MTX, and because 3 measurements, at 30, 60, and 90 minutes will almost invariably identify the peak, this measurement can be used to estimate AUC for purpose of correlation with clinical outcome.","['Koren, G', 'Solh, H', 'Klein, J', 'Soldin, S J', 'Greenberg, M']","['Koren G', 'Solh H', 'Klein J', 'Soldin SJ', 'Greenberg M']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacokinetics', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacokinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1989;17(6):450-4. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950170520.,0098-1532 (Print) 0098-1532 (Linking),,['10.1002/mpo.2950170520 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

At a broad geographic level the county of Cumbria is shown to display the highest rates of ALL in all ages both in the 3 years of formal analyses (1984-1986) and in the 2 recent years. The administrative districts of Copeland, Sedgemoor, and North Devon also show excesses in all ages with Copeland having the highest SRR and level of statistical significance. This is a new observation for Copeland, the district containing the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing facility in that the high rates are for all ages of ALL. These new data were not considered in earlier official reports about that area.

The origin of an extra copy of chromosome 12 in lymphocytes from patients with B-CLL was studied by the use of probes detecting restriction fragment length polymorphisms on this chromosome. In all six patients that were evaluable, the third copy was derived from a simple duplication of one of the original chromosomes. In none of these patients nor in four patients with two copies of chromosome 12 were losses of the homologue observed. When studying metaphase cells from some CLL patients with trisomy 12, a large proportion of the cells are found to have a normal karyotype. In this study the fraction of normal metaphases was not matched by a similar fraction of cells lacking trisomy 12, as judged by scanning densitometry of hybridization bands.

This is discussed in relation to the immunogenicity of the leukemic cells and their capacity to differentiate.","['Aguilar-Santelises, M', 'Amador, J F', 'Mellstedt, H', 'Jondal, M']","['Aguilar-Santelises M', 'Amador JF', 'Mellstedt H', 'Jondal M']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(10):937-42. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90048-9.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90048-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

By sending a questionnaire form to major medical institutions throughout the country, data of 2202 5-year or longer survivors of acute leukemia was obtained as of 30 June 1988. There were 1607 children and 595 adults. In order to investigate the data further, they were divided into four periods according to the year of diagnosis: before 1969, 1970-1974, 1975-1979 and 1980-April 1983. As regards remission induction regimens, vincristine plus prednisolone (VP) was the most popular in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) throughout these four periods. In adult acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), daunomycin (DM), cytosine arabinoside (ard-C), 6-mercaptopurine (6MP), prednisolone (STH) (DCMP) or behenoyl ara-C, DM, 6-MP, STH (BH-AC.DMP) was the most popular since the latter half of the 1970s. Both in childhood ANLL and adult ALL, there was no predominant regimen whatsoever. In an analysis of survival curves for the above four periods, each survival plateau for childhood ALL rose over time with statistical significance, reaching over 90% in the 1980s, whereas those for adult ANLL were not so, suggesting that newer ANLL regimens in the 1980s did not play a successful role in cure-oriented therapy. Whether duration of post-remission chemotherapy could be a prognostic factor for these survivors was studied by dividing the duration as follows: less than one year, 1-2, 2-3, 3-5 and more than 5 years. A therapeutic gain, with a cure rate of over 90%, was observed in childhood ALL patients treated with chemotherapy for 5 years or longer. In adult ANLL patients, results were similar with chemotherapy groups of both less than one year and 5 years or longer. This suggests that risk-adapted therapy is an optimal strategy for cure of adult ANLL as well as childhood ALL.","['Kawashima, K', 'Hamajima, N', 'Yamada, K', 'Saito, H']","['Kawashima K', 'Hamajima N', 'Yamada K', 'Saito H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Analysis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(10):921-9. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90046-5.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90046-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the leaky scanning of ribosomes observed on the first AUG of the HBV P gene could be responsible for the synthesis of the two forms of reverse transcriptase described for HBV particles.","['Jean-Jean, O', 'Weimer, T', 'de Recondo, A M', 'Will, H', 'Rossignol, J M']","['Jean-Jean O', 'Weimer T', 'de Recondo AM', 'Will H', 'Rossignol JM']","['Laboratoire de Biologie Moleculaire de la Replication, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ER-272, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Recombinant/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Viral', 'Hepatitis B virus/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Ribosomes/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Dec;63(12):5451-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.12.5451-5454.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.12.5451-5454.1989 [doi]'],,PMC251214,,,,,,,,

The transforming sequence of this virus, v-cbl, shows no homology to known oncogenes but has some similarities to the yeast transcriptional factor GCN4. In this study we used a v-cbl probe to analyze mRNAs from a wide range of murine and human hemopoietic tumor cell lines and detected an 11-kilobase mRNA in all lineages. In normal mouse tissues the expression of c-cbl was highest in testis and thymus tissues, the predominant species in testis tissue being a 3.5-kilobase mRNA. The v-cbl oncogene was inserted into a bacterial expression vector to produce protein for the immunization of rabbits. Affinity-purified v-cbl antibodies identified abundant levels of p100gag-cbl in Cas NS-1-transformed fibroblasts and lower levels of a 135-kilodalton protein (p135c-cbl) in both normal and transformed cells. Subcellular fractionation showed that p100gag-cbl and p135c-cbl are both located in the nucleus and retained following 420 mM salt extraction. These results indicate that the translational product of a c-cbl is a 135-kilodalton nuclear protein.","['Langdon, W Y', 'Hyland, C D', 'Grumont, R J', 'Morse, H C 3rd']","['Langdon WY', 'Hyland CD', 'Grumont RJ', 'Morse HC 3rd']","['Division of Human Immunology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Protein v-cbl)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Protein v-cbl', 'Organ Specificity', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*genetics', 'Testis/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Dec;63(12):5420-4. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.12.5420-5424.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.12.5420-5424.1989 [doi]'],,PMC251210,,,,,,,,

There were highly significant correlations between the bone marrow and serum concentrations of the respective vitamin D metabolites. Especially, the concentrations of 25-OH-D and 1,25(OH)2D in the bone marrow gave very similar values to those in serum. This is a big advantage in controlling the bone marrow levels of vitamin D metabolites in patients with leukemia, because doctors can calculate the bone marrow levels from the serum levels of the respective vitamin D metabolites without bone marrow aspiration. When 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha-OH-D3) was administered orally to eight patients with leukemia, clinical conditions were improved in seven patients: four complete remissions (CR), one partial response (PR), and two minor responses (MR) without severe hypercalcemia.

The K36.16 tumor grows readily and does not confer protective immunity in AKR mice. A total of 37 H-2Kb-transfected K36.16 clones (Kb/K36.16) was isolated and studied individually. The Kb/K36.16 clones were found to differ significantly in the amount of the exogenous H-2Kb antigens expressed on their cell surface. Moreover, as a result of the transfection, the level of expression of the endogenous H-2Dk Ag was also altered when compared to that of the parental K36.16 tumor cells. All the Kb/K36.16 clones that were positive for the H-2Kb Ag were rejected by the semisyngeneic AKR mice. Moreover, some of these Kb/K36.16 clones were also rejected by syngeneic (AKR x C57BL/10)F1 mice. In consequence of immunization with the Kb/K36.16 clones, the AKR and F1 mice were able to survive a subsequent challenge of the wild-type, unmodified, parental K36.16 tumor cells. More importantly, some of these Kb/K36.16 clones demonstrated an active and specific immunotherapeutic effect, and they were able to eradicate the growth of the parental K36.16 tumor cells in AKR mice. This observation therefore reinforces the feasibility of using DNA-mediated gene transfer as a molecular approach to abrogate tumor growth.","['Hui, K M', 'Sim, T', 'Foo, T T', 'Oei, A A']","['Hui KM', 'Sim T', 'Foo TT', 'Oei AA']","['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, National University of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Clone Cells/analysis/immunology/transplantation', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', '*Genes, MHC Class I', '*Graft Rejection', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis/immunology/transplantation']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Dec 1;143(11):3835-43.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether the more controlled growth of less aggressive malignancies such as chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) may be associated with autocrine production of growth inhibitory factors. TNF inhibits the growth of both normal and leukemic hemopoietic progenitor cells. We find that exogenous TNF reduces the viability and DNA synthesis of purified myeloid cells from patients with CML and inhibits myeloid colony formation by patient progenitor cells. However, unlike progenitor cells from normal donors, patient myeloid progenitor cells also constitutively express mRNA for TNF and secrete functional TNF protein in culture. This endogenous TNF impedes the growth of CML cells because anti-TNF mAb shown to neutralize bioactive human TNF increases CML cell DNA synthesis whereas non-neutralizing anti-TNF mAb has no effect. Production of TNF by CML cells is not associated with production of lymphotoxin (TNF-beta), IL-1 or IL-6. TNF-mediated autocrine growth inhibition may contribute to the maintenance of the stable, chronic phase of this disease and similar mechanisms may operate in other malignancies to limit tumor proliferation. Competition between autocrine growth promoting and inhibiting factors may underlie the observed differences in biologic behavior between acute and chronic malignancies.","['Duncombe, A S', 'Heslop, H E', 'Turner, M', 'Meager, A', 'Priest, R', 'Exley, T', 'Brenner, M K']","['Duncombe AS', 'Heslop HE', 'Turner M', 'Meager A', 'Priest R', 'Exley T', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/analysis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/analysis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Dec 1;143(11):3828-34.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,

Biochemically, the proteins differed in their m.w. and pI points; serologically, although both molecules were recognized by TL alloantiserum, only the T13c protein was recognized by monoclonal TL antibodies. Interestingly, both proteins were serologically and immunochemically recognized by leukemia-specific TL.4 antiserum. The quantity of cell surface T13 was significantly greater than T3 possibly due to the less efficient splicing of T3 transcripts in the L cell nucleus; both genes directed the synthesis of cytoplasmic RNA containing an unspliced intron 3 as assessed by S1 analysis. In toto, the results suggest that T3c is similar or perhaps identical with the novel TL product previously identified on the surface of certain x-ray-induced BALB/c leukemias.","['Chorney, M J', 'Mashimo, H', 'Bushkin, Y', 'Nathenson, S G']","['Chorney MJ', 'Mashimo H', 'Bushkin Y', 'Nathenson SG']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Phenotype', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Transfection']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Dec 1;143(11):3762-8.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Assignment of disulfide bonds and visualization of its domain arrangement.,20526-31,"The amino acid sequence of one of the major lysosomal membrane glycoproteins, lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (lamp-1), was deduced from its cDNA sequence (Fukuda, M., Viitala, J., Matteson, J., and Carlsson, S. R. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18920-18928). This amino acid sequence suggests that lamp-1 contains a hinge-like structure and could form disulfide bridges that are observed in the immunoglobulin superfamily. To test this possibility, we have determined the positions of the disulfide bridges by isolating and sequencing cystine-containing peptides which contain disulfide bridges. The results indicate that disulfide arrangement of lamp-1 is different from that of immunoglobulins. Each molecule contains, in total, four loops formed by disulfide bonds, and each loop contains 36-39 amino acid residues. However, none of the disulfide bonds connects two domains that are separated by a hinge-like structure. The results indicate that the hinge region has no ordered structure, and the relative positions of the two domains can be altered in space. Examination of the ultrastructure of lamp-1 by electron microscopy showed that the hinge-like structure actually functions as a hinge. These results indicate that the lamp-1 molecule represents a novel family of glycoproteins with unique structural properties.","['Carlsson, S R', 'Fukuda, M']","['Carlsson SR', 'Fukuda M']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, University of Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigens, CD', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Disulfides/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Lysosome-Associated Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/isolation & purification', 'Protein Conformation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/analysis']",1989/12/05 00:00,1989/12/05 00:01,['1989/12/05 00:00'],"['1989/12/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/05 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Dec 5;264(34):20526-31.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(19)47094-4 [pii]'],['CA 48737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

In addition to previously suggested recognition mechanisms involving endogenous lectins and glycosyltransferases, an alternative possibility, based on carbohydrate-carbohydrate (Lex-Lex) interaction, has been raised (Eggens, I., Fenderson, B., Toyokuni, T., Dean, B., Stroud, M., and Hakomori, S.

The interaction requires a bivalent cation (Ca2+ or Mg2+) and can be inhibited by sialosyl 2----3 lactose, anti-GM3 antibody (DH2), anti-Gg3 antibody (2D4), or EDTA. The strength of interaction between GM3 liposome and the Gg3-coated plastic surface was highly density-dependent. The mouse lymphoma L5178 AA12 cell line (high expressor of Gg3) interacted specifically with the mouse B16 melanoma cell line (high expressor of GM3). The interaction was inhibited by 5 mM sialosyllactose, anti-GM3 antibody, anti-Gg3 antibody, and EDTA in analogy to GM3-Gg3 interaction. L5178 AV27, a genetically related variant clone which does not express Gg3, showed no interaction with B16 cells. Untreated AA12 cells, but not 2D4-treated AA12 cells or AV27 cells, interacted with GM3 coated on the plastic surface.

Mononuclear normal bone marrow cells, blasts from patients with ANLL, and HL-60 cells were incubated at room temperature (control) and at 42 degrees-44 degrees C for 0-120 min prior to assay in methylcellulose. The heat sensitivity of the leukemic cells was significantly greater than that of normal bone marrow progenitors. Two-h exposure to 43 degrees C, for example, resulted in survival of 52% of normal marrow CFU-GM, whereas only 3% of leukemic CFU-GM survived (p less than 0.001 for HL-60 cells and p less than 0.005 for patient blast cells). To determine the effect of hyperthermia on more primitive progenitors and on marrow stromal cells, long-term cultures of normal bone marrow were established using control and heat-treated cells. Generation of CFU-GM was detected in the nonadherent fraction of hyperthermia-treated samples throughout the 5-week culture period. Although stromal development was slightly delayed, hyperthermia-treated cells were able to establish stromal layers similar to control cells. These results indicate that normal bone marrow committed progenitor cells are more resistant to hyperthermia than are myeloid leukemic cells. Normal stromal cells and primitive cells assayed in long-term culture are also resistant to hyperthermia that is toxic for leukemic cells. Because of this differential sensitivity to heat, ex vivo hyperthermia may be applicable for removing residual leukemic cells from bone marrow harvested for autologous transplantation.","['Murphy, P B', 'Richman, C M']","['Murphy PB', 'Richman CM']","['Department of Medicine, Rush Medical College, Chicago, Illinois.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Survival', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Dec;17(11):1105-9.,0301-472X (Print) 0301-472X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

TrfRs, although not detected on quiescent T-cells from normal adults, are constitutively expressed at high level on the blasts from all T-ALL patients and bind normally to transferrin. Their number is modulated by the intracellular iron level, but is independent of exogenous interleukin 2. They also exhibit immunological and biochemical abnormalities, in that: (a) they react preferentially with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) that recognize ligand-binding domains of TrfR (42/6 and 43/31), as compared to MAbs (B3/25, OKT9) that interact with the nonligand binding domains; (b) they have a reduced molecular weight, as compared to TrfR on normal thymocytes and activated T-lymphocytes: this phenomenon is apparently related to a defective glycosylation. It is noteworthy that expression of TrfR was not observed in a large series of other types of acute leukemias, i.e., pre-B, B, and myeloid leukemias, excluding erythroleukemias. The constitutive, high level expression of TrfRs on T-ALL blasts may play a key role in the stepwise progression of this malignancy and particularly provide a proliferative advantage to T-ALL blasts as compared to normal T-lymphocytes. Furthermore, indirect evidence suggests that the glycosylation defect of TrfR on T-ALL blasts contributes to their tumorigenic capacity.","['Petrini, M', 'Pelosi-Testa, E', 'Sposi, N M', 'Mastroberardino, G', 'Camagna, A', 'Bottero, L', 'Mavilio, F', 'Testa, U', 'Peschle, C']","['Petrini M', 'Pelosi-Testa E', 'Sposi NM', 'Mastroberardino G', 'Camagna A', 'Bottero L', 'Mavilio F', 'Testa U', 'Peschle C']","['Department of Hematology-Oncology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Iron/pharmacology', 'Iron Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 15;49(24 Pt 1):6989-96.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

In the competition radioimmunoassay only minimal cross-reactivities were detected between HTLV-III p24 and both HTLV-I and HTLV-II. No cross-reactivity was detected with any other retrovirus. In the electrophoretic transfer blot system using rabbit antibody to HTLV-I, HTLV-II, and HTLV-III, low-level cross-reaction was detected between HTLV-I and HTLV-III and between HTLV-II and HTLV-III. Unlike the cross-reactivity between HTLV-I p24 and HTLV-III p24, which was bidirectional, the one between HTLV-II and HTLV-III was only a one-way reactivity. Antiserum to HTLV-II recognized HTLV-III p24, but the antiserum to HTLV-III did not recognize HTLV-II p24.

They derive from monocytic cells occurring in the adhering mononuclear fraction of the peripheral blood. Their subsequent evolution into mature MCs is primed by a MC generating lymphokine released by sensitized T-cells on restimulation by the antigen. MC granules contain preformed heparin histamine and eosinophil chemotactic factors. Other factors such as leukotriene B4 can be produced by MCs following stimulation. This is the case during the initial phase of nonspecific inflammations, when MCs are stimulated by complement activation. In the immediate type hypersensitivity reaction giving rise to IgE, MC degranulation occurs independent from complement. In IgG and IgM mediated reactions, however, MC involvement is effected by complement consumption and C5 a generation. In delayed type hypersensitivity MCs increase locally. Their functional significance remains obscure. MC neoplasias are rare and generally confined to the dermis. Cutaneous mastocytoses are called benign mastocytoma when localized and urticaria pigmentosa when disseminated. Generalized mastocytosis involves extracutaneous tissue irrespective of skin involvement. Those associated with urticaria pigmentosa-like skin lesions, present at the onset of the disease, have a significantly higher survival rate than those lacking a primary skin involvement. The term urticaria pigmentosa should be reserved for cases of cutaneous mastocytosis without extracutaneous involvement. Cases of mastocytoses lacking primary skin lesions assume a malignant course and are additionally aggravated by high incidence of myeloproliferative disorders and MC leukemia. MC sarcoma is an extremely rare neoplasia of MCs which may also terminate as a MC leukemia.","['Parwaresch, M R', 'Horny, H P', 'Lennert, K']","['Parwaresch MR', 'Horny HP', 'Lennert K']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathol Res Pract,"Pathology, research and practice",7806109,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Complement Activation', 'Histamine Release', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Mast Cells/pathology/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/diagnosis/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neoplasms/pathology', 'Skin Diseases/pathology', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/diagnosis/*pathology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Res Pract. 1985 Mar;179(4-5):439-61. doi: 10.1016/s0344-0338(85)80184-9.,0344-0338 (Print) 0344-0338 (Linking),,['10.1016/s0344-0338(85)80184-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,70,,,

An increased remission rate is obtained when m-AMSA is combined with other agents, especially with high-dose cytosine arabinoside, with a complete remission rate of 50-60% in relapsed patients.

Five morphological subsets of B-lymphocytes were identified: (i) 40% had a high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio, well condensed chromatin and small pale granules localised in one area of the cytoplasm, these cells expressed HLA-Dr and did not react with any of the other McAb; (ii) 40% had a prominent nucleolus, variable amount of chromatin condensation and localised granules, these cells were HLA-Dr positive and some of them expressed FMC7 as do the cells of B-PLL; (iii) 10% had a villous outline and variable numbers of polyribosomes scattered throughout the cytoplasm, some of these cells resembled morphologically HCL cells and were HLA-Dr +, FMC7 +, alpha HC1 +, alpha HC2 + and OKT10 +/-. The remaining two types of B-cells (10%) had the morphology of antibody secreting cells with parallel arrays of endoplasmic reticulum and some displayed electron dense granules in the Golgi zone.

MMuLV production was inhibited in glutamine- and isoleucine (Gln-Ile)-deprived G0/G1 cells. In contrast, butyric acid treatment, which efficiently arrested the cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, did not inhibit MMuLV production. Furthermore, the inhibition of MMuLV production caused by either Gln-Ile deprivation or by interferon (IFN) treatment was overcome by butyric acid treatment. Thus, the replication of MMuLV could be dissociated from cell proliferation. The inhibition of MMuLV production in Gln-Ile-deprived cell cultures was compared to the inhibitory effect of IFN, which is known to affect budding and release of the virus. Rates of MMuLV protein synthesis were not affected in both the IFN-treated and Gln-Ile-deprived cells. However, processing of the viral polyprotein Pre65gag into p30 was blocked in the Gln-Ile-deprived cells. Furthermore, whereas in IFN-treated cells, MMuLV accumulated on the cell surface and could be released upon treatment with trypsin, in Gln-Ile-deprived cells, no virions were released by such treatment. These results indicate that in cells arrested by Gln-Ile deprivation, MMuLV is inhibited at a posttranslation step. This step appears to precede the anti-MMuLV block induced by IFN.","['Gloger, I', 'Arad, G', 'Panet, A']","['Gloger I', 'Arad G', 'Panet A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '04Y7590D77 (Isoleucine)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Cell Cycle', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Isoleucine/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Temperature', 'Viral Proteins/biosynthesis', '*Virus Replication']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Jun;54(3):844-50. doi: 10.1128/JVI.54.3.844-850.1985.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.54.3.844-850.1985 [doi]'],,PMC254872,,,,,,,,

Genes that are not expressed in the erythroid lineage, such as the Ig alpha and albumin genes, distribute preferentially into the soluble rather than the insoluble fraction, and are organized into nucleosomes in both fractions. Both alpha 1- and beta maj-globin genes are enriched in the insoluble fraction and are organized into structures that are partially devoid of nucleosomes in uninduced MELC, when the genes are transcriptionally inactive. Following chemical induction of MELC and the onset of globin gene transcription, globin gene enrichment and nucleosome disruption in the insoluble chromatin fraction increase. Using seven DNA subclones that span the beta maj-globin gene we show that insolubility and nucleosome disruption are largely limited to DNA sequences lying within the transcribed domain. Non-transcribed, flanking sequences are soluble and organized into nucleosomes. In addition, the globin genes found in insoluble, non-nucleosomal chromatin contain previously engaged RNA polymerases which can elongate globin RNA chains in vitro in a pattern qualitatively and quantitatively similar to intact nuclei.

T cell clones derived from long-term lines propagated by in vitro culture with irradiated tumor cells and syngeneic spleen cells were exclusively of the Lyt-2+ phenotype. Such clones were cytolytic, retained their proliferative phenotype indefinitely when expanded by repeated cycles of reactivation and rest, and recognized a tumor-specific cell surface antigen in association with class I MHC molecules. This tumor cell antigen was not present on nontransformed virus-infected cells. Class II MHC-restricted MT4+ clones specific for the viral antigen gp70 were derived from lymph node T cells of FBL-3 tumor-immune mice only by in vitro culture with purified Friend virus in the presence of syngeneic splenic APC. Once derived, however, such clones could be stimulated in the presence of FBL-3 tumor cells and syngeneic spleen cells, demonstrating the reprocessing of tumor-derived gp70 antigen by APC in the spleen cell population. In contrast, no reprocessing of the tumor cell surface antigen by splenic APC for presentation to the class I MHC-restricted T cell clones could be demonstrated. Evidence is presented that FBL-3 T leukemia/lymphoma cells function as APC for Lyt-2+ class I MHC-restricted clones, and that no concomitant recognition of Ia molecules is required to activate these clones. Both Lyt-2+ and MT4+ clones were induced to proliferate in the presence of exogenous IL2 alone, but this stimulus failed to result in significant release of immune interferon. In contrast, antigen stimulation of both clones resulted in proliferation as well as significant immune interferon release.

Differentiation and 8-bromo-cAMP elicit a large and selective increase in the rate of biosynthesis of only one type of RII.,6296-303,"The concentration of regulatory subunits (R) of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase increased 4- to 5-fold when Friend erythroleukemic cells were either grown in medium containing 0.5 mM 8-bromo-cAMP and 0.2 mM methylisobutylxanthine or stimulated to differentiate. Two species of RII with apparent Mr values of 54,000 (RII-54) and 52,000 (RII-52) are expressed in Friend cells. Both forms of RII were (a) covalently labeled with 8-N3-[32P]cAMP, (b) phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase II, and (c) complexed by polyclonal anti-RII IgGs. RII-52 and RII-54 were not interconverted by phosphorylation or dephosphorylation. A monoclonal antibody that recognizes an internal site in RII resolved the two cAMP-binding proteins by preferentially binding RII-54. The structural diversity suggested by the monoclonal antibody experiment was further examined by comparing two-dimensional maps of tryptic peptides obtained from metabolically labeled [( 35S]met) RII-52 and RII-54. Groups of 35S-labeled peptides that were either uniquely derived from RII-54 or obtained only from RII-52 were readily distinguished, thereby demonstrating that Friend cells produce two separate and distinct forms of type II cAMP-binding subunits. The relative rate of synthesis of RII-52 increased 12- to 14-fold during erythroid differentiation and treatment with 8-bromo-cAMP, while the rate of RII-54 synthesis either declined slowly or was unchanged. Thus, two homologous forms of RII are subject to different modes of physiological (differentiation) and pharmacological (chronic 8-Br-cAMP) regulation, and the accumulation of total RII observed in the present and previous (Schwartz, D. A., and Rubin, C. S. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 777-784) studies results from a selective increase in the rate of biosynthesis of RII-52.","['Schwartz, D A', 'Rubin, C S']","['Schwartz DA', 'Rubin CS']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (protein kinase modulator)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)', 'TBT296U68M (1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['1-Methyl-3-isobutylxanthine/pharmacology', '8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation']",1985/05/25 00:00,1985/05/25 00:01,['1985/05/25 00:00'],"['1985/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1985 May 25;260(10):6296-303.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(18)88970-0 [pii]'],"['5T32-GM-07260/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-22792/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) isolated from patients with adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) did not express viral antigens of HTLV, but PBL that had been cultured for 2 days did express these viral antigens. Most parts of the gag, pol and env regions of the HTLV provirus in PBL isolated from 12 ATL patients and PBL cultured for 2 days were hypermethylated as reported by others. In contrast, in 10 established cell lines that harbored HTLV genomes and expressed viral antigens, HTLV proviruses were hypomethylated. In one cell line, ATL-IK, which harbored an HTLV genome but did not produce viral antigens, the gag, pol and env regions were hypermethylated. However, two HpaII sites, one in the middle of the gag region and the other in the middle of the pol region, were not methylated even in PBL from most ATL patients. Furthermore, the pX and LTR regions were hypomethylated not only in established cell lines but also in PBL of ATL patients. The hypomethylation of the pX and LTR regions detected in fresh leukemic cells of ATL patients may have some etiological significance in cell transformation by controlling the level of transcription of these regions, or modulating the binding of some factors to these regions.","['Kitamura, T', 'Takano, M', 'Hoshino, H', 'Shimotohno, K', 'Shimoyama, M', 'Miwa, M', 'Takaku, F', 'Sugimura, T']","['Kitamura T', 'Takano M', 'Hoshino H', 'Shimotohno K', 'Shimoyama M', 'Miwa M', 'Takaku F', 'Sugimura T']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease HpaII)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Deltaretrovirus/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonuclease HpaII', 'Female', '*Genes', '*Genes, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Methylation', 'Middle Aged', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/immunology/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/microbiology']",1985/05/15 00:00,1985/05/15 00:01,['1985/05/15 00:00'],"['1985/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 May 15;35(5):629-35. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910350510.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),,['10.1002/ijc.2910350510 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Shortening of the clotting time in PF-3 test performed with isologous platelets was found in 30 of 44 cases as a result of accelerating the intrinsic coagulation pathway. During AL remission in 6 examined cases an effect of this serum activity on autologous platelets was demonstrated. Serum anti-platelet activity was inhibited by rabbit anti-IgG. The obtained results suggest that the activity present in the globulin fraction of AL patients serum may contribute to thrombocytopenia in this disease. The influence of various concentrations and combinations of cytostatics on PF-3 and the inhibition of clot retraction tests were examined in vitro. Out of vincristine, methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside and cerubidine only the combination of cytosine arabinoside and vincristine caused the clotting time in the PF-3 test to be shortened.

Granulocyte cAMP-PDE activity was similar in the general group of CML patients to that in normal granulocytes; the cGMP-PDE, however, was somewhat higher. By dividing the CML general group into the ""low leukocyte count"" subgroup including granulocytes of patients with WBC number ranging from 10,300 to 40,000 per microliter (mean 22,000 per microliter), and the ""high leukocyte count"" subgroup including patients with leukocyte count above 40,000 per microliter (mean 67,000) remarkable differences in the activities of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases between these subgroups could be found: cAMP-PDE activity for the high leukocyte count subgroups was significantly higher than for that in normals, and in CML-low leukocyte count subgroup. On the other hand, cGMP-PDE activity in granulocytes of the high leukocyte count subgroup was found to be remarkably lower than that in normals, in the low leukocyte count subgroup and general CML group. In CML patients the ratio of cAMP-PDE activity to cGMP-PDE activity was always considerably higher than that in controls. The obtained results suggest CML granulocytes to differ from normal ones in respect to their control of intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels. This difference is related to the accumulation of CML granulocytes.","['Naskalski, J W', 'Ucinski, W S']","['Naskalski JW', 'Ucinski WS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch,"Folia haematologica (Leipzig, Germany : 1928)",0374615,"[""EC 3.1.4.17 (3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases)"", ""EC 3.1.4.35 (3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases)""]",IM,"[""3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases/*blood"", ""3',5'-Cyclic-GMP Phosphodiesterases/*blood"", 'Female', 'Granulocytes/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Male']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Haematol Int Mag Klin Morphol Blutforsch. 1985;112(1):134-40.,0323-4347 (Print) 0323-4347 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 88% of the patients with clinically typical CML present with a cytogenetic abnormality known as the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Additionally, the leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) value is decreased in CML. To investigate if there are selected genes expressed in the CML cell population, poly(A+)RNA from a chronic-phase, Ph1-positive CML patient was used for construction of a complementary DNA (cDNA) library. Recombinant clones representing moderately to abundantly transcribed sequences were selected by annealing [32P]-cDNA transcribed from homologous RNA to the library sequences and assessing radioactivity in the hybrids. From an initial 729 colonies, 417 (57.2%) displayed a hybridization signal more intense than controls, indicating these recombinant plasmids contained sequences homologous to moderately or highly expressed RNAs from this particular patient. Screening of the 417 clones--utilizing 32P-cDNAs derived from normal human placenta, an acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML), and two other CML samples--was used to select clones likely to represent sequences preferentially expressed in CML. Sixteen recombinants were initially selected that repeatedly failed to display hybridization with the placenta and AMML-derived probes. Further analysis of eight of these clones indicated that six contain sequences preferentially expressed in CML. One clone, C-A3, has been studied with 63 different RNA samples. This sequence is found to be highly expressed in peripheral blood cells from the chronic phase of both Ph1-positive and Ph1-negative CML as well as in a Ph1-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).

We investigated the reactivity of 20 distinct murine MAs defining markers of glioma-associated or predominantly lymphoid distribution for 13 human glioma-derived (HGL) cell lines and frozen sections of 19 human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and six astrocytomas (AST). Methods included radioimmunoassay, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, and absorption analysis. Two markers, HLA-A,B and human Thy-1, exhibited no deviation; all HGL cell lines tested bound high levels of specific MA. Individual HGL cell line reactivity with the MA panel ranged from 30 to 70%. HGL cell lines (7/13) which reacted with greater than or equal to 50% of the antiglioma MAs had the highest (30-70%) positive reactivity rates with the anti-lymphoid marker MA panel; complex antigenicity in one system correlated with multiple antigens in the other. Within the anti-lymphoid marker MA panel, subpopulations of 4/13 HGL cell lines were clearly positive for the HLA-DR (Ia) antigens; another 3/13 HGL cell lines were strongly positive for common acute lymphocytic leukemia antigen (CALLA). With the exception of Thymocyte 1 antigen (Thy-1), reactivity for early and mature T-cell markers was infrequent and sporadic. Lymphoid marker expression by HGL cell lines is highly heterogeneous, ranging from few (Thy-1 and HLA-A,B) to complex expression of Ia, T-cell, and lymphoid tumor markers. GBM and AST tissues were antigenically less complex; for each of 6/8 anti-glioma MA, 70-100% of GBM and 66-100% of AST were positive. Two MAs were highly reactive (7/10, 8/9) with GBM sections and minimally so (1/6) with AST. Antigenic expression in gliomas is complex and heterogeneous; however, clear differences in lymphoid marker expression, the identification of widely and rarely expressed glioma-associated antigens, and the potential of immunologic differentiation between GBM and AST by large panels of MAs will serve to reduce the complexity and may be of potential diagnostic or prognostic significance.","['Wikstrand, C J', 'Grahmann, F C', 'McComb, R D', 'Bigner, D D']","['Wikstrand CJ', 'Grahmann FC', 'McComb RD', 'Bigner DD']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,2985192R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Brain/immunology', 'Cell Line', '*Epitopes', 'Fetus', 'Glioblastoma/immunology', 'Glioma/*immunology', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Muridae', 'Nervous System Neoplasms/*immunology']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol. 1985 May;44(3):229-41. doi: 10.1097/00005072-198505000-00002.,0022-3069 (Print) 0022-3069 (Linking),,['10.1097/00005072-198505000-00002 [doi]'],"['1-PO1 NS/CA 20023/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Following infection, the T4 antigen-specific clone manifested a tenfold increase in its surface interleukin 2 (IL 2) receptor (Tac) density and acquired the viral determinants p19, p24, and 4D12 not present in the uninfected clone. Prior to infection, the T cell clone responded to antigen stimulation in the presence of histocompatible antigen-presenting cells with proliferation and secretion of multiple lymphokines, including IL 2, B cell growth factor (BCGF), B cell differentiation factor (BCDF), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Following infection, the T cell clone both proliferated and produced constitutively three of these lymphokines (BCGF, BCDF, and IFN-gamma) in the absence of accessory cells or antigen. Co-cultivation with any accessory cells regardless of histocompatibility resulted in increased proliferation and lymphokine production. IL 2 production by the HTLV-I-transformed cell, however, could not be detected. Similarly, the uninfected clone was able to provide B cell help for Ig production only when stimulated with both histocompatible cells and antigen. In contrast, the infected cell provided T cell help to B cells in an unregulated manner, independent of antigen or histocompatibility. Thus, functions such as the induction of proliferation, B cell help, and lymphokine production, which are finely regulated in uninfected antigen-specific T cell clones, became indiscriminant after HTLV-I infection.","['Volkman, D J', 'Popovic, M', 'Gallo, R C', 'Fauci, A S']","['Volkman DJ', 'Popovic M', 'Gallo RC', 'Fauci AS']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Growth Substances/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/analysis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology/metabolism']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jun;134(6):4237-43.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared BCL1 tumor B cells, normal B cells giving rise to a polyclonal response without the intentional addition of antigen, and an antigen-driven, SRBC-specific response. BCL1 tumor B cells gave maximum PFC responses when partially purified BCGFII was added or when suboptimal doses of BCGFII were mixed with one of several putative terminal differentiation factors we call B cell differentiation factors BCDF. IFN-gamma was not active as any of these factors. Maximum polyclonal responses of B cells were seen when either IL 2 or BCGFII were mixed with BCDF. In contrast, SRBC-specific responses showed a strict requirement for IL 2, and BCGFII and BCDF synergized with IL 2 to give a maximum response. The involvement of BCGFII in all of these responses suggests that BCGFII acts as a growth factor for a population of B cells that has differentiated much of the way towards Ig secretion, and that many B cells become responsive to this growth factor. In addition, the fact that different lymphokine requirements were seen in the different experimental systems raises the possibility that there are multiple pathways to Ig secretion, and suggests that different subpopulations of B cells defined either by different lineages or by different stages of development within a single lineage have requirements for distinct lymphokines that regulate their growth and differentiation.","['Swain, S L']",['Swain SL'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Synergism', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Growth Substances/*physiology', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C']",1985/06/01 00:00,1985/06/01 00:01,['1985/06/01 00:00'],"['1985/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Jun;134(6):3934-43.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,['AI-08795/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Here we describe the effect of Mu IFN-alpha/beta on an established leukemia. Varying doses of Mu IFN-alpha/beta were injected over 3 days, starting 8 to 12 days after virus inoculation. The effect of Mu IFN-alpha/beta on the leukemic process was monitored by measuring the spleen weight, reverse transcriptase activity in the serum and, in selected experiments, by microscopic examination of sections of the spleen using standard histological and immunological staining techniques. Depending on the spleen weight at the start of its application (maximal about 450 mg), Mu IFN-alpha/beta caused a dramatic reduction in the number of virus-infected erythroleukemic cells in the spleen. Also, R-MuLV disappeared from the serum within 3 days.

In a cytokinetic study, a combination of Feulgen microcytofluorometry and tritiated thymidine autoradiography (3H-TdR ARG) was used to measure DNA content and to determine DNA synthesis simultaneously in a single cell. Administration of 200 mg/kg of BH-AC significantly prolonged the survival time of mice bearing L 1210. In addition, the cells in the G1 + S1 phases increased with time, accounting for 94.4 per cent of all cells measured at 48 h after the administration, compared to 73.7 per cent before administration. On the other hand, following the administration of 86 mg/kg of ara-C (equivalent to 200 mg/kg of BH-AC), the percentage of cells in the S1 + S2 phases increased maximally to 75.9 per cent at 18 h. Cytokinetic studies further showed that BH-AC administration blocks DNA synthesis of the cells in the S-phase for a longer period than does ara-C. These results suggest that the prolonged inhibition by BH-AC on DNA synthesis allows cells to accumulate in the S-phase to a greater degree.","['Maruo, N', 'Horiuchi, H', 'Nakabo, T', 'Kondo, M', 'Nakamura, T']","['Maruo N', 'Horiuchi H', 'Nakabo T', 'Kondo M', 'Nakamura T']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Feulgen stain)', '0 (Rosaniline Dyes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '9YVR68W306 (enocitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Count', 'Coloring Agents', 'Cytarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Mice', '*Rosaniline Dyes', 'Staining and Labeling', 'Time Factors']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1985 Jan-Mar;3(1):39-48. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900030106.,0278-0232 (Print) 0278-0232 (Linking),,['10.1002/hon.2900030106 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The method comprised isolation of white cells from peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates, drug exposure and incubation for 4 days. Drug-induced tumour cell kill was assessed by differential staining of live and dead cells such that the former could be morphologically identified. Tumour cell viability was subsequently calculated by reference to an internal standard of fixed duck red blood cells. Over 30 drugs have been tested in vitro, all of which have shown a dose response relationship in vitro and given a good scatter of sensitivities from patient to patient within the concentration ranges tested. In 27 cases where the in vitro chemosensitivity could be compared with the in vivo response, there were 7 true positive comparisons (sensitive in vitro and in vivo), 17 true negative comparisons (resistant both in vitro and in vivo) and 3 false positive comparisons (sensitive in vitro, resistant in vivo). A result was obtained in 38 of 50 samples received, comprising 16 of 18 chronic lymphocytic leukaemias, 11 of 20 acute lymphoblastic leukaemias, 5 of 5 acute myeloid leukaemias and 6 of 7 myelomas.

The potentiation occurred with concentrations of lidocaine that were nontoxic and was dependent upon both the concentration of lidocaine and BLM A2. A 1000-fold decrease in survival was seen with a 1-h exposure to 8 mM lidocaine and 10 microM BLM A2 compared to incubation with 10 microM BLM A2 alone. Prior exposure to lidocaine did not markedly alter BLM A2 cytotoxicity, while treatment with lidocaine immediately after BLM A2 exposure did, suggesting that increased cellular content of BLM A2 was not the mechanism of enhancement. Furthermore, lidocaine reduced the total amount of cell-associated radioactivity seen after incubation with [3H]BLM A2. The enhancement in L1210 cell cytotoxicity with lidocaine was not specific for the C- and N-terminal moieties of the BLM molecule. Other DNA-interacting antitumor agents, such as etoposide and mitomycin C, did not exhibit biologically significant alterations in their cytotoxicity when coincubated with lidocaine, although cis-diamminedichloroplatinum was significantly more toxic in the presence of lidocaine. The potentiation of BLM A2 cytotoxicity was not unique to murine tumor cells, since it was also seen with cultured human head and neck carcinoma (A-253) cells. Lidocaine did not increase directly BLM A2-induced breakage of DNA in vitro as measured by loss of form I pAT 153 DNA, but it did increase BLM A2-induced DNA strand breaks in intact L1210 cells coincubated with lidocaine and BLM A2. Exposure of L1210 cells to lidocaine after BLM A2 treatment also greatly increased DNA breakage consistent with possible inhibition of DNA repair. In addition, a modest reduction in the in vitro inactivation of BLM A2 by BLM hydrolase was found with lidocaine. We propose that inhibition of BLM metabolism and repair of BLM-induced DNA damage by lidocaine may have a role in the enhanced cytotoxicity.","['Lazo, J S', 'Braun, I D', 'Meandzija, B', 'Kennedy, K A', 'Pham, E T', 'Smaldone, L F']","['Lazo JS', 'Braun ID', 'Meandzija B', 'Kennedy KA', 'Pham ET', 'Smaldone LF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '98PI200987 (Lidocaine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Lidocaine/*pharmacology', 'Mice']",1985/05/01 00:00,1985/05/01 00:01,['1985/05/01 00:00'],"['1985/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 May;45(5):2103-9.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA-09200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We examined the formation, retention, and cytotoxic effects of methotrexate (MTX) polyglutamates (MTX-PGs) in these purified myeloid precursor cells. After 1- and 24-h exposures to MTX, with thymidine and deoxyinosine as rescue, the intracellular MTX-PG profile was examined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Efflux patterns of MTX-PGs were also studied after additional 1- and 24-h incubations in drug-free media. Cytotoxic effects of retained MTX-PGs on bone marrow myeloid precursors were examined by colony formation in drug-free semisolid agar. Normal myeloid precursor cells converted MTX to MTX-PGs in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, preferentially retaining MTX-PGs with three to five glutamyl moieties. At low concentrations of MTX (1 microM), MTX-PG formation was insufficient to maintain saturation of the target enzyme dihydrofolate reductase after removal of drug from the incubation medium, and there was no decrease in myeloid colony formation. At higher concentrations of MTX (10 microM), formation of higher molecular weight polyglutamates was sufficient to allow for 24-h saturation of intracellular binding capacity after removal of extracellular drug and resulted in a 35% reduction in the formation of colony-forming units in culture. Comparison of MTX metabolism in normal bone marrow cells and the MTX-sensitive HL-60 human leukemia cell line showed twofold greater PG formation by these tumor cells after 24-h exposure to 1 or 10 microM MTX, and a marked (greater than 30-fold) increase in cytotoxicity for the HL-60 cells as compared with normal myeloid precursors, suggesting that the MTX polyglutamation may be important to its selective antitumor action.","['Koizumi, S', 'Curt, G A', 'Fine, R L', 'Griffin, J D', 'Chabner, B A']","['Koizumi S', 'Curt GA', 'Fine RL', 'Griffin JD', 'Chabner BA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inosine', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1985 Mar;75(3):1008-14. doi: 10.1172/JCI111761.,0021-9738 (Print) 0021-9738 (Linking),,['10.1172/JCI111761 [doi]'],,PMC423648,,,,,,,,

Tissue specific phenotypic differences concern the expression of B7 and HLA-DC on spleen but not on bone marrow B cells. This study indicates that the distribution of the CALL antigen across the B cell committed lineage is much wider in fetal than neonatal life since CALLA+B cells have not yet been detected in bone marrow and peripheral blood of normal infants and adults.

Mo5 is borne by the malignant cells of 74% of patients (N = 27) with acute monocytic leukemia (French-American-British [FAB] group M4, M5), and 50% of patients (N = 38) with acute granulocytic leukemia (FAB M1, M2, and M3). Nonmyeloid cells in peripheral blood and bone marrow are Mo5-negative. The surface expression of Mo5 by myeloid cells is modulated by several experimental conditions: Exposure of neutrophils to calcium ionophore (1 mumol/L, 37 degrees C, ten minutes) under conditions resulting in degranulation of specific granules produces a three- to fourfold increase in the plasma membrane density of Mo5 antigen. This suggests that, in neutrophils, there is an intracellular pool of Mo5 antigen, which may be associated with specific granules, and that granule-associated Mo5 is translocated to the plasma membrane upon degranulation. Conversely, incubation of monocytes, neutrophils, U-937, and Mo5-positive leukemia cells in medium containing anti-Mo5 monoclonal antibody results in a significant decrease in surface Mo5 expression. This loss of surface Mo5 is a rapid, temperature-dependent process (occurring within 30 minutes at 37 degrees C) that is produced by divalent anti-Mo5 immunoglobulin [F(ab')2 but not F(ab)]. After down-modulation, Mo5 is reexpressed by monocytes within 48 hours. Mo5 is therefore a human myelomonocytic differentiation antigen whose expression is modulated up or down depending on the nature of extracellular stimuli.","['Todd, R F 3rd', 'Roach, J A', 'Arnaout, M A']","['Todd RF 3rd', 'Roach JA', 'Arnaout MA']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Epitopes)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Epitopes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1985 Apr;65(4):964-73.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)83605-2 [pii]'],"['CA33555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39064/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In addition, blast cell colonies from one patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) were studied. The growth of normal CFU-GM and AML blast cell colonies was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by gamma- and alpha-IFN. gamma-IFN was ten to 100 times more potent than alpha-IFN in that this species of IFN reduced colony formation by greater than 50% at concentrations of less than 15 antiviral U/mL.

Thereafter the frequency rose to 50% and remained at that level beyond one year after BMT. In successful grafts the gamma globulins are of donor origin six months after BMT; thus donor B cells are capable of forming lymphocytotoxic antibodies even when the immune system is suppressed by cyclosporine. The antibodies had recognizable HLA specificity in about half the cases before and after BMT. When donor and patient were HLA-identical, HLA specificity did not correspond to donor/recipient antigens. In two cases in which the donor was matched for only one haplotype, antibodies formed by recipient cells, active against donor HLA antigens, were found.","['Lawler, S D', 'Jones, E H', 'Jackson, S', 'Powles, R L']","['Lawler SD', 'Jones EH', 'Jackson S', 'Powles RL']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antilymphocyte Serum/*biosynthesis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Female', 'HLA Antigens/analysis/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Male']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1985 Mar;39(3):263-5. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198503000-00010.,0041-1337 (Print) 0041-1337 (Linking),,['10.1097/00007890-198503000-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A solid-phase radioimmunoassay was used to detect antigenic markers of the retroviruses. Crude extracts from short-term cultures of lymphocytes infected with LAV bound rabbit antisera to the LAV glycoprotein gp13 (molecular weight 13,000) and the BLV proteins p24 and gp51, but did not bind antibodies to the p24 of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I). Antiserum to LAV gp13 reacted with an ovine cell line producing BLV but also weakly with virus-free ovine cells. Lymphocyte cultures from four African patients with AIDS expressed BLV-related antigens within 6 to 10 days of culture, at the moment when particle-bound reverse transcriptase was produced. BLV-related antigens were induced in lymphocyte cultures from healthy individuals by addition of filtered supernatant or irradiated cells of the original culture. The antisera to BLV used in this study may prove useful for the detection of AIDS-associated viruses in short-term cultures of lymphocytes from AIDS patients or their contacts.","['Thiry, L', 'Sprecher-Goldberger, S', 'Jacquemin, P', 'Cogniaux, J', 'Burny, A', 'Bruck, C', 'Portetelle, D', 'Cran, S', 'Clumeck, N']","['Thiry L', 'Sprecher-Goldberger S', 'Jacquemin P', 'Cogniaux J', 'Burny A', 'Bruck C', 'Portetelle D', 'Cran S', 'Clumeck N']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*microbiology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cross Reactions', 'Deltaretrovirus/*immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/*microbiology', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Sheep', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",1985/03/22 00:00,1985/03/22 00:01,['1985/03/22 00:00'],"['1985/03/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/22 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1985 Mar 22;227(4693):1482-4. doi: 10.1126/science.2579433.,0036-8075 (Print) 0036-8075 (Linking),,['10.1126/science.2579433 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The anti-JH 1 antisera reacted with normal and monoclonal in vitro grown T-cell lines as judged by microhemagglutination and binding in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Immunologically cross-reactive membrane components disclosed by immunoblot transfer analysis (""Western blots"") consisted of major components in the molecular weight range 30-35,000 and minor components in the range 65-70,000. The major product of the human T-cell leukemia line MOLT-3 had an approximate mass of 34,000 Da, a value consistent with the predicted size of the molecule specified by the recently described putative T-cell receptor gene YT35. The 65 to 70,000-Da components are most probably tightly associated dimers of the 30 to 35,000-Da forms. It was possible to align the JH sequences of molecules reactive with the anti-JH 1 antisera and other characterized VH sequences of molecules known to be cross-reactive with T-cell products. This facilitated a comparison disclosing clear segmental homology between the protein sequence derived from the YT35 gene and immunoglobulin VH framework regions sharing approximately 50% of sequence identity. The identification of VH-related T-cell products (termed VT-bearing molecules) with products of putative T-cell receptor genes gained further support by N-terminal sequence of the 68,000-Da product of the 70-N2 T-cell line which showed homology to the predicted N-terminal region of the YT35 product. These serological and protein chemical data, coupled with the comparison to gene sequence, show that T-cell components that bear serological determinants cross-reactive with VH show segmental homology with products of putative T-cell receptor genes and immunoglobulin VH.","['Mackel-Vandersteenhoven, A', 'Vasta, G R', 'Waxdal, M J', 'Marchalonis, J J']","['Mackel-Vandersteenhoven A', 'Vasta GR', 'Waxdal MJ', 'Marchalonis JJ']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

No viral transcription was detected in the brain of drug-exposed animals. When postnatal Mov-7/Mov-10 F1 mice were treated with the drug, infectious virus was generated efficiently and resulted in virus spread and viremia in all animals by 3 weeks of age. In contrast, infectious virus was not generated in F1 mice that had been treated during gestation with up to sublethal doses of the drug.

An experimental approach using anti-human globin monoclonal antibodies for detection, efficient cloning, and monitoring of hybrids of interest was employed. Further characterization of hybrids used isoelectric focusing for detection of human globins and S1 nuclease mapping. In contrast to the parental HEL line, all chromosome 11-retaining HEL-MEL hybrids expressed human beta-globin, suggesting that the HEL beta-globin genes (i) are transcriptionally competent, (ii) become activated in response to a positive trans-acting element within the MEL environment, and (iii) fail to express into the HEL environment because of either the absence of a positive trans-acting element or the presence of a trans-acting inhibitor of beta-globin gene expression. In addition to beta-globin, the primary HEL-MEL hybrids co-expressed gamma-globin; however, gamma-globin expression segregated by subcloning so that secondary and tertiary clones either expressed only beta-globin or co-expressed gamma- and beta-globin. The results of subcloning can be explained by assuming that gamma-globin gene expression is controlled by a HEL cell-derived transacting element encoded by a gene not syntenic to chromosome 11 or by postulating that the HEL gamma-globin genes become randomly modified during the continuous proliferation of hybrids.","['Papayannopoulou, T H', 'Lindsley, D', 'Kurachi, S', 'Lewison, K', 'Hemenway, T', 'Melis, M', 'Anagnou, N P', 'Najfeld, V']","['Papayannopoulou TH', 'Lindsley D', 'Kurachi S', 'Lewison K', 'Hemenway T', 'Melis M', 'Anagnou NP', 'Najfeld V']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (DNA Restriction Enzymes)', 'EC 3.1.30.1 (Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'DNA Restriction Enzymes/metabolism', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/genetics', 'Fluorometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/*metabolism', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', 'Single-Strand Specific DNA and RNA Endonucleases']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1985 Feb;82(3):780-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.82.3.780.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.82.3.780 [doi]'],['AM30852/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],PMC397130,,,,,,,,

This potentiation occurred with nontoxic concentrations of calmodulin antagonists. The most potent blockers of L1210 calmodulin activity, melittin and mastoparan, were the most potent potentiators of bleomycin A2 cytotoxicity. Less potent agents such as pimozide, a diphenylbutylpiperidine, trifluoperazine and chlorpromazine, phenothiazines, and W-7, a naphthalene sulfonamide, required higher concentrations for potentiation of bleomycin A2-induced cytotoxicity, while homologs that lack anticalmodulin activity failed to increase the cytotoxicity seen with bleomycin A2. The potentiation of bleomycin A2 cytotoxicity was not due to an elevated cellular content of bleomycin A2 or to inhibition of bleomycin A2 inactivation. Using alkaline elution techniques, we found that pimozide increased bleomycin A2-induced DNA damage in intact L1210 cells. Pimozide did not, however, directly increase the formation of reactive species by bleomycin as measured by single or double strand breakage of covalently closed circular DNA. Thus, the potentiation of bleomycin cytotoxicity by these agents appears to be mediated by an increased damage to cellular DNA; this may be due to inhibition of DNA repair. The hypothesized calmodulin-dependent mechanism was not shared by all agents that caused breaks in DNA because no potentiation in cytotoxicity was observed when calmodulin antagonists were combined with either etoposide or X-irradiation.","['Lazo, J S', 'Hait, W N', 'Kennedy, K A', 'Braun, I D', 'Meandzija, B']","['Lazo JS', 'Hait WN', 'Kennedy KA', 'Braun ID', 'Meandzija B']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Wasp Venoms)', '016U10PN9N (opromazine)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '1HIZ4DL86F (Pimozide)', '20449-79-0 (Melitten)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '65595-90-6 (W 7)', '72093-21-1 (mastoparan)', '7B979CWO03 (N-(6-aminohexyl)-1-naphthalenesulfonamide)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'U42B7VYA4P (Chlorpromazine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bleomycin/*therapeutic use', 'Calmodulin/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chlorpromazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Drug Synergism', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Melitten/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Peptides', 'Pimozide/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology', 'Wasp Venoms/pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Mar;27(3):387-93.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,['CA-28852/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Therefore, B16G was used as a probe to identify T cell hybridomas secreting putative TsF. Hybridomas were obtained by the fusion of DBA/2 thymocytes stimulated in vivo by P815 tumor membrane extracts with the thymoma BW5147. One such hybridoma, A10, was selected and used for additional studies. From both the supernatants and ascites fluid of this hybrid a factor could be obtained that could specifically bind to both B16G and P815 antigen immunoadsorbent columns, and that scored positively with B16G in an ELISA after elution. Such reactivity could not be obtained from A10 supernatants or ascites absorbed over irrelevant columns, nor was it obtained from supernatants or ascites from other T cell hybrids that had scored B16G nonreactive in the original screening. In vivo studies indicated that affinity-purified A10 material injected into DBA/2J mice enhanced significantly the growth of P815 tumor cells, but not the growth of other DBA/2 syngeneic tumor lines such as L1210 or M-I. Additionally, this material did not inhibit the in vitro mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) between DBA/2 splenocytes and allogeneic B10.BR target cells (unlike B16G purified material from whole DBA/2 spleens, which has been demonstrated to be suppressive in this type of MLR). Biochemical analysis of this tumor-specific TsF from A10 was undertaken; the native m.w. was found to be in the region of 80,000 and 90,000.

HCMV-infected fibroblasts were lysed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells from normal seronegative individuals. The effector cells were large granular lymphocytes of Leu-7+, Leu-11+, and to a lesser extent Leu-7- phenotype. Depletion studies suggested they were the same population of NK cells that lyse uninfected fibroblasts, but a subset of NK cells that lyse K562 cells. HCMV-infected cells treated with phosphonoformate and cells infected for 16 hr that only express the nonstructural HCMV immediate early and early proteins and not the late (structural) proteins were susceptible to lysis by IFN-pretreated effector cells, whereas cells expressing immediate early antigens alone were not. This enhanced susceptibility to lysis was associated with increased effector:target binding in target cell binding assays, and was competitively inhibited by uninfected fibroblasts in cold target competition assays. It was independent of IFN release from the infected target cells or effector cells. These results suggest that the increased susceptibility to lysis by NK cells produced by a human herpes virus HCMV i) is manifest when early viral proteins are expressed, ii) is related to enhanced expression of a target structure likely to be present on uninfected fibroblasts, and iii) has a major component that is independent of IFN.","['Borysiewicz, L K', 'Rodgers, B', 'Morris, S', 'Graham, S', 'Sissons, J G']","['Borysiewicz LK', 'Rodgers B', 'Morris S', 'Graham S', 'Sissons JG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/*immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interferons/*physiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/classification/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Male', 'Virus Activation']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Apr;134(4):2695-701.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Migration into nitrocellulose filters was studied in a 2-hr assay with the use of modified Boyden chambers. LGL migrated into filters in response to casein or C5a. Migration depended on the presence of a concentration gradient of chemoattractant between the lower and upper compartment of the chambers. Percoll-purified high density small lymphocytes had little or no migratory capacity under these conditions, requiring a longer incubation time (4 hr) for consistent migration. Migratory capacity in response to stimuli correlated with the frequency of LGL in the various fractions of Percoll gradients. Fractionation of LGL-enriched Percoll preparations with monoclonal antibodies and immunoadsorbent columns or a cell sorter revealed that cells with migratory capacity in response to stimuli were B73.1+ and OKT3-, thus confirming that migrating cells were LGL. LGL preincubated with interferon (IFN) showed enhanced spontaneous motility but no increased responsiveness to chemoattractants. IFN did not modify the migratory capacity of small lymphocytes. The prompt migration of LGL in response to stimuli is consistent with the hypothesis that these cells may serve as one of the first easily mobilizable lines of resistance against infectious agents and tumors. The migration assay described here may offer a better insight into the functions and regulation of LGL.","['Bottazzi, B', 'Introna, M', 'Allavena, P', 'Villa, A', 'Mantovani, A']","['Bottazzi B', 'Introna M', 'Allavena P', 'Villa A', 'Mantovani A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Caseins)', '0 (Complement C5)', '65455-52-9 (Percoll)', '7631-86-9 (Silicon Dioxide)', '80295-54-1 (Complement C5a)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'FZ989GH94E (Povidone)']",IM,"['Caseins/pharmacology', 'Cell Separation', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects', 'Collodion', 'Complement C5/pharmacology', 'Complement C5a', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Filtration/instrumentation', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Povidone', 'Silicon Dioxide']",1985/04/01 00:00,1985/04/01 00:01,['1985/04/01 00:00'],"['1985/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1985 Apr;134(4):2316-21.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds undergo addition-elimination reactions with thiols and other nucleophilic groups under physiological conditions and form an addition product with glutathione. Thymine- and adenine-N1-propenals inhibit DNA synthesis in HeLa cells; both compounds are cytotoxic [50% inhibiting concentration (IC50) = 1 to 2 microM]. A structurally related nucleoside, thymidine-N3-propenal, designed as a metabolic pathway inhibitor, inhibits growth of HeLa, L1210 leukemia, Lewis lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma, and DLD-1 human colon carcinoma cells in culture (IC50 = 1 to 6 microM). A single injection of this compound, administered on the first day following transplant of L1210 leukemia cells, increased the mean survival time of mice by 50% (T/C = 154). Thymidine-N3-propenal selectively blocks DNA synthesis in HeLa cells and inhibits thymidine kinase (Ki = 5.1 microM) and DNA polymerase-alpha. We suggest that base propenals, rather than damaged DNA, account for some of the cytotoxic effects of bleomycin and that nucleoside propenals represent a novel class of site-directed inhibitors.","['Grollman, A P', 'Takeshita, M', 'Pillai, K M', 'Johnson, F']","['Grollman AP', 'Takeshita M', 'Pillai KM', 'Johnson F']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nucleic Acids)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', ""85394-19-0 (3-(thymin-1'-yl)-2-propenal)"", '90029-85-9 (3-(3-oxoprop-2-enyl)thymidine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bleomycin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase II/antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Nucleic Acids/biosynthesis', 'Thymidine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Mar;45(3):1127-31.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['CA17395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Cultures were tested for production of total nonadherent granulocytes and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells (GM-CFUc); virus replication by supernatant reverse transcriptase activity; percentage of adherent and nonadherent cells and GM-CFUc that released virus by infectious center assay; and for synthesis of Harvey ras p21 protein. High-efficiency, stable Am-MuLV infection of over 90% of human marrow-culture nonadherent and adherent cells and both seven- and 14-day GM-CFUc were detected as Kirsten or Harvey pseudotype virus release by infectious center assay. Synthesis of Harvey ras p21 was detected in the adherent and nonadherent cell populations of human as well as mouse continuous marrow cultures infected with Kirsten or Harvey pseudotype virus. In contrast to data with mouse cultures, cumulative production of GM-CFUc and differentiated granulocytes in human cultures was not detectably altered by Harvey or Kirsten virus infection, and all cultures ceased to produce hematopoietic cells by 20 weeks. Of 54 virus-infected cultures in ten separate experiments, 13 produced a second peak of nonadherent cells (greater than 10(5) per flask) after 20 weeks, significantly more frequently than did control uninfected cultures (one of 32). When subcultured, these harvests produced permanent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed pre-B cell lines that released the original inoculating pseudotype virus. Thus, Am-MuLV is a potentially valuable vector for inserting genetic sequences by recombinant techniques into human hematopoietic and stromal cells in culture; however, activation of EBV may be a significant complication.","['Rothstein, L', 'Pierce, J H', 'Klassen, V', 'Greenberger, J S']","['Rothstein L', 'Pierce JH', 'Klassen V', 'Greenberger JS']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Adhesion', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Retroviridae', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine', 'Virus Replication']",1985/03/01 00:00,1985/03/01 00:01,['1985/03/01 00:00'],"['1985/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1985 Mar;65(3):744-52.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)83651-9 [pii]'],"['P01 CA-12662/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-25412/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

BDF1 mice bearing L1210 ascites cells were injected intraperitoneally with [14C]FUra, 100 mg/kg. The time course of F-RNA levels in L1210 cells was determined by following the radiolabeled drug, and by NaB3H4 labeling of isolated and derivatized nucleoside. RNA ribonucleotides were obtained by KOH hydrolysis of perchloric acid precipitates of cell sonicates. FUMP nucleotides were separated from remaining nucleotides by DEAE-cellulose chromatography. FUMP fractions were treated with alkaline phosphatase, and FUrd was separated from non-FUrd nucleoside contaminants by additional DEAE-cellulose chromatography. FUrd was quantitated by periodate oxidation of ribose and NaB3H4 reduction of the resulting nucleoside dialdehydes. Isolation of tritiated FUrd-trialcohol from remaining tissue contaminants and background radioactivity was done by silica gel thin layer chromatography. Comparison of results obtained by isolation of [14C]FUrd with results of NaB3H4 labeling of the same samples showed parallel results with comparable biological standard deviations, although the tritium method consistently gave slightly lower values. The peak level of F-RNA at 3 hr was 1 base substitution per 174 normal nucleotides. The level of F-RNA after 3 hr declined slowly, so that at 96 hr there still remained 1 FUra base per 597 normal nucleotides. Serial determinations of RNA content showed marked decreases, on the basis of either DNA or protein level, that continued up to 96 hr after FUra administration. These biochemical effects are among the most prolonged reported for FUra, suggesting the possibility that F-RNA represents a storage compartment for release of toxic metabolites and emphasize the need for additional study of RNA effects at long time points. Our method for assay of F-RNA appears to be suitable for study of biopsy specimens of tumors and normal tissues following nonradiolabeled-FUra administration.","['Spears, C P', 'Shani, J', 'Shahinian, A H', 'Wolf, W', 'Heidelberger, C', 'Danenberg, P V']","['Spears CP', 'Shani J', 'Shahinian AH', 'Wolf W', 'Heidelberger C', 'Danenberg PV']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'DNA/analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'RNA/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1985 Feb;27(2):302-7.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,"['CA27,610/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

This molecule, termed minus-strand strong-stop DNA, is then translocated to the 3' end of the viral RNA by means of a repeated sequence, the R region, present at both ends of the template. The translocation should result in the transfer of genetic information from the 5' R region to the 3' R region. We have generated a series of mutants of Moloney murine leukemia virus with alterations in the R regions by in vitro mutagenesis of a cloned DNA copy of the viral genome. The altered DNAs were introduced into mouse cells by transfection, and the translocation of the mutations during viral replication was assessed. Some mutations were not transferred from the 5' R region to the 3' R region; these results were not in accord with current models for reverse transcription. The results can be explained if DNA molecules shorter than strong-stop DNA, formed by premature termination of synthesis, are sometimes translocated. A number of mutants with large deletions in the R region were tested and were able to replicate with normal strong-stop DNA translocation. Thus, short stretches of homology can be used by the virus to carry out strong-stop translocations.","['Lobel, L I', 'Goff, S P']","['Lobel LI', 'Goff SP']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', '*Genes, Viral', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1985 Feb;53(2):447-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.53.2.447-455.1985.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.53.2.447-455.1985 [doi]'],,PMC254656,,,['GENBANK/K02854'],,,,,

Interestingly, these epitopes all belong to the same cluster defined on HLA class I molecules, but differ from one HTA subset to another. These results would therefore suggest that HTA and HLA class I antigens display a limited structural homology, but have a conserved epitopic area whose detailed structure differs for each HTA subset. Furthermore, the cell surface expression of each HTA class I molecule type is differently enhanced by natural interferon (IFN)-alpha or -gamma.

YT cells were tetraploid, having 4q+ chromosomal markers, and proliferated continuously in vitro without conditioned medium (CM) or IL 2. They were weakly positive for OKT9, OKT11, and Tac antigen (Ag), a determinant closely associated with the receptor for IL 2 (IL 2-R), and were negative for OKT1, OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 Ag. YT cells also expressed HNK-1 Ag and Fc receptors for IgG, which are expressed on natural killer (NK) cells. They retained a killing activity against human cell lines, including K562 (myeloid), T, and B cell lines. Unlike Tac Ag/IL 2-R(+) cell lines derived from adult T cell leukemia (ATL), YT cells were negative for HTLV, as proved by Southern blotting with cDNA for viral DNA. The expression of Tac Ag was markedly enhanced in 18 hr, when YT cells were incubated with CM from PHA-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) or spleen cells, as determined by immunofluorescence by using flow cytometry and binding assay with 125I-anti-Tac antibody (Ab). The binding study with 125I-labeled recombinant IL 2 showed 3.2 X 10(4) IL 2 receptor sites on YT cells precultured with CM. PHA-P and Con A neither agglutinate nor enhance the expression of IL 2-R/Tac antigen on these non-T cell line cells. Furthermore, neither recombinant IL 2 nor gamma-interferon could induce IL 2-R on YT cells, suggesting the presence of a unique IL 2-R inducing factor in PBL or spleen CM. Unlike Tac Ag on HTLV(+), ATL-derived cell lines (Hut-102, MT-1, ATL-2), the expression of Tac Ag on YT cells was down-regulated by anti-Tac Ab.

This effect was confirmed by the detection of HLA class I antigens on the cell membrane with specific monoclonal antibodies, by immuneprecipitation, and by isolation of specific HLA ABC messenger RNA, in the induced cells.

Because leukemic cells can be considered as a model representing certain stages of normal hemopoietic differentiation, the expression of HLA antigens on K562 cells induced to differentiate could be interpreted as an event related to the process of differentiation itself.

Morphological and immunohistochemical differences between European and HTLV-positive Japanese T-cell lymphomas.,65-72,"A total of 56 cases of malignant lymphoma presumed to be of peripheral T-cell origin were investigated with regard to histological and immunohistochemical features. The goal of the study was to determine whether virus-associated T-cell lymphomas can be morphologically or immunohistochemically distinguished from presumably virus-negative T-cell lymphomas. The cases came from endemic and non-endemic regions of Japan, the United Kingdom (including 4 Caribbean cases) and the Federal Republic of Germany. Sera of all Japanese and Caribbean patients and 8 German patients were tested for antibodies to adult T-cell leukaemia virus-associated antigen HTLV-A. In all cases sections were examined blind by 5 well-trained histopathologists. In most cases cryostat sections could be prepared from fresh tissue specimens and stained with a large panel of monoclonal antibodies. All HTLV-A-positive cases were morphologically classifiable as the pleomorphic type of T-cell lymphoma. Approximately 70% of the tested cases of pleomorphic T-cell lymphoma, however, showed a positive serum reaction for HTLV-A. All other types of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (T-immunoblastic lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia of T type, T-zone lymphoma, ""AILD type"" and lymphoepithelioid cell lymphoma) were HTLV-A-negative and mostly observed in European patients. Thus virus-associated T-cell lymphomas appear to be invariably of the pleomorphic type; but pleomorphism is not specific to HTLV-A-positive cases. This was also evident from the results of an experiment in which 2 Japanese histopathologists attempted to recognize HTLV-A positivity in a blind study of pleomorphic T-cell lymphomas. A maximum of about 80% of cases were correctly identified, with about 10% false-positive diagnoses (in HTLV-A-negative or presumably negative cases) and 10% false-negative diagnoses. The immunohistochemical analysis revealed not only many common features but also 2 distinct differences between HTLV-A-positive and -negative T-cell lymphomas. All but one of the HTLV-A-positive cases showed reactivity with anti-Tac and all cases in the virus-positive group were negative for TU14. All other cases were Tac-negative and approximately 65% of these cases exhibited reactivity with TU14. Preliminary cytogenetic observations suggest that there are also differences in specific chromosome aberrations.","['Lennert, K', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Sato, E', 'Suchi, T', 'Stansfeld, A G', 'Feller, A C', 'Hansmann, M L', 'Muller-Hermelink, H K', 'Godde-Salz, E']","['Lennert K', 'Kikuchi M', 'Sato E', 'Suchi T', 'Stansfeld AG', 'Feller AC', 'Hansmann ML', 'Muller-Hermelink HK', 'Godde-Salz E']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology', 'Europe', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Japan', 'Lymphoma/classification/immunology/*pathology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Staining and Labeling', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'West Indies']",1985/01/15 00:00,1985/01/15 00:01,['1985/01/15 00:00'],"['1985/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1985 Jan 15;35(1):65-72. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910350111.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),,['10.1002/ijc.2910350111 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Spleen cells, obtained from M-MuLV/M-MSV regressor mice, were restimulated in bulk secondary mixed leucocyte-tumour cell cultures (MLTC), and subsequently plated in a culture medium supplemented with two different supernatants (SN) produced following PMA-stimulation of the same EL-4 thymoma cell line. SN 20, obtained from the cell line maintained in vitro, contained IL-2 and only negligible amounts (less than 3 U/ml) of interferon (IFN), while SN 19, obtained after passage of the ascitic form of EL-4 thymoma in syngeneic mice, contained both IL-2 and IFN in high titres. The frequency of CTL-p specific for MBL-2 lymphoma cells was high and comparable in cultures supplemented with both SN (1/2 X 84 cells and 1/2 X 40 cells, respectively), while the frequency of CTL-p directed against NK-susceptible YAC-1 target cells was low in SN 20 (1/90 cells) and high in SN 19 (1/5 X 40 cells). An analysis of individual microcultures established at low cell dose (1 cell/well) indicated that specific and NK-like activity could be ascribed to the same precursor cells. Furthermore, using different long-term CTL clones, we observed that, after passage in SN 20, double-reactive clones gradually lose the capacity to lyse NK-susceptible targets, while most of MBL-2 specific clones acquired NK-like activity following a few passages in SN 19. Therefore, the induction of NK-like activity is reversible and may be modulated by soluble factors present in supernatant in which CTL clones are maintained. Double-reactive clones were unable to lyse NK-resistant allogeneic tumour cells or normal syngeneic blast cells. A few clones cross-reacting with H-2d alloantigens also exhibited NK-like activity when maintained in SN 19. The different pattern of CTL clone activity was associated with a morphological change in the clones themselves: the acquisition of double activity was accompanied by an increase in cell size and the appearance of numerous cytoplasmic granules. All CTL clones were phenotypically Thy-1+ and Lyt-2+ on indirect immunofluorescence and complement-dependent cytotoxicity investigation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Ronchese, F', 'Collavo, D', 'Zanovello, P', 'Cerundolo, V', 'Biasi, G']","['Ronchese F', 'Collavo D', 'Zanovello P', 'Cerundolo V', 'Biasi G']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Lyt antibodies)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interferons/analysis', 'Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Isoantibodies/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Viruses']",1985/02/01 00:00,1985/02/01 00:01,['1985/02/01 00:00'],"['1985/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1985 Feb;54(2):265-74.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,,,PMC1453485,,,,,,,,

We have shown previously that histamine-secreting rat basophilic leukaemia cells (RBL-2H3), which degranulate on aggregation of the receptors for immunoglobulin IgE, contain a Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (kinase C). The partially purified enzyme is activated directly by the tumour-promoting phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). In intact RBL cells, TPA potentiates histamine release induced by the Ca2+-ionophore A23187 (similar to the synergy reported for platelets, neutrophils and rat peritoneal mast cells). Although TPA at concentrations below 15 nM synergizes with the antigen, higher TPA concentrations inhibit secretion. This selective inhibition suggested that kinase C is involved in both the activation and termination of the secretory process. To examine this possibility, we have determined the effect of TPA on changes in free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration during antigen-induced release. We report here that TPA completely blocks the increase in Ca2+ concentration induced by antigen. Our results strongly suggest that protein kinase C is involved in the regulation of receptor-dependent Ca2+ signalling.","['Sagi-Eisenberg, R', 'Lieman, H', 'Pecht, I']","['Sagi-Eisenberg R', 'Lieman H', 'Pecht I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Basophils/*physiology', 'Calcium/*physiology', '*Histamine Release', 'Ion Channels/physiology', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C', 'Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen/physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1985/01/03 00:00,1985/01/03 00:01,['1985/01/03 00:00'],"['1985/01/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/03 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1985 Jan 3-9;313(5997):59-60. doi: 10.1038/313059a0.,0028-0836 (Print) 0028-0836 (Linking),,['10.1038/313059a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

After a 30-min exposure to 5 microM [3H]7-OH-MTX, three different polyglutamyl derivatives were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography. When extracellular 7-OH-MTX was removed, the 7-OH-MTX diglutamate level declined slowly in comparison to the monoglutamate, but the higher polyglutamyl derivative levels increased. Within 10 min after exposure of cells to 7-OH-MTX, the level of these polyglutamyl derivatives far exceeds the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity. Gel filtration or charcoal binding analysis followed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the bound component showed intracellular binding of virtually all 7-OH-MTX tetraglutamate at a level 4-fold higher than that of the dihydrofolate reductase binding capacity. No bound 7-OH-MTX diglutamate or triglutamate could be detected. Treatment of the 7-OH-MTX tetraglutamate: protein complex with 100 microM unlabeled methotrexate (MTX) for 15 min resulted in only a partial dissociation of this complex to an extent compatible with the dihydrofolate reductase level. The residual 7-OH-MTX tetraglutamate remained bound to a site with a molecular weight of approximately 25,000 to 35,000 as assessed by Bio-Gel P-60 analysis and could not be displaced by folic acid, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate, 7-OH-MTX, or the tetraglutamate of MTX. 7-OH-MTX and MTX cytotoxicities were compared by clonogenic assay in agar and by their effects on cell growth. After a 2-hr exposure, the 50% inhibitory concentrations for 7-OH-MTX and MTX in cells growing in agar were 10(-5) and 10(-6) M, respectively. A 10-fold difference in cytotoxicity was also observed in cells growing in suspension. Continuous exposure to glycine: adenosine: thymidine completely protects cells from a sustained exposure to 7-OH-MTX over the entire period of clonal growth. However, even a brief exposure to 7-OH-MTX also requires continuous exposure to glycine: adenosine: thymidine for protection. This suggests that, as observed for MTX, the 7-OH-MTX polyglutamyl derivatives that are retained within the cells have a sustained cytotoxic effect after the monoglutamate is removed.","['Fabre, G', 'Goldman, I D']","['Fabre G', 'Goldman ID']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', 'X019Z9S1DL (7-hydroxymethotrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/toxicity', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/toxicity', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jan;45(1):80-5.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['CA-16906/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

We have reexamined the mechanism of this interaction in view of recent data demonstrating the importance of MTX metabolism to polyglutamate derivatives (MTXPGs) in the cytotoxic effects of the antifolate. After a 3-hr exposure to 0.5 microM MTX, 67% of intracellular drug was in the form of MTXPGs containing a total of 2 to 5 glutamyl residues (MTX-Glu2-5), and cloning efficiency in drug-free medium was only 7% of untreated control. After a 3-hr pretreatment with E. coli Asnase (0.1 unit/ml), [3H]thymidine incorporation dropped by 29%, MTXPG formation during subsequent MTX exposure decreased by more than one-half (MTX-Glu2 unchanged; MTX-Glu3 and 4 decreased to 51.7 and 18.5% of levels achieved in cells not pretreated with Asnase; no MTX-Glu5 formed), and cloning efficiency increased to 71% of untreated control. This effect was not due to decreased MTX uptake into L5178Y cells or to decreased intracellular free L-glutamate or L-glutamine levels. A 3-hr exposure of L5178Y cells to media lacking L-isoleucine, an essential amino acid for cell growth, prior to MTX exposure inhibited [3H]thymidine incorporation by 37%, decreased subsequent MTXPG formation by 62%, and increased subsequent cloning in drug-free medium to control levels. Decreased MTXPG formation was responsible for the prevention of MTX cytotoxicity seen after both pretreatments. Unmetabolized MTX rapidly left L5178Y cells after removal of extracellular MTX. Consequently, lower levels of unbound intracellular drug, a prerequisite of drug activity, were maintained in pretreated than in control cells after passage in drug-free medium. Asnase pretreatment protects L5178Y cells from the cytotoxic effects of MTX, possibly through inhibition of cell growth which nonspecifically decreases MTXPG formation.","['Jolivet, J', 'Cole, D E', 'Holcenberg, J S', 'Poplack, D G']","['Jolivet J', 'Cole DE', 'Holcenberg JS', 'Poplack DG']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Peptides)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '3KX376GY7L (Glutamic Acid)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Asparagine/analysis', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Glutamates/analysis', 'Glutamic Acid', 'Glutamine/analysis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Mice', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jan;45(1):217-20.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a variant of P388 leukemia resistant to acivicin (P388/ACIA) and compared its properties with those of the parent line (P388/S). An examination of the enzymes utilizing L-glutamine revealed that the basal specific activities of L-asparagine synthetase and L-glutaminase were 1-to 3-fold higher in the parent line. The activities of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase II, L-asparagine synthetase, formylglycinamide ribonucleotide amidotransferase, and guanosine monophosphate synthetase were about equally inhibited in the two cell lines, while there was a partial inhibition of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate amidotransferase, fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase, and L-glutaminase activities, found only in the sensitive line. Cytidine triphosphate synthetase activity was not inhibited in either line. There was no difference in the dose response or restitution of L-glutamine utilizing enzyme activities between the two lines. Acivicin treatment produced a 2- to 3-fold augmentation of the L-glutamine pools only in the sensitive line. Drug injection induced increased 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate levels in both lines. Acivicin perturbed guanosine nucleotide pools only in the sensitive line, indicating that the primary mechanism of action of acivicin in P388 leukemia may be directed at guanosine monophosphate synthetase. Transport studies demonstrated a restricted uptake of acivicin by the resistant cells. These studies suggest that the transport of acivicin and L-glutamine plays an important role in determining the sensitivity or resistance to acivicin in these tumors.","['Jayaram, H N', 'Ardalan, B', 'Deas, M', 'Johnson, R K']","['Jayaram HN', 'Ardalan B', 'Deas M', 'Johnson RK']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Isoxazoles)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '7540-64-9 (Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate)', 'O0X60K76I6 (acivicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genetic Variation', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Isoxazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oxazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Phosphoribosyl Pyrophosphate/metabolism']",1985/01/01 00:00,1985/01/01 00:01,['1985/01/01 00:00'],"['1985/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1985/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1985/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1985 Jan;45(1):207-12.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

In all cases, the labeled protein immunoprecipitated with the anti-IL 1 antibodies exhibited a m.w. of 33,000 on SDS gels. This 33,000 m.w. protein was not an aggregate of low m.w. IL 1. Addition of excess purified low m.w. IL 1 completely blocked the immunoprecipitation of the 33,000 m.w. protein. When cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine for 1 to 5 hr and then incubated in medium containing unlabeled methionine for 19 hr, labeled low m.w. IL 1 was detected in the culture fluid. If cells were pulsed with [35S]methionine to label the 33,000 m.w. protein and then incubated in the presence of a maximally effective concentration of the protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, the low m.w.

Using an in vitro dissolution test, near zero-order release rate was observed over a period of about 35 days. The amount of drug released by the 'burst phenomenon' was found to be less than the HCFU toxic dose. In vivo studies of antitumor activity were carried out by measuring the lifespan of lymphoma-inoculated mice (ILS).

We therefore surveyed a number of human leukemic cell lines for expression of homeobox-containing genes by Northern gel analysis with probes from the Hox 2 cluster of homeobox genes on chromosome 17. We observed transcripts for Hox 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.6 in the erythroid line HEL and for Hox 2.3 and 2.6 in the erythroid line K562. Using homeobox-specific probes we confirmed that the transcripts visualized contained the homeodomains for each gene as well as the flanking sequences. The myeloid lines HL60, KG1 and U937 did not express specific transcripts for any of the 4 genes studied. However, all these cell lines demonstrated bands when probed at low stringency with certain Hox 2 probes, indicating the expression of other homologous but as yet unidentified homeobox genes. Expression of Hox 2.3 and 2.6 was seen in some T and B lymphoid cell lines. Induction of differentiation in HEL cells resulted in complex modulation of expression of the Hox 2 genes. We have therefore observed erythroid-restricted expression of certain Hox 2 homeobox containing genes in human erythroid cell lines and modulation of that expression with differentiation, suggesting a role for these genes in the regulation of hematopoiesis. Different homeobox genes appear to be expressed in non-erythroid leukemic cell lines.","['Shen, W F', 'Largman, C', 'Lowney, P', 'Hack, F M', 'Lawrence, H J']","['Shen WF', 'Largman C', 'Lowney P', 'Hack FM', 'Lawrence HJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, Davis School of Medicine, Martinez.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Probes', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1989;271:211-9. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-0623-8_22.,0065-2598 (Print) 0065-2598 (Linking),,['10.1007/978-1-4613-0623-8_22 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['Hox 2'],,

A progressively DOX-resistant (10- and 40-fold) L1210 mouse leukemia model system, which does not exhibit enhanced DOX efflux as a primary mechanism of resistance, was found to display the MDR phenotype, based on overexpression of P-glycoprotein in western blots and cross-resistance to vinca alkaloids. Cross-resistance to another topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide (VP-16), was similar to that of DOX (10- and 40-fold), whereas resistance to N-[4-(9-acridinylamino)-3-methoxyphenyl]methanesulfonamide (m-AMSA) was 5-fold lower. In contrast, no cross-resistance to camptothecin, an inhibitor of topoisomerase I, was observed. Topoisomerase II decatenation activity in nuclear extracts from 10- and 40-fold DOX-resistant cells was 2- and 4-fold lower, respectively, when compared to sensitive cells. In these cells, however, marked reductions in m-AMSA- and VP-16-induced topoisomerase II mediated DNA cleavage were found to exceed decreases in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Results from this study demonstrated that, in progressively DOX-resistant L1210 mouse leukemia cells with the MDR phenotype, a better relation existed between the degree of resistance and reduced VP-16- and m-AMSA-induced topoisomerase II mediated DNA cleavage, than between increases in P-glycoprotein and concomitant reduction in DOX accumulation.","['Ganapathi, R', 'Grabowski, D', 'Ford, J', 'Heiss, C', 'Kerrigan, D', 'Pommier, Y']","['Ganapathi R', 'Grabowski D', 'Ford J', 'Heiss C', 'Kerrigan D', 'Pommier Y']","['Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, OH 44195.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Phenotype', 'Simian virus 40', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(4):217-24.,0955-3541 (Print) 0955-3541 (Linking),,,['CA-35531/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The sublines isolated for in vitro studies were AZQ19 and AZQ30 which corresponded to the 19th and 30th in vivo passages, respectively. The AZQ19 subline displayed a very low degree of resistance to AZQ (1.5-fold), whereas the AZQ30 subline was sensitive. Both sublines, however, had much higher degrees of resistance to Adriamycin than to AZQ (24-fold for AZQ30 cells and 10-fold for AZQ19 cells). Both cell lines were also more resistant to actinomycin D, colchicine, and vincristine than to AZQ. The AZQ19 line was resistant to the alkylator thio-TEPA to the same degree that it was to AZQ, but the AZQ30 line was sensitive to thio-TEPA. On the other hand, AZQ30 cells were resistant to hydrogen peroxide with a very low degree of resistance (1.27-fold, P less than 0.05), whereas the AZQ19 line was sensitive. Drug accumulation experiments indicated that AZQ-resistant cells differed from the parental line in that they did not accumulate Adriamycin or vinblastine. In the case of AZQ, however, resistant and parental lines accumulated the same amounts of exchangeable AZQ. Using the immunoblotting technique, no P-glycoprotein was found in resistant cells. The resistant lines consumed oxygen at greater rates than the parental line. Oxygen consumption (Mean +/- SD) in sensitive cells was 2.0 +/- 0.4% O2 consumed/min, whereas in resistant cells it was nearly 3.1 +/- 0.6% O2 consumed/min. The increase in oxygen consumption with drug resistance was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). The kinetics of production of hydroxyl free radicals and of AZQ free radicals were faster in the resistant lines reflecting, in essence, their increased oxygen consumption. It appears that the two sublines analyzed here show resistance mechanisms that may have been elicited by the two distinct chemical constituents of AZQ. Therefore, in the AZQ19-resistant line, the alkylating aspect of AZQ was emphasized, whereas in the AZQ30 line, the quinone and, thus, free radical aspect was emphasized. This is consistent with AZQ30 cells being sensitive to the alkylator thio-TEPA and resistant to hydrogen peroxide, and the AZQ19 line being resistant to thio-TEPA and sensitive to hydrogen peroxide. In addition, the AZQ30 cell line was relatively more resistant than the AZQ19 line to Adriamycin.","['Gutierrez, P L', 'Wilder, P J', 'Biswal, N']","['Gutierrez PL', 'Wilder PJ', 'Biswal N']","['Division of Developmental Therapeutics, University of Maryland Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aziridines)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Free Radicals)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'FQL5EUP13W (diaziquone)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aziridines/*pharmacology', '*Benzoquinones', 'Biological Transport', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Free Radicals', 'Genetic Variation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(3):181-90.,0955-3541 (Print) 0955-3541 (Linking),,,['CA-33681/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Today the very limited results of monoclonal antibodies in cancer treatment favors this hypothesis. The aggravation of HIV by (some) antibodies suggests that the same phenomenon may also happen in this condition. In 1957, on the other hand, we described the therapeutically beneficial cytostatic targetting effect of polyclonal antibodies, an effect which has often been quoted and widely confirmed. Does the reason for the poor results of monoclonal antibody targetting in tumor treatment reside in cancer antigen heterogeneity? This is what an experiment we conducted with Olsson on AkR leukemia indicated, suggesting that several monoclonals should be simultaneously combined for most patients, to be determined by the antigenic study not only of each tumor but of each localisation. We shifted our cancer immunotherapy approach to an adoptive form in 1959; a), after establishing partial and transient, then total and permanent allogeneic marrow graft and chimerism in man; b), after describing the graft versus leukemia (GvL) action of the graft versus host (GvH) effect in leukaemic mice; c), and the same phenomenon in humans. Our observations on human allogeneic grafted bone marrow GvH and GvL were statistically confirmed in 1979 by the Seattle group. In the 1970s we attempted to induce strong GvL with weak GvH by replacing allogeneic bone marrow graft by allogeneic lymphocyte transfusions without host conditioning. Remarkable results were registered in mice, and in patients with acute leukaemia--5 complete remissions out of 7 patients who developed moderate GvH, and only 3 out of 70 in those who did not develop GvH. As we now know that CD4-, CD8+ lymphocytes are not all MHCl-restricted, we consider that the allogeneic CTL approach is worth trying as reinforcement treatment of (at least) severe hematopoietic malignancies. If it is indeed worthwhile in some severe neoplasias to include the adoptive form of immunotherapy in the multi-treatment program, the replacement of the patient's bone marrow by engrafted allogeneic stem cells has not been proven necessary, as the persistence in ""ALL cured"" chemotherapy patients of abnormally differentiated cells does not reduce the expectancy of cure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Mathe, G']",['Mathe G'],"[""Institut du Cancer et d'Immunogenetique, Immunitaires et Tumorales, Hopital Paul-Brousse, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology/prevention & control/surgery/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/surgery/*therapy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1989;43(8):551-61. doi: 10.1016/0753-3322(89)90032-2.,0753-3322 (Print) 0753-3322 (Linking),,"['0753-3322(89)90032-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0753-3322(89)90032-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,112,,,

Combination chemotherapy and aggressive treatments may offer some advantages: however, these approaches do not appear to produce stable suppression of Ph1 chromosome or to prolong chronic phase and survival of these patients. Only allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been demonstrated to be capable of inducing a stable, complete suppression of Ph1+ cells. Recently alpha Interferons (IFN) have been shown to control myeloid proliferation in patients with CML and to determine a progressive and persistent decline of Ph1+ bone marrow cells in some cases. The hypothesis that in most newly diagnosed patients with CML various amount of Ph1 negative cells must still be present, albeit in suppressed state in the bone marrow (BM) or in the peripheral blood (PB), have led some Authors to treat patients with high-dose chemotherapy followed by reinfusion of stem cells collected at diagnosis or after a response to cytoreductive treatments.

The cDNA pCA12-2 was identified as the 3'-part of P-glycoprotein cDNA by dideoxy sequencing. By using the cDNA probe, expression of P-glycoprotein mRNA was examined in human gastric xenograft lines transplanted in nude mice and clinical samples of human gastric normal tissues and tumors. Five gastric tumor xenograft lines expressed low but significant levels of P-glycoprotein mRNA. The extent of expression was higher in some cases than that observed for R1-3, a weakly drug-resistant subline of K562. Normal gastric tissues from three patients expressed similar levels of P-glycoprotein mRNA and the extent of expression was slightly higher than that of R1-3. Two of three gastric tumor samples expressed higher levels of mRNA than normal gastric tissues. These results suggest that the intrinsic insensitivity of human gastric cancers to chemotherapy could be partly explained by the expression of P-glycoprotein.","['Sugimoto, Y', 'Asami, N', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Sugimoto Y', 'Asami N', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA Probes', 'Doxorubicin', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Gastric Mucosa/metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Oct;80(10):993-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01639.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01639.x [doi]'],,PMC5917879,,,,,,,,

The relative resistance index to various drugs was calculated by dividing the 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the test cell line by IC50 of K562, which was the negative control in the antibody experiment. MRK16-F(ab')2 reacted with four cell lines, K562/ADM, KYO-1, HEL and CMK, which had relative resistance index values of 2 or more to vincristine (VCR), vindesine, vinblastine, ADM, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone (MIT), etoposide (VP-16) and actinomycin-D (ACT-D). The level of resistance to VCR and ADM in these cell lines decreased significantly in the presence of 10 microM verapamil in vitro. Significant expression of mRNA of P-gp gene was also detected in K562/ADM, KYO-1 and HEL. MRK16-F(ab')2 did not react with 36 other cell lines. Among them, three cell lines, PL-21, P31/FUJ and KOPM-28, had relative resistance index values of 2 or more to anthracyclines, MIT and VP-16, but not to vinca alkaloids or ACT-D. The level of ADM-resistance in these cell lines did not decrease significantly in the presence of 10 microM verapamil. Five cell lines, ATL-1K, HL-60, KMOE-2, ML-1 and U266, had relative resistance index values of 2 or more to some of the drugs, but not to the others, and 19 other cell lines did not.

With one exception (the TL2-9 cell line), these cells showed common characteristics: 1) an efficient adenylate cyclase system; 2) increased cyclic AMP production in response to at least one type of neurotransmitter, i.e., to the catecholamine isoproterenol and/or the neuropeptide VIP; 3) on the basis of adenylate cyclase stimulation, beta-adrenoceptors were of the beta 2 subtype and VIP receptors were of a ""helodermin-preferring"" subtype previously encountered in a human T lymphoblast cell line. Although we analyzed only a limited number of cell lines, it appeared that the immature T BL/VL3 clones responded to peptides of the VIP family with higher potency and efficacy than T helper and T cytotoxic cells. The membranes from the specific TL2-9 helper cell line were without adenylate cyclase activity in the presence of Gpp[NH]p, NaF, and GTP alone or GTP in the presence of isoproterenol or VIP. They produced cyclic AMP in the presence of Mn2+ and forskolin only, suggesting a defect in Gs as in S49 cyc- mouse lymphosarcoma cells. This was further demonstrated by the absence of cholera toxin-stimulated ADP-ribosylation in TL2-9 membranes.","['Robberecht, P', 'Abello, J', 'Damien, C', 'de Neef, P', 'Vervisch, E', 'Hooghe, R', 'Christophe, J']","['Robberecht P', 'Abello J', 'Damien C', 'de Neef P', 'Vervisch E', 'Hooghe R', 'Christophe J']","['Department of Biochemistry and Nutrition, Medical School, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,"['0 (Adrenergic beta-Agonists)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)']",IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/*metabolism', 'Adrenergic beta-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/enzymology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/pharmacology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1989 Oct;179(4-5):422-31. doi: 10.1016/s0171-2985(89)80046-4.,0171-2985 (Print) 0171-2985 (Linking),,"['S0171-2985(89)80046-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0171-2985(89)80046-4 [doi]']",['R0I-DK-17010-12/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The role of the mdr1 gene and its product (P-glycoprotein) in this atypical pattern of multidrug resistance has now been investigated. Southern and Northern analyses failed to demonstrate any amplification, rearrangement or over-expression of the mdr1 gene in the drug-resistant cells. Similarly, monoclonal antibodies MRK16 and JSB1 revealed no increase in the amount of P-glycoprotein present. By contrast, monoclonal antibody C219 detected a 170 kDa protein in all sublines, and in highest concentration in the most resistant cells.

As BLV can also infect sheep and induces pre B-cell specific tumours in these animals, we were interested in investigating whether suramin, a potent inhibitor of retrovirus-associated reverse transcriptase, may inhibit the in vivo multiplication of BLV in sheep. The sheep were infected with 4 X 10(7) leukocytes from a BLV-infected cow. The animals were maedi-visna virus-negative. Viral p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase appeared at 2 weeks and seroconversion occurred at 4 weeks after infection. Suramin was administered at 20 mg/kg/week from the 10th till the 16th week after infection. During the treatment period the expression of p24 antigen as well as the titre of anti-p24 and anti-gp51 antibodies were followed. Suramin treatment led to a significant, but transient, disappearance of p24 antigen and did not affect the titre of anti-p24 and anti-gp51 antibodies. The BLV-infected sheep may serve as a useful animal model for the investigation of retrovirus inhibitors and the evaluation of different therapeutic regimens.","['Burkhardt, H', 'Rosenthal, S', 'Rosenthal, H A', 'Karge, E', 'De Clercq, E']","['Burkhardt H', 'Rosenthal S', 'Rosenthal HA', 'Karge E', 'De Clercq E']","['Sektion Tierproduktion und Veterinarmedizin, Humboldt-Universitat, DDR, Berlin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Acta Virol,Acta virologica,0370401,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '6032D45BEM (Suramin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Retroviridae/drug effects', 'Sheep', 'Suramin/*therapeutic use']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Virol. 1989 Aug;33(4):305-13.,0001-723X (Print) 0001-723X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The material investigated consisted of two spleens resected at gastrectomy and one resected because of splenomegaly in a case of hairy cell leukaemia. The current concepts concerning the ultrastructure of the spleen were generally confirmed with the freeze-fracture technique. The sinus walls were found, as expected, to consist of closely fitting endothelial cells, which were identifiable in freeze-fracture replicas by numerous caveolae of the cell membrane. Contrary to the opinion upheld in the literature, the sinus endothelial cells were occasionally found to be connected by desmosomes or maculae adhaerentes. Corresponding to the finding of desmosomes in ultrathin sections, focal collections of intramembranous particles were observed in freeze-fracture replicas and a positive immunohistochemical reaction for desmoplakin in the sinuses was found at the light microscopic level. The view generally held in the literature that sinus endothelial cells can exhibit tight junctions was not confirmed. However, such junctions were found between vascular endothelial cells. The ring fibres of the sinuses, which are closely connected to the sinus endothelial cells through contractile fibres, apparently have various functions. Firstly, they contribute towards maintaining mechanical stability. Secondly, they represent basement membranes through which exchange occurs between the sinus endothelial cells and their surroundings. This is indicated by the caveolae and vesicles that are often found here in large numbers and in focal collections. Hairy cells exhibit no features in freeze-fracture replicas to suggest a cytogenetic relationship to interdigitating reticulum cells.","['Kaiserling, E', 'Wolburg, H', 'Banks, P']","['Kaiserling E', 'Wolburg H', 'Banks P']","['Institute of Pathology, Eberhard-Karls University, Tubingen, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch B Cell Pathol Incl Mol Pathol,"Virchows Archiv.

FVA cells are capable of enucleating in suspension culture in vitro, indicating that associations with an extracellular matrix or accessory cells are not required for enucleation to occur. The morphology of FVA cells undergoing enucleation is nearly identical to erythroblasts enucleating in vivo. The nucleus is segregated to one side of the cell and then appears to be pinched off resulting in an extruded nucleus and reticulocyte. The extruded nucleus is surrounded by an intact plasma membrane and has little cytoplasm associated with it. Newly formed reticulocytes have an irregular shape, are vacuolated and contain all cytoplasmic organelles. The spatial distribution of several cytoskeletal proteins was examined during the maturation process. Spectrin was found associated with the plasma membrane of FVA cells at all stages of maturation but was segregated entirely to the incipient reticulocyte during enucleation. Microtubules formed cages around nuclei in immature FVA cells and were found primarily in the incipient reticulocyte in cells undergoing enucleation. Reticulocytes occasionally contained microtubules, but a generalized diffuse distribution of tubulin was more common. Vimentin could not be detected at any time in FVA cell maturation. Filamentous actin (F-actin) had a patchy distribution at the cell surface in the most immature erythroblasts, but F-actin bundles could be detected as the cells matured. F-actin was found concentrated between the extruding nucleus and incipient reticulocyte in enucleating erythroblasts. Newly formed reticulocytes exhibited punctate actin fluorescence whereas extruded nuclei lacked F-actin. Addition of colchicine, vinblastine, or taxol to cultures of FVA cells did not affect enucleation. In contrast, cytochalasin D caused a complete inhibition of enucleation that could be reversed by washing out the cytochalasin D. These results demonstrate that F-actin plays a role in enucleation while the complete absence of microtubules or excessive numbers of polymerized microtubules do not affect enucleation.","['Koury, S T', 'Koury, M J', 'Bondurant, M C']","['Koury ST', 'Koury MJ', 'Bondurant MC']","['Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/drug effects/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Erythroblasts/drug effects/physiology/*ultrastructure', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Paclitaxel', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Spleen', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1989 Dec;109(6 Pt 1):3005-13. doi: 10.1083/jcb.109.6.3005.,0021-9525 (Print) 0021-9525 (Linking),,['10.1083/jcb.109.6.3005 [doi]'],"['DK31513/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 DK08027/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2115945,,,,,,,,

The critical region for these defects has been narrowed to a segment of band 11p13 between the catalase and the beta-follicle-stimulating hormone genes. In this report, we have cloned the endpoints from a WAGR patient whose large cytogenetic deletion, del(11)(p14.3::p13), does not include the catalase gene. The deletion was characterized using DNA polymorphisms and found to originate in the paternally derived chromosome 11. The distal endpoint was identified as a rearrangement of locus D11S21 in conventional Southern blots of the patient's genomic DNA, but was not detected in leukocyte DNA from either parent or in sperm DNA from the father. The proximal endpoint was isolated by cloning the junction fragment and was mapped in relation to other markers and breakpoints. It defines a new locus in 11p13-delta J, which is close to the Wilms tumor gene and the breakpoint cluster region (TCL2) of the frequent t(11;14)(p13;q11) translocation in acute T-cell leukemia. An unusual concentration of base pair substitutions was discovered at delta J, in which 9 of 44 restriction sites tested (greater than 20%) vary in the population. This property makes delta J one of the most polymorphic loci on chromosome 11 and may reflect an underlying instability that contributed to the original mutation. The breakpoint extends the genetic map of this region and provides a useful marker for linkage studies and the analysis of allelic segregation in tumor cells.","['Glaser, T', 'Driscoll, D J', 'Antonarakis, S', 'Valle, D', 'Housman, D']","['Glaser T', 'Driscoll DJ', 'Antonarakis S', 'Valle D', 'Housman D']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', '*Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Male', 'Mosaicism', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Syndrome', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Wilms Tumor/*genetics']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1989 Nov;5(4):880-93. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(89)90130-4.,0888-7543 (Print) 0888-7543 (Linking),,['10.1016/0888-7543(89)90130-4 [doi]'],"['T32 GM007753/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '2T 32 GM07753-06/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM20688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL41484/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we examined the effect of anti-allergic drugs, including Q.F.T., Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang (X.Q.L.T.), Chai-Pu-Tang (C.P.T.), baicalein and ketotifen which have been used for treatment of bronchial asthma, on human basophil growth in vitro using cord blood mononuclear cells as a basophil precursor source and conditioned medium of T cell leukemia cell line Mo as a growth factor. Two-week cultured basophil numbers identified by alcian blue-safranin staining and those histamine contents assayed fluorometrically were inhibited by Q.F.T. (1.0 mg/ml), X.Q.L.T. (0.01-1.0 mg/ml), C.P.T. (0.01-1.0 mg/ml), baicalein (1-100 microM) or ketotifen (1-100 microM) in a dose-dependent manner while low dose (0.01-0.1 mg/ml) of Q.F.T. showed an enhancing effect on the basophil growth and the histamine content. However, LTB4 or LTC4 failed in restoring the basophil growth reduced by 1 mg/ml of C.P.T. or 100 microM of ketotifen. These results suggest that anti-allergic drugs may modulate basophil growth and differentiation in vitro and/or in vivo and therefore be useful and reasonable for controlling allergic diseases including bronchial asthma.","['Tanno, Y', 'Shindoh, Y', 'Takishima, T']","['Tanno Y', 'Shindoh Y', 'Takishima T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,Am J Chin Med,The American journal of Chinese medicine,7901431,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Histamine H1 Antagonists)', '0 (SRS-A)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '49QAH60606 (baicalein)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'X49220T18G (Ketotifen)']",IM,"['Basophils/analysis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', '*Flavanones', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Histamine/analysis', '*Histamine H1 Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Ketotifen/pharmacology', 'Leukotriene B4/pharmacology', 'SRS-A/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Chin Med. 1989;17(1-2):45-50. doi: 10.1142/S0192415X89000085.,0192-415X (Print) 0192-415X (Linking),,"['S0192415X89000085 [pii]', '10.1142/S0192415X89000085 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

At high concentrations, PUFA have a cytotoxic effect on Jurkat cells. The inhibitory effect of the PUFA was not due to production of prostaglandins, and lipid peroxidation was only partly responsible. In addition to production of peroxides and aldehydes, lipid peroxidation also reduced the plasmalogen levels in these cells. The antioxidant alpha-tocopherol blocked lipid peroxidation and restored the plasmalogen levels to normal. alpha-Tocopherol did not totally restore cell proliferation although the MDA-like products in these cultures (supplemented with PUFA) were reduced to control level. Cultures supplemented with n-6 PUFA seemed to respond better to alpha-tocopherol than n-3 PUFA. This suggests that n-6 PUFA may exert their growth inhibitory effect predominantly via lipid peroxidation while different mechanisms might be operating for the n-3 PUFA.","['Chow, S C', 'Sisfontes, L', 'Bjorkhem, I', 'Jondal, M']","['Chow SC', 'Sisfontes L', 'Bjorkhem I', 'Jondal M']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Nonesterified)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '0 (Linolenic Acids)', '0 (Oleic Acids)', '0 (Plasmalogens)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '0RBV727H71 (alpha-Linolenic Acid)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '2UMI9U37CP (Oleic Acid)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/pharmacology', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Nonesterified/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Linoleic Acid', 'Linoleic Acids/pharmacology', 'Linolenic Acids/pharmacology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Oleic Acid', 'Oleic Acids/pharmacology', 'Plasmalogens/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/pharmacology', 'alpha-Linolenic Acid']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lipids. 1989 Aug;24(8):700-4. doi: 10.1007/BF02535207.,0024-4201 (Print) 0024-4201 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02535207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have applied DNA-F analysis to the detection of differences between leukemic phase and remission in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In order to identify normal and leukemic cell populations we used two molecular probes: Jeffreys' minisatellite probes 33.6 + 33.15 and M13 wild-type phage probe. Comparison of varying minisatellite fragments between remission and diagnosis/relapse was performed by Southern blot hybridization in 21 patients with AML. The results demonstrate that Southern hybridization with minisatellite probes can detect differences in DNA-fingerprints between leukemic phase and remission in 44% of AML patients. Thus differences in DNA-fingerprinting provides a new molecular marker, which can be useful in the detection of residual disease as well as in the study of the pathogenesis of AML.","['Pakkala, S', 'Helminen, P', 'Ruutu, T', 'Saarinen, U M', 'Peltonen, L']","['Pakkala S', 'Helminen P', 'Ruutu T', 'Saarinen UM', 'Peltonen L']","['Transplantation Laboratory, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(10):907-13. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90044-1.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90044-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In vitro it can infect several types of cells but transforms only human T lymphocytes. We have previously shown that HTLV-I viral particles, even when noninfectious, were able to activate human resting T lymphocytes, suggesting that this activation step may be important in the initiation of the lymphoproliferative process. In the present study, we first demonstrate that in contrast to other mitogenic stimuli, HTLV-I has the unique property to activate human resting T cells in the absence of accessory cells. We then investigate the relationship between HTLV-I-induced T-cell activation and the classical well-known pathways of activation, namely, the CD3/TCR and CD2 pathways. Competitive blocking experiments were performed in which the effects of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to the CD3/TCR complex or to the CD2 molecule were evaluated on the HTLV-I activation of T cells and compared with that obtained on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cells. It was found that anti-CD3 or -TCR MAb strongly suppress the proliferative response of T cells to PHA, but are significantly less efficient in inhibiting the activation initiated by HTLV-I. By contrast, MAb recognizing specific epitopes of the CD2 molecule inhibit the proliferative response of T cells to PHA or to HTLV-I to the same extent. The results provide evidence that HTLV-I virions interfere mainly with activation via CD2 but not via the CD3/TCR complex. Considering the earlier expression of the CD2 molecule on human T-cell precursors, these observations might be relevant to the characterization of the differentiation stage at which viral infection could interfere with the development and the maturation of T lymphocytes.","['Dodon, M D', 'Bernard, A', 'Gazzolo, L']","['Dodon MD', 'Bernard A', 'Gazzolo L']","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire, UMR30 Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique-Universite Claude Bernard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'CD2 Antigens', 'CD3 Complex', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Virion/immunology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Dec;63(12):5413-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.12.5413-5419.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.12.5413-5419.1989 [doi]'],,PMC251209,,,,,,,,

In cells exposed to 0.3 microM 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CldAdo), the intracellular concentration of CldATP reaches 2 microM within 15 min, and DNA synthesis by the cells is inhibited 90% within 30 min. At concentrations of extracellular CldAdo that inhibit DNA synthesis, there is also marked inhibition of intracellular conversion of cytidine to deoxycytidine nucleotides indicating significant intracellular inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Exposure of cells to 0.3 microM CldAdo decreases dCTP by 63% in 30 min, dATP and dTTP by 20% and dGTP by a smaller amount. Similar decreases in these pools occur when other inhibitors of ribonucleotide reductase are present at concentrations causing similar inhibition of DNA synthesis. Deoxycytidine treatment of cells inhibited by CldAdo restores dCTP and other pools, but restoration of DNA synthesis is incomplete, indicating that there is another mechanism for inhibition of DNA synthesis in addition to depletion of deoxyribonucleotide pools. This alternate mechanism is probably related to the incorporation of CldAdo into DNA that occurs despite a 25-times lower intracellular level of CldATP than dATP.","['Griffig, J', 'Koob, R', 'Blakley, R L']","['Griffig J', 'Koob R', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)']",IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cladribine', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Deoxyadenosines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 15;49(24 Pt 1):6923-8.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['R01 CA 39242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

TMQ-resistant sublines of the MOLT-3 human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line were developed and were designated as MOLT-3/TMQ200, MOLT-3/TMQ800, and MOLT-3/TMQ2500 based on degrees of resistance to TMQ. The TMQ resistance was accompanied by 5- to 7-fold increases in dihydrofolate reductase activity and markedly reduced cellular TMQ accumulation. Methotrexate accumulation was not impaired in TMQ-resistant cells. TMQ retention (efflux) was unchanged in these TMQ-resistant cells. Verapamil enhanced the TMQ accumulation in the resistant cells to the level seen in the parent cells but had no effects on the TMQ retention. These sublines were cross-resistant not only to methotrexate but also to vincristine, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and mitoxantrone. There was no cross-resistance to bleomycin or cisplatin. Resistance to vincristine, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and mitoxantrone was reversed by verapamil. TMQ resistance was only minimally reversed by verapamil and methotrexate resistance not affected at all. Both cellular accumulation and retention of vincristine and daunorubicin in the TMQ-resistant cells were markedly decreased. Verapamil enhanced both accumulation and retention of the drug. Plasma membrane fractions of the TMQ-resistant cells analyzed by urea-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by staining with Coomassie Blue revealed the presence of a distinct band with a molecular weight of 170,000. Immunoblot analysis with 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody raised against P-glycoprotein of multidrug-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells (C219) cross-reacted with the Mr 170,000 protein of the TMQ-resistant cells. These results show that the TMQ-resistant cells displayed not only decreased TMQ uptake and increased dihydrofolate reductase but also characteristics associated with a classical multidrug-resistant phenotype.

The leukemic relapse following the BMT was treated with a second BMT. This resulted in a remission of 28 months after which leukemic relapse was again diagnosed. Using conventional chemotherapy it was possible to obtain another complete remission.

Analysis of resistance associated membrane proteins and levels of mdr gene expression.,3611-9,"HL60 cells isolated for resistance to Adriamycin do not contain P-glycoprotein, as determined with immunological probes. These cells, however, are multidrug resistant and defective in the cellular accumulation of drug. In view of these findings, we have examined in greater detail certain properties of the HL60/Adr cells and have compared these properties to an HL60 drug-resistant isolate (HL60/Vinc) which contains high levels of P-glycoprotein. The results of these studies demonstrated that verapamil induces a major increase in cellular drug accumulation in both HL60/Adr and HL60/Vinc isolates. An 125I-labeled photoaffinity analog of verapamil labeled P-glycoprotein contained in membranes of HL60/Vinc cells. In contrast, this agent did not label any protein selectively associated with drug resistance in membranes of the HL60/Adr isolate. The photoactive dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker [3H]azidopine and [125I]NASV, a photoaffinity analog of vinblastine, labelled P-glycoprotein in membranes from HL60/Vinc cells, whereas in experiments with the HL60/Adr isolate there was no detectable labeling of a drug resistance associated membrane protein. Additional studies have been carried out to analyze membrane proteins of HL60/Adr cells labeled with the photoaffinity agent 8-azido-alpha-[32P]ATP (AzATP32). The results demonstrate that this agent labeled a resistance associated membrane protein of 190 kilodaltons (P190). P190 is essentially absent in membranes of drug-sensitive cells. Labeling of P190 with AzATP32 in membranes of resistant cells was blocked completely when incubations were carried out in the presence of excess unlabeled ATP. Additional studies were carried out to analyze mdr gene amplification and expression in sensitive and resistant cells. Experiments carried out with human 5',mdr1 (1.1 kb) and mdr3 (1.0 kb) cDNAs demonstrate that both of these sequences were highly amplified in the HL60/Vinc isolate. Only the mrd1 gene sequence however, was overexpressed. In contrast, there was no detectable amplification or overexpression of mdr1 or mdr3 sequences in HL60/Adr cells. The results of this study thus identify a new nucleotide binding protein which is overexpressed in membranes of HL60 cells isolated for resistance to Adriamycin. P190, which exhibits properties distinct from P-glycoprotein, possibly functions in the energy-dependent drug efflux system contained in the HL60/Adr resistant isolate.","['McGrath, T', 'Latoud, C', 'Arnold, S T', 'Safa, A R', 'Felsted, R L', 'Center, M S']","['McGrath T', 'Latoud C', 'Arnold ST', 'Safa AR', 'Felsted RL', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Gene Amplification', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Oct 15;38(20):3611-9. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90134-2.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90134-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90134-2 [doi]']","['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Using four homeobox probes from the HOX2 locus and a previously undescribed homeobox cDNA (PL1), we screened mRNAs from 18 human leukemic cell lines representing erythroid, myeloid, and T- and B-cell lineages. Complex patterns of lineage-restricted expression are observed: some are restricted to a single lineage, while others are expressed in multiple lineages. No single homeobox gene is expressed in all types of hematopoietic cells, but each cell type exhibits homeobox gene expression. HOX2.2 and -2.3 homeobox-containing cDNAs were cloned from an erythroleukemia cell (HEL) cDNA library, while the homeobox cDNA PL1 was isolated from a monocytic cell (U-937) library. Differentiation of HEL and K-562 cells with various inducers results in modulation of specific homeobox transcripts. In addition, HOX2.2 is expressed in normal bone marrow cells. We have demonstrated (i) lineage-restricted expression of five homeobox genes in erythroid and monocytic cell lines; (ii) expression of additional homeobox genes in other cell lineages (HL-60 and lymphoid cells); (iii) expression of one homeobox gene in normal marrow cells; and (iv) modulation of expression during differentiation. These data suggest that these genes play a role in human hematopoietic development and lineage commitment.","['Shen, W F', 'Largman, C', 'Lowney, P', 'Corral, J C', 'Detmer, K', 'Hauser, C A', 'Simonitch, T A', 'Hack, F M', 'Lawrence, H J']","['Shen WF', 'Largman C', 'Lowney P', 'Corral JC', 'Detmer K', 'Hauser CA', 'Simonitch TA', 'Hack FM', 'Lawrence HJ']","['Veterans Administration Medical Center, Martinez, CA 94553.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Nov;86(21):8536-40. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.21.8536.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.86.21.8536 [doi]'],['HL25408/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC298317,,,"['GENBANK/M30597', 'GENBANK/M30598', 'GENBANK/M30599']",,,,,

Numbers of cells with microtubule bundles have been found to correlate with sensitivity to taxol by clonogenic assay for several leukemic cell lines. We have found that cells with ""asters"" produced by taxol exposure are in mitosis and that cells with taxol-induced ""bundles"" are in G0/G1, S, and G2 phases. We further found that S-phase cells with microtubule bundles in both sensitive (HL60) and resistant (K562) cell lines were able to incorporate [3H]-thymidine after 4-hr exposure to taxol. As microtubule bundles and asters occur in cells of the same cell cycle phases in both lines, we conclude that the greater frequency of cells with microtubule bundles reported for sensitive cells after taxol treatment cannot result from drug exclusion nor from different effects of the drug on cell microtubules in these two leukemic lines.","['Roberts, J R', 'Rowinsky, E K', 'Donehower, R C', 'Robertson, J', 'Allison, D C']","['Roberts JR', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Donehower RC', 'Robertson J', 'Allison DC']","['Department of Surgery, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/*analysis/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Microtubules/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitosis', 'Paclitaxel', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tubulin/*metabolism']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1989 Nov;37(11):1659-65. doi: 10.1177/37.11.2572626.,0022-1554 (Print) 0022-1554 (Linking),,['10.1177/37.11.2572626 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The feasibility and safety of this procedure have now been established by several observations of rapid hematopoietic recovery following high-dose chemotherapy and autologous reinfusion of BDSCs harvested during remission. Using clonogenic assays for granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) and granulocyte erythrocyte monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GEM), we tested peripheral blood samples from 20 consecutive patients recovering from induction chemotherapy for ANLL. Results were correlated with other clinical and hematological factors in order to define optimal criteria for successful BDSC harvesting. Two different patterns of increment were observed in the number of peripheral blood progenitor cells during early recovery from chemotherapy in our patients, suggesting that a total period of 10-12 days should be covered for ideal BDSC harvesting by cytapheresis. Associated clinical factors that appear predictive for a better yield are: 1) chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and thioguanine (DAT), 2) synchronous recovery of monocytes and platelets, and 3) a good overall performance status of the patient. Complete remission status and absence of ongoing infection should also be considered when selecting patients for BDSC harvesting. No correlation was found between the number of circulating CFUs, as indicated by the clonogenic assays, and that of either My-10- or HLA-Dr-positive cells identified by immunofluorescence on the same blood samples. In this study, less than 50% of patients with newly diagnosed ANLL would have been considered good candidates for a BDSC harvesting program.","['Cantin, G', 'Marchand-Laroche, D', 'Bouchard, M M', 'Leblond, P F']","['Cantin G', 'Marchand-Laroche D', 'Bouchard MM', 'Leblond PF']","[""Centre d'Hematologie et d'Immunologie Clinique, Hopital du Saint-Sacrement, Quebec, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Blood Specimen Collection/*methods', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1989 Nov;17(10):991-6.,0301-472X (Print) 0301-472X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are no clonal assays for the earliest pluripotential cells, they can nevertheless be quantitated based on their ability to reconstitute animals with a deficient hematopoietic system. A similar understanding of the human hematopoietic system has lagged because of the lack of a suitable assay for human stem cells. Using several different approaches it has become possible to transplant human hematopoietic cells into immune-deficient mice. Since both lymphoid and myeloid cells have been engrafted, these experiments may lay the foundation for an assay for human pluripotent stem cells.

Transfused blood products also contain immune cells capable of alloreactivity against both donor graft and host. To reduce the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection, standard procedure is to irradiate all blood products with at least 1,500 rad before transfusion. We report a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia who developed graft rejection and GVHD after receiving a T-cell-depleted transplant from a serologically HLA-A, B, DR/DQ matched and mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) nonreactive unrelated donor. Cytogenetic analysis of marrow cells collected at the time of graft rejection revealed a PH1-negative female karyotype that was not consistent with donor cells. Use of specific minisatellite DNA probes (YNH 24, H-RAS, and 3' HVR) revealed the exclusive presence of third-party (neither donor nor recipient) restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLP) in both peripheral blood and marrow. Repeat RFLP analysis 3 days later showed persistence of this unique third-party banding pattern. DNA-based HLA-typing, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, also showed these cells to be derived from an individual whose HLA-DR type was distinct from donor and recipient. Together, these findings suggested the presence of a proliferating population of transfused cells possessing alloreactivity against both donor graft and host, despite prior irradiation of all blood products with 2,000 rad. Limiting dilution analysis to assess the frequency of irradiated lymphocytes able to respond to mitogen revealed an approximate 5- to 6-log reduction at 1,500 to 2,000 rad as compared with unirradiated controls. These data indicate that a small percentage of lymphocytes can survive irradiation at these doses and suggest that existing blood-product irradiation guidelines may require reassessment, especially in T-cell-depleted transplant recipients.","['Drobyski, W', 'Thibodeau, S', 'Truitt, R L', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A', 'Gorski, J', 'Jenkins, R', 'Gottschall, J', 'Ash, R C']","['Drobyski W', 'Thibodeau S', 'Truitt RL', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'Gorski J', 'Jenkins R', 'Gottschall J', 'Ash RC']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA Probes, HLA)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology/pathology', 'DNA Probes, HLA', 'Female', '*Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/pathology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2285-94.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)85018-6 [pii]'],['AI 28034/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Therefore, to supplement chemoseparation, we investigated whether MRK-16, a monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to the surface moiety of multidrug resistance-associated P-glycoprotein antigen, can eliminate drug-resistant tumor cells in the presence of rabbit complement (RC). Two doxorubicin (DOX)-resistant human myeloma tumor cell line, 8226/DOX40 (resistant to 4 x 10(-7) mol/L DOX) and 8226/DOX6 (6 x 10(-8) mol/L DOX) with high and low amounts of cell surface P-glycoprotein, respectively, and the drug-sensitive parent cell line 8226/S were used as tumor models in this study. Using the limiting dilution assay, we have shown that three cycles of treatment with 25 micrograms/mL of MRK-16 MoAb and a 1:4 final dilution of RC eliminated 2.90 +/- 0.10 logs of 8226/DOX40 cells and 1.94 +/- 0.18 logs of 8226/DOX6 cells. One and two cycles of treatment were less effective, eliminating 0.47 +/- 0.40 and 1.94 +/- 0.36 logs of 8226/DOX40 and 0.12 +/- 0.20 and 1.63 +/- 0.58 logs of 8226/DOX6 cells, respectively. The 8226/S cell growth was unaffected by one to three cycles of treatment. The cell kill was not impaired when the antibody plus complement treatment was carried out on a mixture of 8226/DOX40 or 8226/DOX6 cells with a ninefold excess of irradiated bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs). The three cycles of treatment with antibody plus complement did not adversely affect granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming unit (GM-CFU) survival in hematologically normal marrows (92.5% to 104% survival) or in myeloma patient marrows (85% to 100%). These results show that it is possible to eliminate drug-resistant myeloma tumor cell lines from the admixed human bone marrow by treatment with MRK-16 MoAb plus RC. This method could prove to be effective for elimination of other drug-resistant tumor cell lines including those of leukemia and solid tumors, and will be further useful for supplementing chemopurging, and immunopurging of bone marrow with other antitumor cell antibodies.","['Kulkarni, S S', 'Wang, Z M', 'Spitzer, G', 'Taha, M', 'Hamada, H', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Dicke, K A']","['Kulkarni SS', 'Wang ZM', 'Spitzer G', 'Taha M', 'Hamada H', 'Tsuruo T', 'Dicke KA']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Complement System Proteins/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', '*Drug Resistance', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 1;74(6):2244-51.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)85012-5 [pii]'],['CA 23077/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients were autografted electively after cytoreductive treatment with busulphan (16 mg/kg) and melphalan (60 mg/m2) and three were autografted after marrow cells from HLA-identical sibling donors had failed to engraft. In 13 patients haemopoiesis recovered; one failed to engraft and died 114 d after autografting. Two other patients became pancytopenic and received further stem cell transfusions at 3 and 40 months respectively after first autografting. One patient entered lymphoid transformation and died 14 months after autografting. Twelve patients survive at a median of 41 months (range 24-53) after autografting. Nine of the survivors have required further chemotherapy after autografting and four of the nine were electively autografted on a second occasion. Three patients surviving after autografting for 28, 43 and 53 months respectively have not required further chemotherapy. In two of these patients haemopoiesis is now predominantly Ph-negative. We conclude that autografting in chronic phase might prolong survival in some cases by reducing the size of the leukaemic stem cell population. The fact that initially successful grafts failed in two patients suggests that blood-derived stem cells may have a finite potential for self-replication.","['Brito-Babapulle, F', 'Bowcock, S J', 'Marcus, R E', 'Apperley, J', ""Th'ng, K H"", 'Dowding, C', 'Rassool, F', 'Guo, A P', 'Catovsky, D', 'Galton, D A']","['Brito-Babapulle F', 'Bowcock SJ', 'Marcus RE', 'Apperley J', ""Th'ng KH"", 'Dowding C', 'Rassool F', 'Guo AP', 'Catovsky D', 'Galton DA', 'et al.']","['Medical Research Council Leukaemia Unit, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/adverse effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1989 Sep;73(1):76-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00223.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1989.tb00223.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A high proportion of these AMLs are characterized by rearrangement of murine chromosome 2 in the C2 and/or E5-F regions, and there is evidence that these events are a direct consequence of radiation damage to multipotential hemopoietic cells. Using a combination of in situ chromosome hybridization and mRNA analyses, we show that the cytokine gene interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) is encoded in the chromosome 2 F region and is translocated in a chromosome 2---2 rearrangement in an x-ray-induced AML (N36). Also, IL-1 beta is specifically deregulated in N36 and in two other chromosome 2-rearranged AMLs but not in a fourth, which has two cytogenetically normal chromosome 2 copies. We suggest that radiation-induced specific chromosome 2 rearrangement associated with IL-1 beta deregulation may initiate murine leukemogenesis through the uncoupling of normal proliferative control mechanisms in multipotential hemopoietic cells.","['Silver, A', 'Boultwood, J', 'Breckon, G', 'Masson, W', 'Adam, J', 'Shaw, A R', 'Cox, R']","['Silver A', 'Boultwood J', 'Breckon G', 'Masson W', 'Adam J', 'Shaw AR', 'Cox R']","['Division of Radiation Oncogenesis, Medical Research Council Radiobiology Unit, Chilton, Didcot, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*radiation effects', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1989;2(4):226-32. doi: 10.1002/mc.2940020409.,0899-1987 (Print) 0899-1987 (Linking),,['10.1002/mc.2940020409 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Erythroid transcripts originated from a novel promoter upstream of exon 1, which was located more than 10 but less than 250 kilobases upstream of exon 2.

Blocking of UV female 1 rejection was abrogated by delayed administration of anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb but not anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb, indicating the involvement of CD4+ cells in only the initial phase of rejection.","['Udono, H', 'Mieno, M', 'Shiku, H', 'Nakayama, E']","['Udono H', 'Mieno M', 'Shiku H', 'Nakayama E']","['Department of Oncology, Nagasaki University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (H-Y Antigen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'H-Y Antigen/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Jul;80(7):649-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01692.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01692.x [doi]'],,PMC5917808,,,,,,,,

The stock, designated MEV (multiple ecotropic provirus), was developed by inbreeding and selection beginning with the cross of strains C58/J and AKXD-14. Eleven different murine leukemia virus (MuLV) proviruses have been fixed in the MEV/1Ty strain. Nine of these can be uniquely identified by Southern blotting of PvuII-digested DNA and probing with a cloned fragment of the ecotropic viral genome. Two proviruses had been mapped previously to chromosome 7, while single proviruses had been mapped to chromosomes 2, 9, and 11. The mapping of six additional proviruses, derived from C58/J, to chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 10, 18, and 19 is described. Another C58/J provirus was mapped to chromosome 8 and proved to be identical to the previously mapped C58v-1 virus inducibility gene of strain C58/Lw. Three dominant visible markers, hammer-toe (Hm), steel (Sl), and caracul-J (CaJ), located on chromosomes 5, 10, and 15, respectively, have been introduced onto the MEV genetic background by repeated backcrosses to provide additional linkage markers. It is estimated that approximately 50% of the genome can be screened by scoring 50 fully informative gametes from a linkage cross of the MEV-Hm, -Sl, -CaJ stock for the combination of viral and visible markers. A strategy for efficiently mapping new recessive visible mutations by pooling tissues for DNA extraction from mutant homozygotes among F2 progeny is described. Ways of further improving the MEV stock are discussed. The location of the Myb proto-oncogene is defined relative to Sl and one of the C58/J proviruses on chromosome 10.","['Taylor, B A', 'Rowe, L']","['Taylor BA', 'Rowe L']","['Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine 04609.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genomics,Genomics,8800135,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Genetic Markers', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/*genetics']",1989/08/01 00:00,1989/08/01 00:01,['1989/08/01 00:00'],"['1989/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genomics. 1989 Aug;5(2):221-32. doi: 10.1016/0888-7543(89)90050-5.,0888-7543 (Print) 0888-7543 (Linking),,"['0888-7543(89)90050-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0888-7543(89)90050-5 [doi]']",['CA 33093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Following incubation with these inhibitors, K562 cells underwent differentiation and accumulated hemoglobins. The induction of hemoglobin accumulation was dose dependent; maximum induction was observed at 100, 25, and 3 microM, respectively, for ribavirin, tiazofurin, and mycophenolic acid. The induction was associated with reduction of intracellular GTP content and was blocked by adding guanosine within 24 h after adding inducer. The effective dose for half-maximum induction by ribavirin was 3 times less than that for 50% inhibition of K562 proliferation; however, for tiazofurin and mycophenolic acid, it closely approximated the concentrations which suppressed cellular proliferation. Ribavirin was sequestered preferentially inside the K562 cells, and the induction by ribavirin had a greater than 30-fold increase in hemoglobin. Studies with isoelectric focusing, globin chain analyses, and immunochemical assays indicated that both A gamma and G gamma were detected and that the hemoglobin produced in the ribavirin-treated cells consisted of approximately 60% fetal hemoglobin and its acetylated equivalents. The adult-type alpha globin was found, while no beta globin chains were demonstrated. Thus, accumulation of fetal hemoglobin and production of alpha globin chain in ribavirin-treated cells are different from the pattern of hemoglobins induced by hemin.","['Yu, J', 'Lemas, V', 'Page, T', 'Connor, J D', 'Yu, A L']","['Yu J', 'Lemas V', 'Page T', 'Connor JD', 'Yu AL']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/10/15 00:00,1989/10/15 00:01,['1989/10/15 00:00'],"['1989/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 15;49(20):5555-60.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA 40186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 37039/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the context of an allogeneic BMT, a number of different immune mechanisms mediated by donor cells may be responsible for the GVL effect. We have approached this question by using limiting dilution cultures of alloactivated human lymphocytes to analyze the in vitro allogeneic cytolytic response against fresh allogeneic leukemia. Initial results in the limiting dilution assays with split culture analyses demonstrated frequent alloreactive cytolytic T lymphocyte precursors that destroyed remission peripheral blood lymphocytes and leukemic cells from the allogeneic leukemic patient. These assays also demonstrated frequent lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell precursors that lysed both the LAK sensitive Daudi line and the allogeneic leukemia. In these experiments, isolated cultures also showed cytolytic activity directed against the allogeneic leukemic blasts without activity against remission PBL, or the LAK-sensitive Daudi cell line. Two T cell lines (ABL1 and ABL2) isolated from an LDA, demonstrated this form of specificity, mediating destruction specifically against the allogeneic acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells. Both cell lines ABL1 and ABL2 were CD3+, TCR alpha beta +, and CD4+. These 2 cell lines mediated little or no cytotoxicity against a large panel of other targets tested (natural killer sensitive and resistant cell lines, allogeneic PBL, and allogeneic fresh leukemic blasts). Antibody-blocking experiments revealed a role for the CD3-TCR receptor of both cell lines in lysis of leukemic cells; the CD4 and MHC class II molecules were clearly involved in the lysis by the ABL1 cell line. Specificity of recognition for the allogeneic leukemic blasts was further confirmed by unlabeled target competitive inhibition studies. The mechanism of the preferential lysis of leukemia by the alloactivated T cell lines described in this paper remains uncertain. Nevertheless, these leukemic-specific populations provide a means by which the human GVL effect may be further studied in vitro.","['Sosman, J A', 'Oettel, K R', 'Hank, J A', 'Fisch, P', 'Sondel, P M']","['Sosman JA', 'Oettel KR', 'Hank JA', 'Fisch P', 'Sondel PM']","['Department of Human Oncology, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53792.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Clone Cells', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-D Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1989 Sep;48(3):486-95. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198909000-00027.,0041-1337 (Print) 0041-1337 (Linking),,['10.1097/00007890-198909000-00027 [doi]'],"['CA-32685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CM-47699/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-003186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,

The distribution of transcribed sequences versus non-transcribed sequences among the fractions was the same, demonstrating that this fractionation procedure, although leading to fractions with biochemical differences, is not able to discriminate functional states of chromatin and that the biochemical characteristics of the fractions may be common to both, active as well as inactive states of chromatin.","['Knosp, O', 'Redl, B', 'Puschendorf, B']","['Knosp O', 'Redl B', 'Puschendorf B']","['Institut fur Medizinische Chemie und Biochemie der Universitat, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.6.1.5 (Tyrosine Transaminase)', 'EC 3.1.31.1 (Micrococcal Nuclease)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/*analysis', 'DNA/analysis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins/genetics', 'Histones/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Micrococcal Nuclease', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tyrosine Transaminase/genetics']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1989 Aug 15;89(1):37-46. doi: 10.1007/BF00228278.,0300-8177 (Print) 0300-8177 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00228278 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

These enzymes, which have a wide distribution on the surfaces of various cell types, may have specific roles in the control of growth and differentiation in both haemopoietic and epithelial cell systems.","['Kenny, A J', ""O'Hare, M J"", 'Gusterson, B A']","['Kenny AJ', ""O'Hare MJ"", 'Gusterson BA']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Leeds.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Breast/enzymology/ultrastructure', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Growth', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Neprilysin/*physiology']",1989/09/30 00:00,1989/09/30 00:01,['1989/09/30 00:00'],"['1989/09/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/30 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1989 Sep 30;2(8666):785-7. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(89)90841-6.,0140-6736 (Print) 0140-6736 (Linking),,"['S0140-6736(89)90841-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(89)90841-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,29,,,

Detection of bcr rearrangement by Southern blot analysis has proven to be a sensitive diagnostic method and can identify this translocation in some cases which appear cytogenetically negative. Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) which involve bcr have the potential to be misinterpreted as gene rearrangements since they result in alteration of the DNA fragment size detected by Southern blot hybridization. We have identified a RFLP involving bcr that is detectable with Eco RI digestion but not with Bam HI, BgI II, or Xba I. The polymorphic fragments generated indicate that this RFLP is the result of an Eco RI restriction site sequence polymorphism.","['Fishleder, A J', 'Shadrach, B', 'Tuttle, C']","['Fishleder AJ', 'Shadrach B', 'Tuttle C']","['Department of Laboratory Hematology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Ohio 44195-5139.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'False Positive Reactions', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Oct;3(10):746-8.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood was cultured with (n = 10) and without (n = 21) the addition of a preformed, irradiated stromal layer. In this latter LTC our results confirm that peripheral blood is capable of producing CFU-GM and nucleated cells in the absence of the formation of an adherent stromal layer. However, peripheral blood cultured in the presence of an irradiated stromal layer is capable of a significantly higher proliferative response (total production of CFU GM per flask - mean = 57529) than in the absence of an irradiated stromal layer (total production of CFU GM per flask - mean = 26739, p less than 0.03). Our results suggest that PBSC contain a primitive nonplastic adherent cell that requires the presence of a stromal layer for its expression.

This cell type reappeared in various characteristic distribution patterns in adult bone marrow during different neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions including metastatic carcinoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma, hairy cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (FAB M4, 5, 7) and chronic myelo-proliferative diseases.

Preliminary observations indicated that the portion of the male homosexual community which developed Kaposi's sarcoma were also heavy nitrite users. These nitrites had been demonstrated to be mutagenic in bacteria and thus it was postulated that they could be responsible for the appearance of the sarcoma. To evaluate further the genotoxic activity of these chemicals, six nitrites, including those most commonly used by homosexuals for sexual gratification, were selected for testing in the mouse lymphoma TK+/- and Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assays. One chemical, n-amyl nitrite, was negative in the mouse lymphoma assay, while the other five chemicals, n-butyl, isobutyl, iso-amyl, sec-butyl, and n-propyl nitrite, were positive. All six compounds were positive in the Salmonella assay. The mutagenic and known toxic effects of these chemicals remain a concern because a large population of teenagers and young adults continue to abuse these substances.","['Dunkel, V C', 'Rogers-Back, A M', 'Lawlor, T E', 'Harbell, J W', 'Cameron, T P']","['Dunkel VC', 'Rogers-Back AM', 'Lawlor TE', 'Harbell JW', 'Cameron TP']","['Food and Drug Administration, Washington, DC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Mol Mutagen,Environmental and molecular mutagenesis,8800109,"['0 (Aphrodisiacs)', '0 (Illicit Drugs)', '0 (Nitrites)', '8017-89-8 (Amyl Nitrite)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Amyl Nitrite/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Aphrodisiacs/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Illicit Drugs/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Nitrites/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Salmonella typhimurium/*drug effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Environ Mol Mutagen. 1989;14(2):115-22. doi: 10.1002/em.2850140207.,0893-6692 (Print) 0893-6692 (Linking),,['10.1002/em.2850140207 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In comparison with the leukemic line CCRF-CEM, using a growth inhibition assay, LALW-2 cells were resistant to Vinca alkaloids and actinomycin D (relative resistance, 200-fold or more), were slightly resistant to Adriamycin (relative resistance, 4-fold), and showed no resistance to daunorubicin or teniposide. By comparison, a vincristine-resistant CEM subline developed in our laboratory (CEM/VCR R) was resistant to all these agents by at least 30-fold. The VCR R subline served as a positive control, confirming the previously reported correlation between multidrug resistance and amplification of the P-glycoprotein gene. Comparison of CEM, CEM/VCR R, and LALW-2 cells establish that the P-glycoprotein gene was not amplified or overexpressed in the LALW-2 cells; neither could the gene product be detected by immunoblotting in extracts from these cells. The LALW-2 cells were further distinguished from CEM/VCR R cells due to the lack of increased vincristine efflux by the xenografted cells, an effect readily demonstrable in the CEM/VCR R cells. However, although LALW-2 cells efflux vincristine at the same rate as CCRF-CEM cells, the xenografted cells exhibited a reduced rate of vincristine accumulation. Uptake of daunorubicin by LALW-2 cells was not distinguished from that by CEM cells, consistent with similar 50% inhibitory dose levels for this drug in both cell populations, and differentiating both from CEM/VCR R cells. Thus, clinical resistance in this case appears to be an ""atypical"" form of multidrug resistance specifically distinguished by resistance to Vinca alkaloids and actinomycin D occurring in the absence of increased amounts of P-glycoprotein and manifesting decreased drug uptake.","['Haber, M', 'Norris, M D', 'Kavallaris, M', 'Bell, D R', 'Davey, R A', 'White, L', 'Stewart, B W']","['Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Kavallaris M', 'Bell DR', 'Davey RA', 'White L', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Unit, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Randwick, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', '*Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Vinca Alkaloids/*metabolism', 'Vincristine/metabolism']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Oct 1;49(19):5281-7.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Tsuruo et al., Cancer Res. 41: 1967-1972, 1981), but the mechanism of action of this agent has not been fully elucidated. A radioactive photoactive analogue of verapamil, N-[benzoyl-3,5-3H-(+/-)-5-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenetyl)methylamino]-2- (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl-N-p-azidobenzoylpentylamine, was used to label the plasma membranes of a human myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562), a multidrug-resistant subline selected for resistance to Adriamycin (K562/ADM) and its revertant cell (R1-3). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoretic fluorograms revealed the presence of an intensely radiolabeled Mr 170,000-180,000 protein in the membranes from K562/ADM but not from the drug-sensitive parental K562 and revertant R1-3 cells. The Mr 170,000-180,000 verapamil acceptor was immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody MRK16 specific for P-glycoprotein associated with multidrug resistance, indicating that P-glycoprotein in the plasma membrane is a major target of verapamil in K562/ADM cells. The photolabeling of P-glycoprotein with N-[benzoyl-3,5-3H]-(+/-)-5-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenetyl)methylamino]-2- (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-isopropyl-N-p-azidobenzoylphentylamine was significantly blocked by other calcium channel blockers, nicardipine and diltiazem, that have been shown to overcome multidrug resistance. In addition, the photolabeling was partially blocked by Adriamycin, vincristine, and colchicine, suggesting that the specific binding sites for verapamil on P-glycoprotein are closely related to the binding sites for these calcium channel blockers and antitumor agents. To determine whether verapamil could be a substrate for P-glycoprotein, the cellular accumulation of [3H]verapamil into K562 and K562/ADM was evaluated. The accumulation of [3H]verapamil in the multidrug-resistant cells was 30% of K562 cells and increased when K562/ADM cells were treated with vincristine and nicardipine at 5 microM, indicating that the P-glycoprotein transports verapamil as well as other antitumor agents in the multidrug-resistant cells. These results suggest that verapamil enhances antitumor agent retention through competition for closely related binding sites on P-glycoprotein.","['Yusa, K', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Yusa K', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '117638-38-7', '((N-benzoyl)-5-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)methylamino)-2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-is', 'opropyl-N-4-azidobenzoylpentylamine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Biological Transport', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Binding', 'Verapamil/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):5002-6.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Formation of nucleotides from [8-3H]CldAdo was investigated in ten lines. In cells exposed to 0.15 microM CldAdo, CldAdo 5'-phosphate (CldAMP) reached 0.7-14 microM and CldAdo 5'-triphosphate (CldATP) reached 0.05-6 microM in 1 h. In most cases these nucleotide concentrations at 1 h were close to the steady-state concentrations, and the latter concentrations were approximately proportional to extracellular CldAdo concentration. On removal of extracellular CldAdo, intracellular CldAMP and CldATP declined rapidly with half times of 0.56-0.9 and 0.64-1.46 h, respectively. There was no correlation between these rates of catabolism and steady-state levels. The different sensitivities of the lines to CldAdo is explained only in part by the different steady-state concentrations of CldATP, and must be more directly related to differential effects on target enzymes. Mice inoculated with L1210 leukemia were treated with 2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine (BrdAdo) paired with one of 18 other therapeutic agents. Eight of the drugs paired with BrdAdo gave therapeutic responses from the combination greater than the sum of the responses of members of the pair. They included alkylating agents, antimetabolites blocking deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and DNA polymerase inhibitors. Toxic dosages of CldAdo caused damage chiefly to the hemic-lymphatic systems and the kidneys.","['Avery, T L', 'Rehg, J E', 'Lumm, W C', 'Harwood, F C', 'Santana, V M', 'Blakley, R L']","['Avery TL', 'Rehg JE', 'Lumm WC', 'Harwood FC', 'Santana VM', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', ""89178-21-2 (2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biotransformation', 'Brain Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cladribine', 'Deoxyadenosines/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects']",1989/09/15 00:00,1989/09/15 00:01,['1989/09/15 00:00'],"['1989/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Sep 15;49(18):4972-8.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA 39242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Nonlabelled preparation of gp30 competitively inhibited the reaction of 125I-labelled gp30 with the natural antibodies. We investigated 193 cattle sera by liquid phase radioimmunoassays (RIA) using 125I-gp30, gp51 and p24 antigens. Sixteen noninfected cattle sera were negative in all tests. The 177 serum samples of BLV-infected animals were examined to the diagnostic value of the three tests. Of these, 175 were positive in gp51 RIA, 172 in p24 RIA and 164 in gp30 RIA.

Of these, GC-II interacts with nuclear factor(s) present in the globin-expressing, erythroleukemia cell line K562, before and after hemin induction. GC-I, however, interacts with nuclear factor(s) only present in hemin-induced K562 cells. These factors are different from previously reported erythroid cell-specific factors, and are not detectable in non-erythroid Hela cells. Furthermore, the sequence of the motif GC-I and its location relative to ATG codon have been conserved among all known mammalian theta 1 globin genes. Finally, and most interestingly, the CCAAT box of theta 1 is contained within a 38 bp internal segment of Alu repeat sequence. Immediately upstream from this CCAAT box-containing Alu repeat segment is a 241 bp Alu repeat pointing in the opposite direction. The conservation of this novel arrangement among the higher primates suggests that an inserted Alu family repeat and its flanking genomic sequence have co-evolved, for at least 30 million years, to provide the canonical CCAAT and TATA promoter elements of the theta 1 globin genes in higher primates.","['Kim, J H', 'Yu, C Y', 'Bailey, A', 'Hardison, R', 'Shen, C K']","['Kim JH', 'Yu CY', 'Bailey A', 'Hardison R', 'Shen CK']","['Department of Genetics, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (Codon)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Codon/genetics', 'Exons', '*Genes', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mosaicism', 'Primates', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1989/07/25 00:00,1989/07/25 00:01,['1989/07/25 00:00'],"['1989/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Jul 25;17(14):5687-700. doi: 10.1093/nar/17.14.5687.,0305-1048 (Print) 0305-1048 (Linking),,['10.1093/nar/17.14.5687 [doi]'],"['DK 27635/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 29800/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC318189,,,,,,,,

We used probes from within the breakpoint region on 7q-chromosomes (7q22-34) that detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) to investigate three families in which two siblings developed myelodysplasia with monosomy 7. In the first family, probes from the proximal part of this region identified DNA derived from the same maternal chromosome in both leukemias. The RFLPs in these siblings diverged at the more distal J3.11 marker due to a mitotic recombination in one patient, a result that suggested a critical region on 7q proximal to probe J3.11. Detailed RFLP mapping of the implicated region was then performed in two additional unrelated pairs of affected siblings. In these families, DNA derived from different parental chromosome 7s was retained in the leukemic bone marrows of the siblings. We conclude that the familial predisposition to myelodysplasia is not located within a consistently deleted segment on the long arm of chromosome 7.

The incident energies of the ion beams were in the range of 460 +/- 95 MeV u-1, and the calculated values of linear energy transfer (LET infinity) for the primary nuclei in the irradiated samples were 33 +/- 3, 60 +/- 3, 95 +/- 5, 213 +/- 21 and 478 +/- 36 keV microns-1, respectively; 280 kVp X-rays were used as the baseline radiation. Generally, the maxima or inflections in relations between relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and LET infinity were dependent upon the cycle position at which the cells were irradiated. Certain of those relations were influenced by post-irradiation hypothermia. Irradiation in the cell cycle at mid-G1 to mid-G1 + 3 h, henceforth called G1 to G1 + 3 h, resulted in survival curves that were close approximations to simple exponential functions. As the LET infinity was increased, the RBE did not exceed 1.0, and by 478 keV microns-1 it had fallen to 0.39. Although similar behaviour has been reported for inactivation of proteins and certain viruses by ionizing radiations, so far the response of the S/S variant is unique for mammalian cells. The slope of the survival curve for X-photons (D0: 0.27 Gy) is reduced in G1 to G1 + 3 h by post-irradiation incubation at hypothermic temperatures and reaches a minimum (Do: 0.51 Gy) at 25 degrees C. As the LET infinity was increased, however, the extent of hypothermic recovery was reduced progressively and essentially was eliminated at 478 keV microns-1. At the cycle position where the peak of radioresistance to X-photons occurs for S/S cells, G1 + 8 h, increases in LET infinity elicited only small increases in RBE (at 10% survival), until a maximum was reached around 200 keV microns-1. At 478 keV microns-1, what little remained of the variation in response through the cell cycle could be attributed to secondary radiations (delta rays) and smaller nuclei produced by fragmentation of the primary ions.","['Lett, J T', 'Cox, A B', 'Story, M D', 'Ehmann, U K', 'Blakely, E A']","['Lett JT', 'Cox AB', 'Story MD', 'Ehmann UK', 'Blakely EA']","['Department of Radiology and Radiation Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

The v-erb-A oncogene blocks the differentiation of erythroid cells, and changes the growth requirements of fibroblasts and erythroblasts. Mutations in v-erb-A protein have led to the loss of its affinity for thyroid hormones but do not affect its DNA-binding ability, a property required for biological activity. We report here the identification of a novel thyroid-hormone response element (TRE) in the long terminal repeat of Moloney murine leukaemia virus that binds the c-erb-A-alpha protein. The v-erb-A protein abolishes the responsiveness of this TRE to thyroid hormone, although it has a lower affinity than the normal receptor for the TRE. The data indicate that overexpressed v-erb-A protein negatively interferes with normal transcriptional-control mechanisms, and that amino-acid substitutions have altered its DNA-binding properties.","['Sap, J', 'Munoz, A', 'Schmitt, J', 'Stunnenberg, H', 'Vennstrom, B']","['Sap J', 'Munoz A', 'Schmitt J', 'Stunnenberg H', 'Vennstrom B']","['European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbA)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Thyroid Hormones)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbA', '*Oncogenes', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/physiology', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics/pharmacology', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thyroid Hormones/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Triiodothyronine/pharmacology']",1989/07/20 00:00,1989/07/20 00:01,['1989/07/20 00:00'],"['1989/07/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nature. 1989 Jul 20;340(6230):242-4. doi: 10.1038/340242a0.,0028-0836 (Print) 0028-0836 (Linking),,['10.1038/340242a0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

These observations provide the first clue that the Ca-binding protein, sorcin, may play an important role in the development of the multidrug resistance phenomenon, although the relationship between sorcin and P-glycoprotein is still unknown.","['Sugawara, I', 'Mizumoto, K', 'Ohkochi, E', 'Hamada, H', 'Tsuruo, T', 'Mori, S']","['Sugawara I', 'Mizumoto K', 'Ohkochi E', 'Hamada H', 'Tsuruo T', 'Mori S']","['Department of Pathology, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SRI protein, human)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 May;80(5):469-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02338.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb02338.x [doi]'],,PMC5917763,,,,,,,,

We concluded that the lymphocytes positive for the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen present in normal peripheral blood (PB) are natural killer (NK) cells since the positive cells had an NK activity toward K562 cells, and most of the sialyl SSEA-1+ cells were simultaneously positive for Leu-11 (CD-16) and Leu-19. Essentially, no T and B cells, defined by Leu-4 (CD3) and Leu-16 (CD20), were positive for the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen in PB samples taken from healthy donors and patients with disorders unrelated to lymphoid malignancies. Among the malignant lymphoid cells, many sialylated SSEA-1+ cells were observed in large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia cells and some acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) blasts, but not in CLL cells or malignant lymphoma cells. Sialyl SSEA-1 was also positive in some cultured human lymphoid cell lines. We conclude that expression of the sialyl SSEA-1 antigen is strictly limited to a distinct population of NK cells among the mature lymphocytes in normal PB, but the antigen is present in a wide range of immature lymphoblasts of T- and B-cell lineages as well as the NK-cell lineage. The sialyl SSEA-1 antigen disappears from the surface of immature lymphocytes of T- and B-cell lineages during the course of maturation.","['Ohmori, K', 'Yoneda, T', 'Ishihara, G', 'Shigeta, K', 'Hirashima, K', 'Kanai, M', 'Itai, S', 'Sasaoki, T', 'Arii, S', 'Arita, H']","['Ohmori K', 'Yoneda T', 'Ishihara G', 'Shigeta K', 'Hirashima K', 'Kanai M', 'Itai S', 'Sasaoki T', 'Arii S', 'Arita H', 'et al.']","['Department of Clinical Science and Laboratory Medicine, Kyoto University, School of Medicine, Sakyoku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Sialic Acids)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glycolipids/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Lymphocytes/classification/cytology/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sialic Acids', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Jul;74(1):255-61.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)77349-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

The primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose of taxol administered on this schedule to patients with acute leukemias and describe the nonhematological toxicities which became dose limiting. The starting dose, 200 mg/m2, was based on the maximum tolerated dose in solid tumor trials, in which myelosuppression precluded dose escalation. Seventeen patients received 28 evaluable courses at 200, 250, 315, and 390 mg/m2. Severe mucositis limited further dose escalation. Other nonhematological effects included peripheral neuropathy, alopecia, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and an acute pulmonary reaction that was presumptively due to taxol's Cremophor vehicle. Mean peak taxol plasma concentrations at all dose levels were in the range of concentrations that were previously demonstrated to induce microtubule bundles, a morphological effect associated with cytotoxicity, in leukemia cells in vitro. Pretreatment blasts from 12 patients were incubated with taxol ex vivo. Taxol-induced microtubule bundles were apparent in the blasts of eight patients who also had cytoreduction of tumor, and sensitivity to bundle formation was related to the magnitude of antitumor activity. In contrast, taxol did not induce microtubule bundles ex vivo in the blasts of the other four total nonresponders. Based on this study, the maximum tolerated doses and recommended Phase II doses for taxol, limited by nonhematological toxicity and administered as a 24-h i.v. infusion to patients with refractory leukemias, are 390 and 315 mg/m2. Phase II trials at these myelosuppressive doses are required to determine taxol's activity in the treatment of leukemias. In addition, further evaluation of microtubule bundle formation ex vivo in Phase II studies is necessary to determine the ultimate utility of this assay in assessing tumor sensitivity to taxol.","['Rowinsky, E K', 'Burke, P J', 'Karp, J E', 'Tucker, R W', 'Ettinger, D S', 'Donehower, R C']","['Rowinsky EK', 'Burke PJ', 'Karp JE', 'Tucker RW', 'Ettinger DS', 'Donehower RC']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaloids/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth Mucosa/drug effects', 'Paclitaxel', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced', 'Stomatitis/chemically induced']",1989/08/15 00:00,1989/08/15 00:01,['1989/08/15 00:00'],"['1989/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Aug 15;49(16):4640-7.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,['CM 57738/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The MX2 cells are cross-resistant to etoposide, teniposide, bisantrene, dactinomycin, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide, and the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin but retain sensitivity to the Vinca alkaloids melphalan and mitomycin C. In addition, the MX2 cells display slight collateral sensitivity to bleomycin. Despite being 30-35-fold less sensitive to mitoxantrone, net [14C]mitoxantrone accumulation at 60 min was reduced by only 10% in the mitoxantrone-resistant cells compared to the parental line. Furthermore, at later time points, e.g., 120 and 180 min, mitoxantrone accumulation in the MX2 cells exceeded that in HL-60 cells by 8.5 and 6.4%, respectively. No significant differences were observed between the sensitive and resistant cell lines in the initial (first 60 s) accumulation of mitoxantrone, and only minor (3-6%) enhancement of mitoxantrone efflux was detected in the resistant cell type. Monoclonal antibodies to P-glycoprotein had no detectable reactivity with membrane vesicles from either the sensitive or resistant cell types as determined by standard immunoblotting techniques. The mitoxantrone-resistant cells displayed a reciprocal translocation [rcpt(1;3)-(q21;p23)] not found in the sensitive parent, but there were no demonstrable double minute chromosomes or homogeneous staining regions in cells from either line.

In HL60 cells stained with the MBCl probe, a bright diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence pattern was observed, whereas in HL60/AR cells, the fluorescence was mostly localized to the Golgi apparatus with a lesser component of diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear fluorescence. Pretreatment of HL60/AR cells with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) partially reversed resistance to daunorubicin. This effect of BSO on resistance was associated not only with the abolition of localized MBCl fluorescence to the Golgi apparatus but also with increased intracellular accumulation and retention of daunorubicin.

In addition to enhancing drug cytotoxicity in our multidrug-resistant human leukemia cell line, CEM/VLB100, reserpine strongly competes with a photoactivatible analog of vinblastine, N-(p-azido-3-[125I]iodosalicyl)-N'-(beta-aminoethyl)vindesine, for binding to P-glycoprotein. We also demonstrated previously that there are three substructural domains present in many compounds that modulate P-glycoprotein-associated MDR: a basic nitrogen atom and two planar aromatic rings. In the present study, we wished to test more rigorously the hypothesis that not only are these domains necessary for modulators of MDR but also they must exist in an appropriate conformation. Reserpine is a modulator of MDR in which these domains are present in a well-defined conformation. Accordingly, we prepared eight compounds that vary the spatial orientation of these domains, using either naturally occurring reserpine or yohimbine as chemical templates. When tested for their ability to enhance the cytotoxic activity of natural product antitumor drugs in CEM/VLB100 cells, five compounds that retained the pendant benzoyl function in an appropriate spatial orientation all modulated MDR. By contrast, compounds lacking this moiety failed to do so. These active modulators competed strongly with the 125I-labeled vinblastine analog for binding to P-glycoprotein in plasma membrane vesicles prepared from these cells. Conformational analysis using molecular mechanics revealed the structural similarities of the active modulators. Our results support the hypothesis that the relative disposition of aromatic rings and basic nitrogen atom is important for modulators of P-glycoprotein-associated MDR, and they suggest a ligand-receptor relationship for these agents. These results also provide direction for the definition of an MDR ""pharmacophore.""","['Pearce, H L', 'Safa, A R', 'Bach, N J', 'Winter, M A', 'Cirtain, M C', 'Beck, W T']","['Pearce HL', 'Safa AR', 'Bach NJ', 'Winter MA', 'Cirtain MC', 'Beck WT']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN 46285.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '2Y49VWD90Q (Yohimbine)', '8B1QWR724A (Reserpine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Reserpine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects', 'Yohimbine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jul;86(13):5128-32. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.13.5128.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.86.13.5128 [doi]'],"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC297570,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report on the linkage between a new DNA marker, designated p alpha 1.4P, and the DM locus in 50 families. The probe p alpha 1.4P was derived from a cloned breakpoint junction fragment from the chromosomal translocation t(14;19)(q32;q13.1). This translocation has been previously described in some cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have identified a BanI restriction fragment length polymorphism that is detected by p alpha 1.4P. Segregation analysis between this RFLP and DM revealed close linkage between the two loci (lod = 10.95, theta = 0). Furthermore, statistical evidence for linkage disequilibrium between p alpha 1.4P and the DM locus in a French Canadian population was found.

Here we demonstrate that the triggering of subclones of the human T leukemia Jurkat cell line by anti-CD2 as well as anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies is able to induce activation (i.e. translocation from cytosol to cell membrane) of protein kinase C (PKC), which is dependent on the formation of 1,2-diacylglycerol from inositol 4-5-bisphosphate. The kinetics of PKC translocation parallels the rise in intracellular calcium following both CD2 and CD3 stimulations.

The multidrug-resistant phenotype was obtained in different conditions of selection (in vivo and in vitro for P388/DX and B16VDXR, respectively). In both multidrug-resistant cell lines, an increased expression of P-glycoprotein gene (5 kb transcript detected in Northern blots) was observed and the level of P-glycoprotein mRNA correlated with the degree of resistance. In addition, high molecular weight mRNAs homologous to mdrl gene sequence were consistently detected only in P388/DX cells. Overexpression was associated with a high level of gene amplification only in resistant melanoma cells, whereas it occurred in P388/DX cells with a marginal increase in gene copy number.

In those cases terminating in overt leukemia (6/31, 19%), the number of bone marrow mast cells was significantly reduced, compared with those which did not evolve to overt leukemia. The bone marrow lymphoid cells that may participate in immunosurveillance against the proliferation of blast cells were also significantly reduced in cases terminating in overt leukemia. However, S-100 protein-positive cells, which include histiocytes and suppressor T-cells, were increased in cases terminating in overt leukemia. The results indicated that examination of the bone marrow to determine the proportions of mast cells and lymphoid cells which may be involved in host defense systems may be useful in predicting the evolution to overt leukemia in MDS. In the present series, patients with a hypocellular marrow (5/31, 16%) did not progress to overt leukemia and had a significantly lower bone marrow reticulin content, a significantly lower megakaryocyte count, a relatively higher mast cell count and a significantly higher lymphoid cell count than those with a normocellular or hypercellular marrow.

Sixteen consecutive patients with end stage acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia were treated with tiazofurin. Allopurinol was also given to inhibit xanthine oxidase activity to decrease uric acid excretion and to elevate the serum concentration of hypoxanthine, which should competitively inhibit the activity of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.8), the salvage enzyme of guanylate synthesis. Assays of IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP concentration in leukemic cells provided a method to monitor the impact of tiazofurin and allopurinol and to adjust the drug doses. In this group of patients with poor prognosis, five attained a complete hematological remission and one showed a hematological improvement. A marked antileukemic effect was seen in two other patients. All five evaluable patients with myeloid blast crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia reentered the chronic phase of their disease. Five patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia were refractory to tiazofurin and three were unevaluable for hematological effect because of early severe complications. Responses with intermittent 5- to 15-day courses of tiazofurin lasted 3-10 months. Tiazofurin had a clear antiproliferative effect, but the pattern of hematological response indicated that it appeared to induce differentiation of leukemic cells. In spite of toxicity with severe or life-threatening complications in 11 of 16 patients, tiazofurin was better tolerated in most patients than other antileukemic treatment modalities and provided a rational, biochemically targeted, and biochemically monitored chemotherapy which should be of interest in the treatment of leukemias and as a paradigm in enzyme pattern-targeted chemotherapy.","['Tricot, G J', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Lapis, E', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Nichols, C R', 'Kneebone, P', 'Heerema, N', 'Weber, G', 'Hoffman, R']","['Tricot GJ', 'Jayaram HN', 'Lapis E', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Nichols CR', 'Kneebone P', 'Heerema N', 'Weber G', 'Hoffman R']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.2.- (Ketone Oxidoreductases)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Blast Crisis', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ketone Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Ribavirin/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Ribonucleosides/*therapeutic use']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jul 1;49(13):3696-701.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO7 RR-5371/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

A variety of compounds can reproducibly induce these cells to differentiate towards specific lineages. However, under what appear to be similar experimental conditions, various laboratories have reported either neutrophilic differentiation or monocytic differentiation after butyric acid induction. We investigated different hypotheses to explain these dissimilar findings. First, the potential role of variable 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) concentrations in commercial fetal calf serum was assessed. Second, possible differences between laboratories inherent to the HL-60 cells themselves were explored. Lineage was assessed by morphology, histochemistry (nonspecific esterase), and neutrophil-specific (CD15) and monocyte-specific (MO2) surface antigens. We found that increasing concentrations of VD3 spanning the range reported in commercial fetal calf serum (25 to 155 pg/ml) act in synergy with butyric acid to result in higher monocyte/neutrophil ratios at the higher VD3 concentrations. Different lots of serum led to monocyte/neutrophil ratios in proportion to their VD3 concentrations. Starting with HL-60 cells obtained from different laboratories, several single-cell clones were derived which yielded either high percentages of monocytes, high percentages of neutrophils, or intermediate mixes of both cell types after induction with butyric acid. We conclude that the wide variation of VD3 concentration found in different lots of commercial fetal calf serum and intrinsic differences in HL-60 cells are two identifiable factors that can explain the discrepancies in lineage observed by different investigators after butyric acid induction of HL-60 cells.","['Hoessly, M C', 'Rossi, R M', 'Fischkoff, S A']","['Hoessly MC', 'Rossi RM', 'Fischkoff SA']","['Hematology/Oncology Section, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104-4283.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Separation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Neutrophils/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jul 1;49(13):3594-7.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

This implies that the molecular structures of the two chromosomal translocations also differ. Localization of translocation breakpoints in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL has been impeded due to the only partial characterization of the BCR locus. We have isolated the entire 130-kilobase BCR genomic locus from a human cosmid library. A series of five single-copy genomic probes from the 70-kilobase first intron of BCR were used to localize rearrangements in 8 of 10 Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALLs. We have demonstrated that these breakpoints are all located at the 3' end of the intron around an unusual restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by deletion of a 1-kilobase fragment containing Alu family reiterated sequences. This clustering is unexpected in light of previous theories of rearrangement in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia that would have predicted a random dispersion of breakpoints in the first intron in Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL.

All patients were being treated for various forms of leukemia or lymphoma. In 10 patients, granulocytes isolated from peripheral-blood samples obtained 28 to 159 days after transplantation were polyclonal. In some, circulating T cells were isolated and also found to be polyclonal. In contrast, two patients had donor-derived monoclonal or oligoclonal hematopoiesis after transplantation. In one, DNA from circulating mononuclear cells obtained 29 days after transplantation revealed a monoclonal pattern on analysis of a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism in the phosphoglycerate kinase gene. In the other, analysis of a restriction-fragment-length polymorphism in the hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene suggested the presence of a dominant clone in the granulocytes sampled 36 days after transplantation. When the latter patient was reassessed on day 267, the same clone of donor hematopoietic cells was still predominant and was found to include circulating T cells as well as granulocytes. We conclude that monoclonal hematopoiesis of donor origin may be observed in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants, indicating that stem cells in normal adult human marrow are able to repopulate both lymphoid and myeloid compartments after transplantation.","['Turhan, A G', 'Humphries, R K', 'Phillips, G L', 'Eaves, A C', 'Eaves, C J']","['Turhan AG', 'Humphries RK', 'Phillips GL', 'Eaves AC', 'Eaves CJ']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Research Centre, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/*analysis', 'Female', 'Genetic Linkage', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'X Chromosome']",1989/06/22 00:00,1989/06/22 00:01,['1989/06/22 00:00'],"['1989/06/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/22 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/22 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1989 Jun 22;320(25):1655-61. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198906223202504.,0028-4793 (Print) 0028-4793 (Linking),,['10.1056/NEJM198906223202504 [doi]'],,,,['N Engl J Med. 1989 Dec 21;321(25):1758-9.

Correlation of its serum level with the classification of HIV-induced diseases and its characterization.,4248-55,"By using a fluorescence sandwich ELISA, elevated IL-2R levels were detected in the sera from both HIV-infected hemophiliacs and other HIV-infected patients. The serum IL-2R levels were reflective of the classification of HIV-induced diseases by the Centers for Disease Control. Moreover, the IL-2R levels were negatively correlated most prominently with CD4 cell counts, with lymphocyte counts, and with a decrease in the CD4-CD8 ratio but not with either WBC counts or B cell counts. As striking elevations of serum IL-2R were noted in AIDS patients with group IVD infection, the serum IL-2R was purified sequentially by using size-exclusion HPLC, high-pressure chromatofocusing, and H48 affinity HPLC. The isoelectric point values of IL-2R were separated into 4.2 and 3.8, whereas the Mr was determined to be only 45 kDa by immunoprecipitation with H48 antibody followed by SDS-PAGE. However, production of cellular and supernatant IL-2R was not elevated in PBMC of patients with AIDS or in any of the 19 HIV-I- or HIV-II-infected cell line cells. In contrast, PBMC from patients with adult T cell leukemia and cell line cells that expressed human T cell lymphotropic virus -I or -II produced soluble IL-2R, constitutively. The mechanisms by which serum levels of IL-2R might be elevated in HIV-infected patients are discussed in comparison with that in adult T cell leukemia patients.","['Honda, M', 'Kitamura, K', 'Matsuda, K', 'Yokota, Y', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Mitsuyasu, R', 'Chermann, J C', 'Tokunaga, T']","['Honda M', 'Kitamura K', 'Matsuda K', 'Yokota Y', 'Yamamoto N', 'Mitsuyasu R', 'Chermann JC', 'Tokunaga T']","['Department of Cellular Immunology, National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/blood/*classification/etiology', 'Cell Line', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/blood/*classification/etiology', 'Hemophilia A/blood/complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*analysis/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Solubility']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Jun 15;142(12):4248-55.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Five of 463 cases of childhood ALL with adequately banded leukemic cells were found to have two cytogenetically independent cell populations. In addition, two of the four cases tested had more than two rearranged immunoglobulin genes and (or) T cell receptor genes. To investigate the clonality of these unusual leukemias, we examined the neoplastic cells for X-linked markers extrinsic to the disease. Leukemic cells from each of the three patients heterozygous for an X-linked, restriction fragment length polymorphism showed a single active parental allele, suggesting that both apparently independent cell populations developed from a common progenitor.

The mechanism of action of the drug was investigated using MT-4 cells. Cytotoxic action was diminished by the removal of n-pentyl DvFc from the culture or by the addition of sulfhydryl compounds such as 2-mercaptoethanol and dithiothreitol. The killing activity of n-pentyl DvFc was also diminished by membrane-acting agents including quinidine and diphenylhydantoin. Influx and subsequent efflux of Ca2+ were observed when either HTLV-I infected (MT-4 cells) or uninfected cells were treated with n-pentyl DvFc. An efflux of K+ was observed in HTLV-I infected MT-4 cells immediately after the exposure of the cells to n-pentyl DvFc. The K+ efflux, however, was not observed in the uninfected T cells. n-Pentyl DvFc seems to act primarily on the cell surface of MT-4 cells, leading to the perturbation of membrane function. The restoration of cell growth, however, is critically dependent on the presence of dithiothreitol and 2-mercaptoethanol, implying a role for a free sulfhydryl group in the killing activity.","['Ito, S', 'Yamamoto, N', 'Nomoto, K', 'Sasaki, K', 'Onodera, K']","['Ito S', 'Yamamoto N', 'Nomoto K', 'Sasaki K', 'Onodera K']","['Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Antibiot (Tokyo),The Journal of antibiotics,0151115,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '1404-74-6 (Streptovaricin)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', '6158TKW0C5 (Phenytoin)', '70940-04-4 (damavaricin Fc pentyl ether)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'RWP5GA015D (Potassium)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dithiothreitol/pharmacology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Phenytoin/pharmacology', 'Potassium/metabolism', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Streptovaricin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/microbiology']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Antibiot (Tokyo). 1989 May;42(5):779-87. doi: 10.7164/antibiotics.42.779.,0021-8820 (Print) 0021-8820 (Linking),,['10.7164/antibiotics.42.779 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate the study of human P-glycoprotein, monoclonal antibodies (designated HYB-612, HYB-241, and HYB-195) were raised against vincristine-resistant human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y/VCR) cells. The antibodies recognize a Mr 180,000 plasma membrane phosphoglycoprotein produced in increased amounts in SH-SY5Y/VCR as well as in vincristine-resistant human neuroepithelioma (MC-IXC/VCR), vinblastine-resistant human leukemia (CEM/VLB100), and actinomycin D- or vincristine-resistant Chinese hamster (DC-3F/AD X and DC-3F/VCRd-5L) cells, as compared to control cells. Radioimmunoprecipitation of proteins in cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine, 32Pi, or [3H]glucosamine and Western transfer procedures were used for these studies. Characterization of the HYB-612 or HYB-241 antigen by destructive degradation produced a pattern of results typical of a conformation-dependent protein epitope. HYB-612 recognizes complexes of the Mr 180,000 antigen with an iodinated photoaffinity analogue of vinblastine or with tritiated azidopine. Furthermore, pretreatment of MC-IXC and MC-IXC/VCR cells with HYB-612 or HYB-241 before measurement of tritium-labeled actinomycin D or vincristine uptake increases the amount of drug accumulation in resistant, but not in sensitive, cells. Of importance is the fact that the Mr 180,000 protein is expressed in cells which also contain a Mr 170,000 P-glycoprotein. The relative amounts of the Mr 180,000 and 170,000 species vary from one drug-resistant cell line to another. Evidence that the Mr 180,000 protein is a P-glycoprotein and that there is a conserved complex pattern of resistance-related surface proteins in multidrug-resistant cells is presented in this report.","['Meyers, M B', 'Rittmann-Grauer, L', ""O'Brien, J P"", 'Safa, A R']","['Meyers MB', 'Rittmann-Grauer L', ""O'Brien JP"", 'Safa AR']","['Laboratory of Cellular and Biochemical Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/analysis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry', 'Dactinomycin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Vincristine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1989/06/15 00:00,1989/06/15 00:01,['1989/06/15 00:00'],"['1989/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Jun 15;49(12):3209-14.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA-28595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-47652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry.,1119-22,"It is not known whether chemotherapy or bone-marrow transplantation is the more effective treatment for acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in first remission. Consequently, some centres recommend transplants only for patients for whom a poor response to chemotherapy is predicted. To assess how reasonable this strategy is, data from 704 recipients of HLA-identical sibling transplants for AML in first remission were analysed. 5-year leukaemia-free survival (LFS) was 48% (95% confidence interval 43-53%); leukaemia relapse rate was 20% (16-24%). Improved LFS was associated with younger age and lower white blood cell count at diagnosis. These prognostic variables are similar to those reported to affect outcome after chemotherapy.

Here we show that efflux of two specific poly(A)-rich mRNAs (actin and beta-tubulin) from isolated L-cell nuclei is almost totally dependent on the presence of ATP, while efflux of poly(A)-free histone mRNA (H4, H2B, and H1) also occurs to a marked extent in the absence of this nucleotide. Measurements of temperature dependence of transport rate revealed an activation energy of 56.1 kJ/mol for actin mRNA, while the activation energy for histone-H4-mRNA efflux was in the same range as that found for ATP-induced release of RNA from demembranated nuclei (about 15-20 kJ/mol). Addition of nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analogs of ATP to the in vitro system used for measurement of RNA transport did not result in release of nonhistone mRNA (actin), but enhanced the efflux of H4 mRNA to approximately the same extent as ATP. Although not absolutely required, addition of ATP stimulated the rate of export of histone mRNA about twofold. Only the poly(A)-rich RNA, but not the poly(A)-free RNA, released from isolated nuclei was found to compete with poly(A) for the nuclear envelope mRNA-binding site, indicating the mechanism of transport for both RNA classes to be distinct. Export of both nonhistone and histone mRNA was found to be inhibited by a monoclonal antibody against a p60 nuclear-pore-complex antigen. This antibody had no effect on the nucleoside triphosphatase, mediating transport of poly(A)-rich mRNA.","['Schroder, H C', 'Friese, U', 'Bachmann, M', 'Zaubitzer, T', 'Muller, W E']","['Schroder HC', 'Friese U', 'Bachmann M', 'Zaubitzer T', 'Muller WE']","['Institut fur Physiologische Chemie der Universitat, Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '24937-83-5 (Poly A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Envelope/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Poly A/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1989/04/15 00:00,1989/04/15 00:01,['1989/04/15 00:00'],"['1989/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Apr 15;181(1):149-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14706.x.,0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb14706.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Donor cell relapse is generally identified using cytogenetic markers such as the sex chromosomes. Recently, molecular techniques have been used to identify the origin of bone marrow cells by their DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms. We describe the case of a male pediatric patient who had a leukemic relapse 30 months following BMT from his sister. Both cytogenetic and molecular techniques were used to identify the origin of the leukemic relapse. Cytogenetic analyses indicated the absence of the Y chromosome and the presence of a donor cell type 9qh polymorphism, suggesting a donor cell relapse. Molecular analyses also indicated the absence of the Y chromosome but demonstrated the recurrence of recipient DNA markers from three other chromosomes, suggesting a recipient cell relapse. While the leukemic cell lineage cannot be definitively assigned in this case, our results suggest that caution must be exercised when assigning leukemic cell lineage following post-BMT relapse.","['Stein, J', 'Zimmerman, P A', 'Kochera, M', 'Strandjord, S', 'Golden, W', 'Simon, M', 'Warkentin, P', 'Blazar, B R', 'Coccia, P', 'Lang-Unnasch, N']","['Stein J', 'Zimmerman PA', 'Kochera M', 'Strandjord S', 'Golden W', 'Simon M', 'Warkentin P', 'Blazar BR', 'Coccia P', 'Lang-Unnasch N']","['Department of Pediatrics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (DNA Probes)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow/analysis/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Probes', 'Humans', '*Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Postoperative Complications/blood/etiology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/pathology/surgery', 'Recurrence', 'Tissue Donors']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 May 15;73(7):2033-40.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)75524-2 [pii]'],['K08 AM 1509/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Human monocyte-derived macrophages and human alveolar macrophages express elevated levels of the CD11c subunit antigen and mRNA, indicating that the changes observed in vitro are present in vivo.

These results indicate that there is a basal rate of transcription, splicing, and polyadenylation of tissue-specific mRNAs in adult and embryonic tissues. In addition to revealing sequence information, it is possible to generate a desired in vitro translation product by incorporating a translation initiation signal into the appropriate PCR primer. RAWTS can be used to obtain novel mRNA sequence information from other species as illustrated with a segment of the catalytic domain of factor IX.

Rwandan HIV Seroprevalence Study Group.,941-3,"In December, 1986, a nationwide serological survey of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in the general population of Rwanda was done in two parts--one in the rural and the other in the urban population. The sampling method was a modification of the cluster sampling technique developed for monitoring immunisation coverage. Antibodies to HIV-1 (and to HIV-2 and human T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma virus type I [HTLV-I]) were detected by immunoenzymatic assays and confirmed by western blot. The number of clusters surveyed was 30 in each setting, urban and rural. HIV-1 seroprevalence was 17.8% (95% confidence interval 14.3-21.2%) in the urban sample (n = 1870) and 1.3% (0.5-2.2%) in the rural sample (n = 742). In the urban sample, females were more frequently HIV-1 seropositive than males (21.0% vs 14.6%). Age-specific peaks of HIV-1 seroprevalence were identified at 0 to 5 years of age (10.1%) and at 26-40 years (30.0%). No differences in seroprevalence were observed in terms of age and sex in the rural sample. None of the sera were seropositive for HIV-2 and HTLV-I seroprevalence was 0.2% in the urban sample and 0.3% in the rural.

These lymphomas all express detectable levels of MMTV RNA, yet the majority of the tumors fail to produce MMTV particles. To determine if the ability of lymphomas to produce MMTV is a reflection of the differentiation state of the tumor, we examined eight lymphomas for expression of surface B and T cell Ag as well as for rearrangements and expression of TCR genes. All tumors could be grouped into three categories observed in vivo, including early lymphoid, nonmature intrathymic T cells, and immature intrathymic T cells. Cell lines corresponding to all three phenotypes produced MMTV particles, suggesting that production of virus is not linked to the differentiation state of lymphoid cells. These studies highlight the potential advantage of studying T cell lymphomas vs mixed primary populations or T cell hybridomas for evaluation of both phenotypic and molecular markers in clonal T cells.","['Meyers, S', 'Gottlieb, P D', 'Dudley, J P']","['Meyers S', 'Gottlieb PD', 'Dudley JP']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas, Austin 78712.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Ly', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Leukemia L1210/classification/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*classification/immunology/microbiology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'Proviruses/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/*classification/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*classification/physiology', 'Thy-1 Antigens', 'Thymus Gland']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 May 1;142(9):3342-50.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,"['AI 23745/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30147/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the molecular events that underscore their action involve alterations in gene expression, but no gene has yet been shown to be directly regulated by these molecules. Several years ago, we found that retinoic acid caused an accumulation of the enzyme tissue transglutaminase in murine peritoneal macrophages and in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. We now report that this induction is caused by an increase in the mRNA for this enzyme. Retinoic acid is the only mediator of this induction, since its effects do not depend on the presence of serum proteins. The induction of tissue transglutaminase mRNA is not due to an increase in its stability but to an increase in the relative transcription rate of its gene. We present a model to correlate the retinoid induction of tissue transglutaminase with retinoid effects on cellular growth and differentiation.","['Chiocca, E A', 'Davies, P J', 'Stein, J P']","['Chiocca EA', 'Davies PJ', 'Stein JP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical School, Houston 77225.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retinoids)', '0 (Retinol-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.13 (Transglutaminases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Densitometry', 'Enzyme Induction', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Retinoids/*pharmacology', 'Retinol-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transglutaminases/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1989 Mar;39(3):293-304. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240390309.,0730-2312 (Print) 0730-2312 (Linking),,['10.1002/jcb.240390309 [doi]'],"['CA 41829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 27078/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Although this compound was 10-fold less toxic to normal cells than daunomycin, multidrug-resistant cells were cross-resistant to it. Like other drugs to which these cells are cross-resistant, its accumulation by them was greatly reduced, compared with drug-sensitive cells. We have also utilized this compound in photoaffinity labeling experiments to identify its target in multidrug-resistant cells.

Although mitotic arrest was most prominent in the esophagus, it was also found in the stomach, small intestine, colon, liver, and bone marrow. The mitotic arrest was associated with bundling of intermediate filaments and appeared to be secondary to accumulation of polymerized microtubules. These results suggest that taxol induces a transient mitotic arrest associated with cell necrosis.","['Hruban, R H', 'Yardley, J H', 'Donehower, R C', 'Boitnott, J K']","['Hruban RH', 'Yardley JH', 'Donehower RC', 'Boitnott JK']","['Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaloids/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*adverse effects', 'Digestive System/*drug effects/pathology', 'Epithelium/pathology', 'Female', 'Germ Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis/*drug effects', 'Necrosis', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Paclitaxel', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Testis/drug effects']",1989/05/15 00:00,1989/05/15 00:01,['1989/05/15 00:00'],"['1989/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1989 May 15;63(10):1944-50. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<1944::aid-cncr2820631013>3.0.co;2-#.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(19890515)63:10<1944::aid-cncr2820631013>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells there is a distinct down regulation of the c-myc proto-oncogene expression, which is probably a causal mechanism. With differentiation of HL-60 cells we found no restriction enzyme fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) within the c-myc proto-oncogene, which indicates that there is no loss of regulatory elements (e.g., TATAA boxes within the first exon). Furthermore, we found no de novo methylation in this region. Methylation of other DNA regions, which could influence c-myc expression, is also not necessary for differentiation, as was shown by inhibition of DNA methylase. L-Ethionine and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine are both potent inhibitors of DNA methylase and do not influence proliferation of HL-60 cells, as shown by FACS analysis.","['Gieseler, F', 'Meyer, P', 'Schiffmann, D', 'Wilms, K']","['Gieseler F', 'Meyer P', 'Schiffmann D', 'Wilms K']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, Universitat Wurzburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Modification Methylases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1989 Mar;58(3):159-63. doi: 10.1007/BF00320438.,0006-5242 (Print) 0006-5242 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00320438 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

A survey of 31 leukemia cell lines of the myeloid, lymphoid and erythroid lineages revealed that Hox-2.4 was expressed only in WEHI3B and the pre-B lymphoid line 70Z/3, in which no DNA rearrangement was observed. To clarify the WEHI3B alteration and normal Hox-2.4 structure, we have sequenced near full length cDNA clones from WEHI3B and 70Z/3, and the 5' portion of the normal Hox-2.4 gene. A WEHI3B cDNA clone demonstrates that an intracisternal A-particle (IAP) provirus has inserted within the first exon of the gene and generated a Hox-2.4 mRNA with a 5' sequence derived from the IAP long terminal repeat. A remarkable degree of similarity found between the amino acid sequences of Hox-2.4 and Hox-3.1, which reside on different chromosomes, supports the notion that an ancient homeobox gene cluster has been duplicated and dispersed early in vertebrate evolution.","['Kongsuwan, K', 'Allen, J', 'Adams, J M']","['Kongsuwan K', 'Allen J', 'Adams JM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/isolation & purification', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1989/03/11 00:00,1989/03/11 00:01,['1989/03/11 00:00'],"['1989/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1989 Mar 11;17(5):1881-92. doi: 10.1093/nar/17.5.1881.,0305-1048 (Print) 0305-1048 (Linking),,['10.1093/nar/17.5.1881 [doi]'],['CA12421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC317530,,,['GENBANK/X13721'],,,,,

The drug-resistant cells, MCF-7/ADR and HL60/ADR, were selected for resistance to adriamycin and were 200- to 250-fold resistant to VP-16. Whereas MCF-7/ADR cells overexpress the P-170 glycoprotein and show the multidrug-resistant phenotype, HL60/ADR cells do not overexpress the P-170 glycoprotein. Although there was a 2-fold decrease in accumulation of VP-16 in MCF-7/ADR cells, this decrease did not correlate with a 250-fold resistance to the drug. VP-16 efflux was rapid and almost complete from MCF-7 cell lines and it was decreased at 4 degrees. Further, there was a significant increase in VP-16 accumulation in the MCF-7/ADR cells in the presence of glucose-free medium supplemented with sodium azide. However, no change in the pattern of VP-16 efflux was observed. Under these conditions, addition of glucose caused release of VP-16 from MCF-7/ADR cells, suggesting energy-dependent modifications in the drug binding. Coincubation of vincristine with VP-16 also increased the drug accumulation and decreased the rate of efflux of VP-16 in both sensitive and resistant MCF-7 cells, suggesting that vincristine and VP-16 may compete for similar binding and efflux mechanisms in these cell lines. In contrast, daunorubicin increased VP-16 accumulation only in the sensitive MCF-7 cell line, whereas the efflux rate of VP-16 was not significantly changed in either cell line. HL60 sensitive cells accumulated 4- to 5-fold more VP-16 than the resistant subline. Both sensitive and resistant cells showed an important noneffluxable pool of the drug, 3-fold larger for sensitive cells (79 +/- 12 versus 25 +/- 2 pmol of VP-16/mg of protein, for sensitive and resistant cells, respectively). The efflux of VP-16 was temperature dependent only in sensitive cells. VP-16 accumulation in HL60/ADR cells was increased in glucose-free medium supplemented with sodium azide; however, the noneffluxable pool of VP-16 was not significantly changed. In contrast, although these conditions had no effect on the drug accumulation in the parental line, they caused a decrease in the noneffluxable pool of VP-16, suggesting an energy-dependent binding and retention of VP-16.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Politi, P M', 'Sinha, B K']","['Politi PM', 'Sinha BK']","['Clinical Pharmacology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Azides)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '968JJ8C9DV (Sodium Azide)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analysis', 'Azides/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Sodium Azide', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1989/03/01 00:00,1989/03/01 00:01,['1989/03/01 00:00'],"['1989/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1989 Mar;35(3):271-8.,0026-895X (Print) 0026-895X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The hybrids between L-asparaginase sensitive (Molt4) and resistant (HL-60) cell lines revealed the latter phenotype in terms of L-asparaginase sensitivity and the activity of asparagine synthetase. Furthermore, U937 cells resistant to L-asparaginase could survive in glutamine-free media with 1.5-fold elevation of glutamine synthetase activity.

We demonstrated mutated alleles in 19% of primary AMLs (10/51) as well as in five of six secondary leukemias. Mutations occurred predominantly at N-ras codons 12, 13, or 61 (13 cases) and twice at Ki-ras codons 12 and 13. Ras gene mutations were preferentially associated with an M4 morphology according to the FAB (French-American-British) classification, but no particular correlation was observed with respect to clinical parameter (sex, age, course of disease) or immunophenotype and karyotype. Mutated ras alleles were absent in nine mutation-positive cases analyzed during remission. However, a more complex pattern emerged from the five patients analyzed in relapse exhibiting identical ras mutations in three cases, absence of a mutated allele in one patient, and acquisition of a N-ras mutation in yet another case, in which no mutation had been detected initially. Moreover, restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the X-chromosome genes hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) were studied in 19 of the AML patients. Nine cases (47%) were heterozygous for BglI or BamHI RFLPs at the PGK or HPRT loci, respectively, and therefore suitable for clonal analysis investigating X-chromosome inactivation. All of the patients exhibited a monoclonal leukemic cell population at presentation. In addition, five of seven cases studied in remission showed reemergence of a polyclonal pattern. However, two children exhibited persistence of monoclonal hematopoiesis despite complete clinical/hematological remission and a corresponding loss of a mutated ras allele in one of the patients. These data indicate the value of molecular genetic approaches for evaluation of the heterogeneous nature of remission and relapse in AML.","['Bartram, C R', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Lyons, J', 'Buschle, M', 'Ritter, J', 'Harbott, J', 'Frohlich, A', 'Janssen, J W']","['Bartram CR', 'Ludwig WD', 'Hiddemann W', 'Lyons J', 'Buschle M', 'Ritter J', 'Harbott J', 'Frohlich A', 'Janssen JW']","['Department of Pediatrics II, University of Ulm, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.2.3 (Phosphoglycerate Kinase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Female', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Phosphoglycerate Kinase/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', '*X Chromosome']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1989 Apr;3(4):247-56.,0887-6924 (Print) 0887-6924 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

CD13 antigen is a marker of myelomonocytic lineage, and biochemical analyses have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies belonging to CD13 precipitated two glycoprotein molecules of 130,000 and 150,000 molecular weight and that the former molecule (gp130) is the precursor protein of the latter (gp150).

Some inbred strains carried unique proviruses, but most Xmv loci were present in several strains, indicating that many Xmv integration events preexisted modern inbreeding. It was also clear that most Xmv junction fragment variation between inbred strains resulted from independent integration events and not modification or restriction site polymorphism following integration. Chromosomal assignments were determined for 32 Xmv loci by comparing their recombinant inbred strain distribution patterns to those of known genetic markers. The Xmv loci were generally dispersed throughout the genome, but several chromosomal regions contained more than one provirus. Furthermore, several close genetic associations with cellular genes were discovered. Four Xmv loci were closely linked to Fv-1b, a dominant viral resistance gene present in C57BL/6J, BALB/cJ, A/J, and several other strains. Xmv-28 was closely linked to rd (retinal degeneration), and Xmv-10 was closely linked to a (non-agouti), both of which are old mutations as inferred from their broad distribution in mice. We suggest that Xmv integration contributed to genetic diversity in the past and that much of this diversity exists today in common laboratory strains.","['Frankel, W N', 'Stoye, J P', 'Taylor, B A', 'Coffin, J M']","['Frankel WN', 'Stoye JP', 'Taylor BA', 'Coffin JM']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",1989/04/01 00:00,1989/04/01 00:01,['1989/04/01 00:00'],"['1989/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Apr;63(4):1763-74. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.4.1763-1774.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.4.1763-1774.1989 [doi]'],"['CA33093/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM18684/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R35-CA44385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC248440,,,,,,,,

M., Howard, M. J., Motulsky, H. J., and Insel, P. A. (1987) Mol. Pharmacol. 32, 258-265). Using Fura-2, we show that alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation also increases intracellular Ca2+ in these cells by 80-250 nM. Although epinephrine only inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP generation when beta-adrenergic receptors were blocked, the Ca2+ increase was not affected by beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The Ca2+ increase was not affected by forskolin or 8-bromo-cAMP. Thus, alpha 2-adrenergic receptors independently couple to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and adenylate cyclase inhibition. Chelating all extracellular Ca2+ did not reduce the response, demonstrating mobilization of intracellular, rather than influx of extracellular Ca2+. The epinephrine-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization occurred prior to any detectable increase in inositol-(1,4,5)-trisphosphate. It was abolished by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (which blocks some G protein-mediated processes), but not by aspirin and indomethacin (which inhibit cyclooxygenase), nordihydroguaiaretic acid (which inhibits lipoxygenase), or Na+-free buffer (to block any Na+H+ exchange). We conclude, therefore, that alpha 2-adrenergic receptors on human erythroleukemia cells couple to mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ via a (pertussis toxin-sensitive) G protein-mediated mechanism that is independent of inhibition of adenylate cyclase.","['Michel, M C', 'Brass, L F', 'Williams, A', 'Bokoch, G M', 'LaMorte, V J', 'Motulsky, H J']","['Michel MC', 'Brass LF', 'Williams A', 'Bokoch GM', 'LaMorte VJ', 'Motulsky HJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adrenergic alpha-Agonists)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adrenergic alpha-Agonists/pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Cyclic GMP/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Space/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha/drug effects/*physiology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers']",1989/03/25 00:00,1989/03/25 00:01,['1989/03/25 00:00'],"['1989/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1989/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Mar 25;264(9):4986-91.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(18)83688-2 [pii]'],"['HL33262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL40387/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,['J Biol Chem 1989 Oct 5;264(28):16963'],,,,,,,

The mean number of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) collected was significantly higher in the complete remission group (n = 22) than in the partial remission group (n = 9). Fifty x 10(4) CFU-GM/kg body weight or more, which produced rapid, complete and sustained haemopoietic reconstitution after autografting in our patients, were collected from six of nine patients who underwent three or four 7-litre aphereses over 5-7 days using a lymphocyte collection procedure on the Fenwal CS3000 [Protocol B] but only from two of 12 patients who underwent three or four 5-litre aphereses over 3-5 days using the Aminco Celltrifuge [Protocol A] (p less than 0.05). No adverse effects on the rates of neutrophil, platelet and lymphocyte recovery after induction chemotherapy or on long-term disease-free survival for patients who achieved a complete remission could be attributed to apheresis when compared with a historical control group of 39 patients who achieved complete remission following the same induction chemotherapy but did not undergo apheresis.

To test this hypothesis with BCNU, DBA/2J male mice were given a single injection of cimetidine (CMT 100 mg/kg) or ranitidine (RNT 25 mg) at various times up to 30 min before, or up to 60 min after a BCNU injection.

In P-388 leukemia-bearing DBA/2J mice, both CMT and RNT significantly enhanced the antitumor effects of BCNU doses of 30 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic analyses of BCNU elimination in Cd-1 mice showed marked prolongation of BCNU elimination and increased (BCNU concentration) x time products when CMT was concomitantly administered. These results demonstrate that enhanced BCNU bone marrow toxicity and antitumor activity is produced by CMT.

Doxorubicin-resistant (L1210dox) and daunorubicin-resistant L1210 ascites tumor cells (L1210dnr) (multidrug-resistant tumor cells) were therefore compared with cytosine-arabino-side-resistant (L1210AraC) and cyclophosphamide-resistant L1210 ascites tumor cells (L1210ctx) (not multi-drug-resistant tumor cells). The resistant cell lines were generated in vivo in tumor-bearing mice and the resistance to cytostatic agents was evaluated in vivo and in vitro. Using the accumulation assay with rhodamine-123, the multidrug resistance can be detected. In order to determine alterations in the plasma membranes we used the monoclonal antibodies 265/F4 and C219, which were prepared against the membrane glycoprotein P170 (170 kDa) in colchicin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results demonstrate that L1210dox and L1210dnr tumor cells show an intense immunostaining by the streptavidin/biotinylated-peroxidase-complex method and by the streptavidin/biotin/phycoerythrin immunofluorescence method. In contrast no specific immunostaining was observed in parental (sensitive) and L1210AraC or L1210ctx tumor lines. The results were confirmed by immunoblotting. To determine whether multidrug-resistant DNA sequences were expressed in the multidrug-resistant tumor cells, Northern blots with RNA od sensitive and resistant cells were performed using the clone pcDR1.5. Elevated RNA levels were detected only in resistant cells with the multidrug-resistant phenotype. Thus, the results of this study demonstrate that only resistant cells with the multidrug-resistant phenotype show an increased expression of the membrane 170-kDa glycoprotein.","['Volm, M', 'Bak, M Jr', 'Efferth, T', 'Mattern, J']","['Volm M', 'Bak M Jr', 'Efferth T', 'Mattern J']","['German Cancer Research Center, Institute of Experimental Pathology, Heidelberg.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Phenotype']",1989/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1989;115(1):17-24. doi: 10.1007/BF00391594.,0171-5216 (Print) 0171-5216 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF00391594 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

C25X cells were cross-resistant to daunomycin and etoposide (VP-16) but not to vincristine or colchicine. These cells were not defective in the cellular accumulation of drug and did not contain detectable levels of P-glycoprotein. Continued exposure of C25X cells to adriamycin resulted in increased levels of resistance and additional phenotypic changes. These cells (C80X) now contained high levels of P-glycoprotein and were cross-resistant to a variety of agents including vincristine and colchicine. A fluorometric assay for DNA unwinding was used to measure levels of drug-induced DNA breaks in sensitive and C25X resistant cells. Studies carried out with VP-16, 4'9-acridinyl-aminomethanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), adriamycin, or daunomycin showed that the level of drug-induced DNA strand breakage in resistant cells was considerably less than that occurring in drug-treated sensitive cells. These studies, therefore, show that treatment of CEM cells with adriamycin resulted in a nuclear alteration that contributed to drug resistance. They also demonstrate that prolonged treatment of cells with adriamycin resulted in membrane alterations that affect cellular drug accumulation. Adriamycin resistance in CEM cells can thus occur as a result of at least two distinct mechanisms.","['McGrath, T', 'Marquardt, D', 'Center, M S']","['McGrath T', 'Marquardt D', 'Center MS']","['Division of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan 66506.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Feb 1;38(3):497-501. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90390-0.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90390-0 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90390-0 [doi]']",['CA-37585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The amino acid sequence for the human neutrophil alpha M subunit contains regions that are closely related to amino acid sequences of adhesion receptors belonging to the integrin family.","['Hickstein, D D', 'Hickey, M J', 'Ozols, J', 'Baker, D M', 'Back, A L', 'Roth, G J']","['Hickstein DD', 'Hickey MJ', 'Ozols J', 'Baker DM', 'Back AL', 'Roth GJ']","['Medical Research Division, Seattle Veterans Administration Medical Center, WA 98108.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Proteins/*genetics', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD18 Antigens', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neutrophils/*immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Jan;86(1):257-61. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.1.257.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.86.1.257 [doi]'],['HL39947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC286443,,,['GENBANK/J04145'],,,,,

These data are compatible with the notion that TdT acts as somatic mutagen on TCR beta genes starting only after 20 weeks of gestation.

The current study evaluated the F-MuLV antigenic determinants expressed on FBL that are recognized by FBL-reactive CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. To identify the specificity of the FBL-reactive CD8+ CTL, Fisher rat embryo fibroblast (FRE) cells transfected with plasmids encoding F-MuLV gag or envelope (env) gene products plus the class I-restricting element Db were utilized. FBL-reactive CTL recognized FRE target cells transfected with the F-MuLV gag-encoded gene products, but failed to recognize targets expressing F-MuLV env. Attempts to generate env-specific CD8+ CTL by immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus containing an inserted F-MuLV env gene were unsuccessful, despite the generation of a cytolytic response to vaccinia epitopes, implying that B6 mice fail to generate CD8+ CTL to env determinants. By contrast, CD4+ Th clones recognized FRE target cells transfected with env and not gag genes, and immunization with the recombinant vaccinia virus induced an env-specific CD4+ T cell response. These data show that in a Friend retrovirus-induced tumor model in which tumor rejection can be mediated by either CTL or Th, antigens derived from discrete retroviral proteins are predominantly responsible for activation of each T cell subset.","['Klarnet, J P', 'Kern, D E', 'Okuno, K', 'Holt, C', 'Lilly, F', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Klarnet JP', 'Kern DE', 'Okuno K', 'Holt C', 'Lilly F', 'Greenberg PD']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics/*immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/immunology']",1989/02/01 00:00,1989/02/01 00:01,['1989/02/01 00:00'],"['1989/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1989 Feb 1;169(2):457-67. doi: 10.1084/jem.169.2.457.,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007 (Linking),,['10.1084/jem.169.2.457 [doi]'],"['CA-01192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30588/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2189204,,,,,,,,

Initially used for the treatment of immunodeficiency where a cell series or product is replaced, it has now become routine treatment for many forms of leukemia where the transplant provides the rescue after lethal marrow ablation. Recently, diseases such as thalassemia and other inherited metabolic diseases have also been treated by BMT. Formerly the problems of BMT were mainly concerned with graft versus host disease (GVHD) in HLA-matched transplants with HLA-mismatched ones not being possible as GVHD was usually fatal. Since the development of techniques for T cell removal the incidence of GVHD has greatly diminished. T cell removal has also allowed HLA haploidentical mismatched grafts to be performed successfully for immunodeficiency, but there is still a high graft rejection rate in leukemia. This also occurs to a lesser extent with HLA-matched grafts in leukemia. Furthermore, in certain forms of leukemia, particularly chronic granulocytic leukemia, the relapse rate after T cell-depleted BMT is much higher. Trials of better forms of bone marrow conditioning of the recipient are being attempted in order to prevent graft rejection and leukemia relapse. These include total lymphoid irradiation, heavier irradiation and chemotherapeutic regimens, or the use of in vivo monoclonal antibodies such as CAMPATH 1G or anti-LFA-1 (CD11a). In the future, positive selection of stem cells combined with hemopoietic growth factors may allow engraftment without graft versus host disease. This should become the method of choice for autologous transplantation for malignancy. Two monoclonal antibodies directed against the human progenitor cell antigen 1 (HPCA-1) (CD34) have been used for autologous positive stem cell selection in primates and these cells gave full hemopoietic reconstitution in the animals following lethal total body irradiation.","['Levinsky, R J']",['Levinsky RJ'],"['Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Diseases/surgery', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 Jan;50(1 Pt 2):S124-32. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(89)90119-0.,0090-1229 (Print) 0090-1229 (Linking),,['10.1016/0090-1229(89)90119-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,32,,,

In eight patients showing PGK polymorphisms, clonality was determined by X-chromosome inactivation analysis. These included patients from different morphologic subtypes: four with refractory anemia (RA), two with RA and ring sideroblasts (RARS), one patient with RA with excess of blasts (RAEB), and one with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). A monoclonal pattern of X-chromosome inactivation was observed in seven cases. In a further case characterized by bone marrow hypoplasia, peripheral blood (PB) leukocytes were polyclonal in origin. Following low-dose cytarabine therapy, reversion to polyclonal hematopoiesis was observed in a case of RAEB indicating the presence of residual normal hematopoietic stem cells with the capacity for marrow reconstitution. The clonal relation of lymphoid and granulocyte/monocyte lineages was studied directly in two cases of CMML exhibiting somatic mutations of N-ras or Ki-ras oncogenes. By selective oligonucleotide hybridization to ras gene sequences amplified in vitro by the polymerase chain reaction, a mutated ras allele was demonstrated in PB granulocytes, monocytes, and B and T lymphocytes of both patients.

We found that approximately one half of these animals died of malignant lymphoma by the age of 16 months. Splenic enlargement was seen in all mice, but thymic involvement was unusual. One half of the CWD tumors were diffuse lymphoblastic or immunoblastic lymphomas while the remainder were large cell, small cell, or mixed cell lymphomas. Analysis of DNAs from 12 tumors for immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements revealed that all six of the lymphoblastic and immunoblastic lymphomas were of T-cell origin, as was one tumor of small cleaved cells. Four of the others were clonal B-cell lymphomas and one was of uncertain lineage. Assays of a limited number of tumors for the expression of the Thy 1.2 and IgM molecules confirmed the diversity in the cellular phenotype. The results indicate that CWD mice develop primarily splenic lymphomas with an unusual degree of heterogeneity in the tumor cell phenotypes as compared with the thymic lymphomas found in other high leukemia strains.

Differentiation of these cells along both a monocytic and a granulocytic pathway demonstrated that the mRNA levels of the two subunits of CD11b/CD18 increased in a pattern temporally and quantitatively similar to the increase in cell surface expression of this heterodimer. In contrast, the expression of MPO mRNA decreased in a temporal and quantitative pattern similar to the known decrease in MPO protein during differentiation, suggesting that regulation of these myeloid-specific proteins may occur at the level of mRNA expression. These findings have important implications with regard to the nature of the block in differentiation in acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and the regulation of myeloid gene expression.","['Rosmarin, A G', 'Weil, S C', 'Rosner, G L', 'Griffin, J D', 'Arnaout, M A', 'Tenen, D G']","['Rosmarin AG', 'Weil SC', 'Rosner GL', 'Griffin JD', 'Arnaout MA', 'Tenen DG']","['Charles A.

However, other cancers are intrinsically drug resistant, and some acquire resistance following chemotherapy. Cloning of the cDNA for the human MDR1 gene (also known as PGY1), which encodes the multidrug efflux protein P-glycoprotein, has made it possible to measure levels of MDR1 RNA in human cancers. We report the levels of MDR1 RNA in greater than 400 human cancers. MDR1 RNA levels were usually elevated in untreated, intrinsically drug-resistant tumors, including those derived from the colon, kidney, adrenal gland, liver, and pancreas, as well as in carcinoid tumors, chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis, and cell lines of non-small cell carcinoma of the lung (NSCLC) with neuroendocrine properties. MDR1 RNA levels were occasionally elevated in other untreated cancers, including neuroblastoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in adults, acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) in adults, and indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. MDR1 RNA levels were also increased in some cancers at relapse after chemotherapy, including ALL, ANLL, breast cancer, neuroblastoma, pheochromocytoma, and nodular, poorly differentiated lymphoma. Many types of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tumors, including NSCLC and melanoma, contained undetectable or low levels of MDR1 RNA. The consistent association of MDR1 expression with several intrinsically resistant cancers and the increased expression of the MDR1 gene in certain cancers with acquired drug resistance indicate that the MDR1 gene contributes to multidrug resistance in many human cancers. Thus, evaluation of MDR1 gene expression may prove to be a valuable tool in the identification of individuals whose cancers are resistant to specific agents. The information may be useful in designing or altering chemotherapeutic protocols in these patients.","['Goldstein, L J', 'Galski, H', 'Fojo, A', 'Willingham, M', 'Lai, S L', 'Gazdar, A', 'Pirker, R', 'Green, A', 'Crist, W', 'Brodeur, G M']","['Goldstein LJ', 'Galski H', 'Fojo A', 'Willingham M', 'Lai SL', 'Gazdar A', 'Pirker R', 'Green A', 'Crist W', 'Brodeur GM', 'et al.']","['Division of Cancer Biology and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis']",1989/01/18 00:00,1989/01/18 00:01,['1989/01/18 00:00'],"['1989/01/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/18 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1989 Jan 18;81(2):116-24. doi: 10.1093/jnci/81.2.116.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),,['10.1093/jnci/81.2.116 [doi]'],"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Mice inoculated with L1210 lymphoma or colon 38 carcinoma, however, revealed enhanced efficacy which was greater than additive. The data also reveal that combination of IFNs alpha and gamma administered to normal and tumor-bearing mice resulted in toxicity which was not predicted by the appropriate doses of the single agents.

While we have refined various categories with prognostic clinical value regarding possible associated systemic disease, none is foolproof and all have varying degrees of unpredictability. Comparatively well-differentiated histologic subtypes predominate among ocular adnexal lymphoid tumors. Polyclonal lesions occur less than half as often as monoclonal B-cell lesions. Molecular genetic studies have revealed small clones of monoclonal populations among the B-cells comprising most of the immunophenotypically polyclonal lesions, but no clonal genetic rearrangements have been uncovered within the preponderant constituent T-cell populations. The overall prognosis for ocular adnexal lymphoid tumors is excellent; when lumped together, 67% are not found to be associated with systemic disease with mean follow-ups of over 4 years. This is similar to experience with extranodal and extralymphatic lesions in other sites of the body, which also frequently have a small lymphocyte composition. The incidence of nonocular disease in all categories of our studies, however, will probably increase with the acquisition of longer follow-ups. Careful histopathologic evaluation is as good as immunophenotypic analysis of these lesions in predicting clinical outcome in terms of associated nonocular disease. Polyclonal and well-differentiated B-cell monoclonal lesions displayed equivalent clinical behavior. Benign polyclonal lesions may be associated with systemic disease but in a minority of cases (27%), as has also been determined in earlier studies. Clinical staging is the single most important predictor of associated monocular disease. In this study, patients with stage I-E disease had an 87% chance of not developing any nonocular lymphomatous lesion. We believe that this figure may also somewhat decrease with the passage of time. Precise anatomic localization of the lesion within the adnexa had considerable predictive value. Lesions of the conjunctiva fared the best; those of the orbit had an intermediate prognosis; while lid lesions had the worst prognosis. The most favorable prognosis would be held by a conjunctival lymphoid lesion in stage I-E composed of small lymphocytes. The fact that there is a fairly close equivalence in outcome between polyclonal and monoclonal well-differentiated lesions indicates that these lesions are in the vast majority of cases primary hyperplasias or primary lymphomas. The discovery by genetic probes of small monoclonal populations in immunophenotypically polyclonal lesions suggests that there is an evolution that goes on in situ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jakobiec, F A', 'Knowles, D M']","['Jakobiec FA', 'Knowles DM']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Boston.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc,Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society,7506106,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Conjunctival Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eyelid Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Trans Am Ophthalmol Soc. 1989;87:420-42; discussion 442-4.,0065-9533 (Print) 0065-9533 (Linking),,,['EY-06337/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC1298553,,,,,,,,

We find that these cells efficiently join D beta segments to J beta segments within the mini-locus, but that they do not make any detectable site-specific rearrangements of the introduced V beta segment even though it is closely linked in the same construct to the D beta. These findings suggest that factors necessary for V beta to (D beta)J beta joining may be absent in these pre-B cells and also imply that the order in which TCR V beta, D beta, and J beta segments are rearranged can be influenced by factors other than the 12/23 recombination rule. Furthermore, in agreement with the an accessibility model of VDJ recombinase control, the D beta region of the construct was found to be relatively more sensitive to DNAase I digestion in isolated nuclei when compared to the unrearranged V beta region.","['Ferrier, P', 'Covey, L R', 'Suh, H', 'Winoto, A', 'Hood, L', 'Alt, F W']","['Ferrier P', 'Covey LR', 'Suh H', 'Winoto A', 'Hood L', 'Alt FW']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Deoxyribonucleases', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Models, Genetic', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Immunol. 1989;1(1):66-74. doi: 10.1093/intimm/1.1.66.,0953-8178 (Print) 0953-8178 (Linking),,['10.1093/intimm/1.1.66 [doi]'],"['AI-20047/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40427/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

There were direct relations between inhibition of de novo pyrimidine synthesis, changes in pyrimidine nucleotide concentrations, and cell proliferation following short (less than 24 hr) drug exposures; with prolonged exposures (greater than 24 hr), however, there was a departure from these relationships in that restoration of pyrimidine nucleotide pools and de novo pyrimidine pathway activity did not restore cell proliferation.

This has been principally due to the use of chemotherapy, centralization of care and treatment by standard protocols. With increasing numbers of children and adolescents cured of cancer there has been an increased awareness of the late effects of therapy. The recent recognition of disease-specific prognostic factors has permitted the subclassification of tumours into good and bad risk. The aim for those malignancies associated with a good outcome is the reduction of late adverse effects, eg intellectual impairment in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia receiving central nervous system irradiation. In those diseases which have a poor prognosis with present therapy, new innovative and intensive regimens are being investigated in randomized trials. Neuroblastoma is a chemosensitive tumour but there has been little success in translating response into improvements in long-term cure. In poor prognosis neuroblastoma conventional combination chemotherapy, high dose therapy with autologous bone marrow rescue as consolidation and more recently high dose, or high dose rapid schedule, chemotherapy as initial treatment have been sequentially evaluated. In paediatric brain tumours only now are well designed phase II studies being undertaken and problems associated with the classification and evaluation of response to therapy are being addressed. In the past 30 years much of the success with childhood cancer has been largely empirical and the hope for the future is that there will be a more scientific approach to the chemotherapy of childhood malignancy.","['Craft, A W', 'Pearson, A D']","['Craft AW', 'Pearson AD']","['Department of Child Health, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Neuroblastoma/drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Wilms Tumor/drug therapy']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1989;8(3):605-29.,0261-2429 (Print) 0261-2429 (Linking),,,,,,,,,71,,,

Whether this observation is a result of lowered transcription or of mRNA instability is under investigation. In an effort to determine which viral sequences are essential for mediating both the H-2 regulatory function and the transforming function of RadLV, we have begun to assemble newly integrated proviral genomes from tumours.

An integrated copy of the non-mammalian 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase gene in WEHI-3B D+ Y1 cells permitted the unambiguous identification of these leukemia cells in vivo by in situ hybridization. The administration of aclacinomycin A to BALB/c mice bearing this leukemia produced an increase in survival time. In situ analyses of peritoneal cells obtained from anthracycline-treated animals supported the concept that the increase in life-span was due in part to the induced maturation of WEHI-3B D+ Y1 cells to more mature granulocytic elements. This action was accompanied by an order of magnitude decrease, relative to vehicle-treated animals, in the peritoneal leukemic cell burden. The schedule and dosage of the anthracycline antibiotic that produced the maximum prolongation of life had no effect on peripheral platelet levels or packed red cell volume. Elevated white blood cell levels were observed in leukemia-bearing mice; these increases were reversed in animals receiving 2 mg/kg of aclacinomycin A and reached control levels by day 8. Treatment with aclacinomycin A had no effect on body weight, or femoral or splenic cellularity. Increased numbers of granulocyte-macrophage colony forming units were observed in leukemia-bearing animals.

Much of this is based on the observation that phosphorylation of topoisomerase II by protein kinase C may lead to its activation in vitro and that inhibitors of topoisomerase II block phorbol diester-induced differentiation in HL-60 cells. In the present study, the activities of the DNA topoisomerases I and II have been quantitated to examine their regulation in phorbol diester-treated HL-60 cells undergoing differentiation. The activity of topoisomerase I increased rapidly after treatment with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA); it increased maximally (150% of control activity) at 3 hr post-treatment and remained elevated for at least 24 hr. Conversely, from the onset of exposure to PMA through 12 hr, there was no measurable alteration in topoisomerase II activity in PMA-treated cells. Moreover, there was a measurable decrease in topoisomerase II activity at the later time points, a result that occurred concomitantly with the loss of proliferative potential in differentiating HL-60 cells. Similar results were obtained when the activities of both enzymes were measured in nuclear extracts. The apparent increase in topoisomerase I activity was not due to an increase in the mass of the enzyme after PMA treatment, as measured by both western blotting and by the formation of camptothecin-dependent, topoisomerase I-DNA complexes. Taken together, these data suggest that the activities of the topoisomerases I and II may have been regulated independently in PMA-treated HL-60 cells, that the activity of topoisomerase II was not increased under conditions in which protein kinase C was activated in vivo, and that an increase in the activity of topoisomerase I may have had a role in the mechanism through which HL-60 cells underwent monocytic maturation in response to phorbol diesters.","['Gorsky, L D', 'Cross, S M', 'Morin, M J']","['Gorsky LD', 'Cross SM', 'Morin MJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, IL 60611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*enzymology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(2):83-92. doi: 10.3727/095535489820875381.,0955-3541 (Print) 0955-3541 (Linking),,['10.3727/095535489820875381 [doi]'],"['CA-44589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-07124/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05370/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we found that nuclear extracts of these sublines (approximately 50- and approximately 140-fold resistant to VM-26) required 2 and 8 times more adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), respectively, to achieve half-maximal stimulation of unknotting activity compared to extracts from the sensitive cells. When novobiocin, a competitive inhibitor of ATP binding to topoisomerase II, was included in the reaction, this ATP requirement increased 2.5- to 4-fold with the CEM cell extracts and 3.5- to 12-fold with the resistant cell extracts. ATP produced a dose-dependent increase in VM-26-stabilized topoisomerase II-DNA covalent complexes with nuclear extracts from all three cell lines. Extracts from resistant cells, however, formed 40-80% fewer complexes than those from sensitive cells. A similar decrease was seen with 4'-[(9-acridinyl)amino]methanesulphon-m-anisidide, to which the cells are cross-resistant. With nuclear extracts from sensitive cells, the tetralithium salt of 5'-adenylylimidodiphosphate (AMP-PNP), a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, was as effective as ATP in promoting the formation of drug-stabilized enzyme-DNA complexes. With extracts from the resistant cell nuclei, however, AMP-PNP was about half as effective as ATP in promoting complex formation. Our results demonstrate that the effect of ATP on strand passing activity of and drug-stabilized complex formation by topoisomerase II is decreased in the nuclear extracts from the drug-resistant cells and suggest a possible basis for this form of drug resistance.","['Danks, M K', 'Schmidt, C A', 'Deneka, D A', 'Beck, W T']","['Danks MK', 'Schmidt CA', 'Deneka DA', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Biochemical and Clinical Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '25612-73-1 (Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Adenylyl Imidodiphosphate/pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/*metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Podophyllotoxin/*analogs & derivatives', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Protein Binding', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1989;1(2):101-9. doi: 10.3727/095535489820875309.,0955-3541 (Print) 0955-3541 (Linking),,['10.3727/095535489820875309 [doi]'],"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-30103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05584/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

IC50 values of K6-1 and 50B-3 cells to VP-16, evaluated by the colony forming ability on methyl cellulose medium, were 11- and 84-fold higher than their sensitive parental cell lines, respectively. Membrane permeability of the drug was not responsible for the resistance in K6-1 and 50B-3 cells. Quantitative analysis of drug-induced DNA cleavage (so called cleavable complex formation) was performed using 32P end-labeled pBR322 restriction fragments. The formation of the topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex stimulated by VP-16 in 50B-3 cells was approximately 1/5 compared with that of FM3A wild-type cells. Dot blot analysis of RNA extracted from these cell lines showed that the levels of mRNA for DNA topoisomerase II in 50B-3 cells were markedly decreased and that catalytic activity was reduced to 1/2-1/3 compared with that of parent cells. There was a slight reduction of DNA topoisomerase II mRNA in K6-1 cells. However, DNA topoisomerase II activities were similar in wild-type and K6-1 cells. In addition, 50B-3 cells showed cross resistance to VM-26, m-AMSA and adriamycin, whereas K6-1 cells exhibited increased resistance only to VM-26. These resistant cell lines did not show collateral sensitivity to CPT-11, a DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA did not show any change in the restriction pattern of the DNA topoisomerase II gene between the parental and their resistant lines. These findings suggest that the reduced levels in DNA topoisomerase II contribute to the drug resistance of 50B-3 cells.","['Hong, J H']",['Hong JH'],,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Hiroshima J Med Sci,Hiroshima journal of medical sciences,0421060,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hiroshima J Med Sci. 1989 Dec;38(4):197-207.,0018-2052 (Print) 0018-2052 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

In reticulocytes as well as other eukaryotic cells, conjugation of the polypeptide ubiquitin to proteins, an ATP-requiring process, is important for proteolysis. However, the popular view that ubiquitin functions by tagging substrates for recognition by conjugate-specific proteases should be viewed with caution. Evidence is reviewed implicating an ATP-independent high molecular weight protease (HMP) which can degrade non-ubiquitinated proteins in the ATP-dependent pathway. This protease consists of several related subunits based upon monoclonal antibody studies. HMP by itself, can account for effects of substrate amino group blockage on ATP-dependent proteolysis. Endogenous inhibitors (40 kDa and 50 kDa) have been isolated and shown to block HMP non-competitively. Unlike the soluble system in reticulocytes, the major ATP-dependent activity in mouse erythroleukemia cells is particulate in aqueous media but soluble in the presence of sucrose. Despite such differences, evidence suggests analogous inhibitory components in this system. The possibility that protease/inhibitor interaction is regulated by ATP and ubiquitin in different systems is discussed.","['Etlinger, J D', 'Gu, M', 'Li, X', 'Weitman, D', 'Rieder, R F']","['Etlinger JD', 'Gu M', 'Li X', 'Weitman D', 'Rieder RF']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, New York Medical College, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Spain,Revis Biol Celular,Revisiones sobre biologia celular : RBC,8712458,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/immunology/*physiology', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/*physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*physiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Revis Biol Celular. 1989;20:197-216.,0213-7119 (Print) 0213-7119 (Linking),,,"['R01 HL38478/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0I AM12401/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,61,,,

OKT3 also mimicked the previously reported effects of protein kinase C since it potentiated the cAMP stimulation by either an adenosine analogue, NECA, or cholera toxin.

The two unidirectional routes show considerable similarities in energy-dependence and inhibitor sensitivities but can be separated by their differential inhibition by bromosulfophthalein (BSP), probenecid, and vincristine. The predominant route is inhibited by BSP and vincristine, whereas the other route is sensitive to probenecid. A search for additional anion substrates for the unidirectional efflux systems for methotrexate led to the finding that cholate exits L1210 cells via the same two unidirectional efflux systems as methotrexate. Cholate efflux is carrier-mediated, energy-dependent, and unidirectional, and it can be inhibited by several compounds which inhibit the efflux of methotrexate. Moreover, the same concentration of each compound which produced a half-maximal inhibition of methotrexate efflux also inhibited the efflux of cholate by 50%. Cholate efflux occurred predominantly (85%) via the BSP-sensitive route. The observation that methotrexate and cholate share the same efflux systems in L1210 cells suggest that perhaps other large anions are also accommodated by these systems since methotrexate and cholate differ in net negative charge and have few common structural features. The hypothesis advanced from these studies has been that the function of the unidirectional efflux systems is to extrude various organic anion catabolites which might otherwise become toxic if allowed to accumulate within cells. Possible intracellular anions in this latter category include sulfonated or carboxylated steroids, bilirubin, and products of vitamin D and prostaglandin catabolism. Unidirectional efflux pumps have been identified for other anionic compounds including cyclic AMP and oxidized glutathione, and in both cases similarities were apparent with the efflux of methotrexate and cholate. The most compelling comparison was with prostaglandin A1 which inhibited the efflux of cyclic AMP, methotrexate, and cholate half-maximally at the same low concentration of 0.1 microM. Energy-dependent unidirectional efflux pumps for large neutral or cationic drugs have also been identified in cells with acquired multidrug resistance. The latter efflux activity is thought to be mediated by a membrane glycoprotein (p170) which is also sensitive to several of the various inhibitors (reserpine, verapamil, and quinidine) which reduce the efflux of methotrexate and cholate.","['Henderson, G B']",['Henderson GB'],"['Department of Basic and Clinical Research, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Cholic Acids)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions/metabolism', 'Biological Transport/physiology', 'Cholic Acids/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uric Acid/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;29:61-72. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90094-0.,0065-2571 (Print) 0065-2571 (Linking),,['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90094-0 [doi]'],['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The GSH content of B-CLL lymphocytes is depleted after a 20-hr incubation. An inability to maintain its GSH content may contribute to this cell's vulnerability to CLB.

Further, several uptake routes may exist in a given cell type. A variety of neoplastic tissues have been reported to rely upon a single major transport system that has a relatively high affinity for the reduced form of folate compounds and for antifolates such as methotrexate. Using a photoaffinity analogue of methotrexate, we have identified the involvement of a 48 kDa membrane protein and a 38 kDa cytosolic or peripheral membrane protein in the transport of this compound into murine L1210 leukemia cells. Such an uptake is absent in mutant L1210 cells that are defective in methotrexate transport. We propose a model for the uptake of reduced folate coenzymes in L1210 cells in which the compound is initially transported across the cell membrane by the 48 kDa protein and delivered on the cytoplasmic surface to the 38 kDa protein; the 38 kDa protein then carries the folate compound to a specific enzyme of folate metabolism. Antibodies to the membrane folate binding protein from human placenta cross-react with the 48 kDa protein in L1210 cell membranes indicating an immunological relationship between these two proteins. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of peptides of the placental receptor obtained by digestion with S. aureus V8 protease indicate the presence of two homologous forms of the folate binding protein in placenta; one of these forms appears to have an identical sequence to the soluble and membrane associated folate binding proteins in human epidermoid carcinoma (KB) cells, which in turn share the primary structure of the soluble and membrane associated folate binders in human milk in the regions that have been sequenced. These results indicate that the folate coenzyme transport proteins in various tissues may be structurally related and in several instances may even be identical. In the latter cases the observed differences in apparent molecular weights may be due to differences in glycosylation and/or proteolysis. In support of this view is our observation that the deglycosylated and/or partially proteolyzed placental receptor retains the ability to bind folate.","['Freisheim, J H', 'Price, E M', 'Ratnam, M']","['Freisheim JH', 'Price EM', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Ohio, Toledo 43699-0008.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Affinity Labels)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Coenzymes)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Affinity Labels', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Coenzymes/*metabolism', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacokinetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/analysis', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;29:13-26. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90091-5.,0065-2571 (Print) 0065-2571 (Linking),,['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90091-5 [doi]'],['CA41461/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Cytotoxicity was measured in vitro by clonogenic survival assay and in vivo by life extension assays. All three acridine derivatives protected a Lewis lung cell line in vitro against CI-921, with 9AA having the highest activity. Cellular uptake of [14C] CI-921 by cultured Lewis lung cells was unaffected by 9AA, and slightly stimulated by O-AMSA and quinacrine. 9AA protected Lewis lung cells in vitro against the cytotoxicity of amsacrine, CI-921, AC and etoposide, partially against mitoxantrone but not against doxorubicin. A similar result was obtained with the human melanoma cell line MM96, where 9AA protected against CI-921 but not against doxorubicin toxicity. 9AA protected P388 leukaemia in vivo against amsacrine, CI-921 and AC cytotoxicity, partially against etoposide but not against mitoxantrone or doxorubicin. 9AA also protected against animal toxicity caused by high dose amsacrine and partially against CI-921 toxicity.

Both chemotherapy (nimustine (ACNU), cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and methotrexate) and radiation therapy was started, however, the chemotherapy was discontinued in July 1987 because of severe anemia. The diagnosis of refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation (RAEB in T) was made by bone marrow aspiration and the patient was treated by transfusion (400-800 ml/week). In December 1987 transition to acute myeloblastic leukemia was confirmed by another bone marrow aspiration biopsy and the patient was given low dose cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C). The response was favorable in the beginning but in about two months pancytopenia became refractory and the patient died in June 1988. Clinically there was no sign of local or distal recurrences of lung cancer, and the complete remission of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was confirmed by autopsy.

More than 100 pairs of dairy cows, and a whole population of 3000 milch cows, were studied for this report. The findings revealed that a BLV-positive cow had a shorter life span than both its seronegative counterpart and the entire milch cow population. It also produced a total of 3.5% less milk and had a mean of 48 more days open than did the BLV-negative cow. The differences in survival rate were highly significant, while, at a level of 5%, those of productivity and reproductive rate were not. The implications of these findings are discussed. A highly significant correlation was also shown between BLV infection and the persistence of Trichophyton verrucosum infection in cows. The presented data indicate that BLV infection might affect the immune system of a cow to such a degree that it ceases to be productive enough to be kept within a herd.

After statistical analysis, this space-time study showed that: (1) There is a significant positive geographical correlation between the rate of incidence of BLV infection and the density of the horsefly population. (2) Seasonal variations in the incidence rate exist; the highest rates are generally observed during summer (from July of September), and the lowest during winter, spring and early summer (from November to mid-July). (3) There is a time link between the rate of sero-conversion and the variations in activity of the horsefly population.

In all inoculated animals, specific anti-BLV antibodies can be demonstrated 1 to 3 months post-inoculation (p.i.). Between 10 and 13 months p.i., a moderate but persistent lymphocytosis (PL) may be detected in about 50% of the infected animals. This hematological disorder may be, but is not necessarily, associated with the development of a lymphosarcoma and can (might) be interpreted as a true lymphoid leukemia. According to findings revealed by immunolabelling and mitogen stimulation of peripheral blood lymphocytes, BLV-induced PL appears to be a B-cell disorder. Induced lymphosarcoma appears in about 40% of infected sheep during the 6 years p.i. It too is of B-lymphocyte lineage. In vitro studies demonstrate that BLV antigen is expressed exclusively in B-lymphocytes. Yet, BLV expression is greatly stimulated in whole lymphocyte culture by the addition of T-cell mitogen. This same phenomenon occurs when the supernatant of stimulated T-lymphocyte cultures is added to isolated BLV-infected B-lymphocytes. This observation supports the hypothesis that, as is the case with other retroviruses such as HIV, BLV is able to use the regular activation machinery of the immune system for its own replication and transmission. It seems, therefore, that the leukemia-lymphoma complex in sheep may serve as an accurate experimental model for the study of the biological properties of retroviruses.","['Djilali, S', 'Parodi, A L']","['Djilali S', 'Parodi AL']","[""Laboratoire d'Anatomie Pathologique, Ecole Nationale Veterinaire d'Alfort, Maisons-Alfort, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Vet Immunol Immunopathol,Veterinary immunology and immunopathology,8002006,,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Leukemia/blood/etiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*pathogenicity', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/blood/etiology/*veterinary', 'Models, Biological', 'Retroviridae/*pathogenicity', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/blood/*etiology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Immunol Immunopathol. 1989 Oct;22(3):233-44. doi: 10.1016/0165-2427(89)90010-x.,0165-2427 (Print) 0165-2427 (Linking),,"['0165-2427(89)90010-X [pii]', '10.1016/0165-2427(89)90010-x [doi]']",,,,,,,51,,,

The patients were divided into two groups according to myeloperoxidase-(MPO) positive percentage of blast cells, namely a low (less than 50%) and high (greater than 50%) MPO group. No remarkable morphological difference of blast cells between these two groups was observed. The 38 patients with low MPO showed a significantly lower complete response rate (CR) (52.6%) than the 34 patients with high MPO (85.3%) (p = 0.003) that included 10 CAE-positive patients and 2 ANAE-positive CAE-negative patients. The low MPO group included 5 CAE-positive patients with granulocyte dysplasia and 7 additional patients with alpha naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) positivity who were chloroacetate esterase (CAE) negative. Low positivity of blast cells may be due to a defective enzyme expression in the former but also may be a reflection of 'monocytic' aberrant expression in the latter. The low MPO group in M1 with this heterogeneous population is less likely to achieve CR with chemotherapy, while the high MPO group with a higher CR rate suggests a more pure entity within the myeloblastic leukemias referred to as M1. After further refinement by eliminating 24 cases that were 'esterase positive' (ANAE and/or CAE), the results were still the same, suggesting that the more immature blast populations were in the low MPO group.","['Matsuo, T', 'Cox, C', 'Bennett, J M']","['Matsuo T', 'Cox C', 'Bennett JM']","['University of Rochester Cancer Center, Rochester, NY 14642.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,"['EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (chloroacetate esterase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1989;3(4):153-8.,0886-0238 (Print) 0886-0238 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We now demonstrate that antibody-coated K562 (using OKT9 and 345 monoclonal antibodies) are similarly only sensitive to neutrophils when TPA is added. The presence of both antibody and TPA in the cytotoxic assay resulted in significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity than in the absence of antibody; the result being consistent with a synergistic action between protein kinase C activation and Fc receptor perturbation in the neutrophil. The cytotoxicity against non-coated and antibody-coated targets was markedly inhibited, particularly against the former, by the protein kinase C inhibitor, 1-(5-isoquinoline-sulfonyl)-2-methyl piperazine (H-7). There were marked differences in the extracellular calcium dependency of the two types of cytotoxicity reactions. TPA-activated respiratory burst was unaffected by the presence of non-coated and OKT9-coated targets, whereas TPA-induced lysosomal enzyme release was significantly increased by non-coated targets and a further increase occurred in the presence of OKT9-coated K562.","['Spisani, S', 'Gavioli, R', 'Giuliani, A L', 'Traniello, S']","['Spisani S', 'Gavioli R', 'Giuliani AL', 'Traniello S']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica, Universita di Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunol Cell Biol,Immunology and cell biology,8706300,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Cell Degranulation', 'Egtazic Acid/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Muramidase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/enzymology/*immunology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Cell Biol. 1989 Dec;67 ( Pt 6):385-9. doi: 10.1038/icb.1989.55.,0818-9641 (Print) 0818-9641 (Linking),,['10.1038/icb.1989.55 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We suggest that some aspect of nuclear polyphosphoinositide metabolism is modified when the nucleus is induced to divide or to differentiate, and that this change in inositide metabolism is a very early event in the sequence leading to cell division or differentiation.","['Manzoli, F A', 'Martelli, A M', 'Capitani, S', 'Maraldi, N M', 'Rizzoli, R', 'Barnabei, O', 'Cocco, L']","['Manzoli FA', 'Martelli AM', 'Capitani S', 'Maraldi NM', 'Rizzoli R', 'Barnabei O', 'Cocco L']","['Institutes of Human Anatomy, University of Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Phosphatidylinositol Phosphates', 'Phosphatidylinositols/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes', 'Phosphorylation']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;28:25-34. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90061-7.,0065-2571 (Print) 0065-2571 (Linking),,['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90061-7 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The inhibition by MRPP monophosphate is competitive (Ki = 35 microM with the PRPP synthetase cofactor, Pi (Km = 2 mM). The nucleosides are phosphorylated to the active metabolite by adenosine kinase and these nucleoside monophosphates accumulate in the cell. beta-ARPP is a substrate, albeit poor, for adenosine deaminase and solutions of the beta-anomer of this nucleoside and its monophosphate anomerize over time to give alpha- and beta-mixtures. beta-MRPP is more resistant to adenosine deaminase and anomerization of the nucleoside and its monophosphate is negligible. The effect of treatment of cells with the nucleosides is a time-dependent and nearly universal reduction in the nucleotide content which appears to result from a reduction in the availability of PRPP for dependent metabolic pathways. In studies with the WI-L2 lymphoblasts, some of these pathways, de novo and salvage (hypoxanthine and guanine) synthesis of purine nucleotides, are more sensitive to a restriction of PRPP availability than others, i.e. de novo pyrimidine synthesis. The nucleosides have shown promise as therapeutic agents in a mouse leukemia evaluation system but may also have future use in unravelling the complex regulation of PRPP synthetase and the dependent nucleotide synthesis pathways.","['Willis, R C', 'Nord, L D', 'Fujitaki, J M', 'Robins, R K']","['Willis RC', 'Nord LD', 'Fujitaki JM', 'Robins RK']","['Department of Biochemistry, Nucleic Acid Research Institute, Costa Mesa, California 92626.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.6.1 (Ribose-Phosphate Pyrophosphokinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Phosphotransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ribonucleosides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ribose-Phosphate Pyrophosphokinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1989;28:167-82. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(89)90070-8.,0065-2571 (Print) 0065-2571 (Linking),,['10.1016/0065-2571(89)90070-8 [doi]'],,,,,,,48,,,

Its genome encodes a number of positive, differential, and negative regulatory genes, whose interplay appears to be directed at maintaining a steady, low-level virus expression. Since clinical progression and CD4 cell depletion in HIV-infected individuals appear to correlate with increase in virus expression, and continuous recruitment of new infected cells, the role for cofactors which enhance HIV production becomes significant in the pathogenesis of AIDS. Many environmental and cellular factors have been found to activate HIV. In particular, some viral agents may interact with HIV in contributing to pathogenesis. The leukemia viruses, HTLV-1 and HTLV-2, and several herpesviruses have been shown to stimulate gene expression from the HIV LTR. In addition, HIV tat gene can also activate a DNA virus (JC virus) which is associated with a neurological disease. Finally, immunosuppression by HIV is likely to reactivate latent herpesvirus infections, thus initiating a vicious cycle for further CD4 cell depletion.","['Wong-Staal, F']",['Wong-Staal F'],"['Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,"['0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1989;14(2):295-8.,0361-090X (Print) 0361-090X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The transmission of the BLV genome was effectively achieved by cocultivation of mitomycin-C-killed, virus-producing cells of the cell clone with recipient cells. In particular, human cells of neural origin were highly susceptible to BLV infection, while some other cells were resistant. The transmission of the BVL genome from virus-nonproducing cells failed which suggests the existence of virus specific receptors on the cells. The donor cells contained three integrated BLV proviruses. In recipient cells only one provirus was found. The majority of cells contained both unintegrated and integrated BLV provirus. In the cells containing the transmitted BLV, the viral genome was expressed to its protein products.

PGE1, histamine and impromidine, a potent H2-agonist, inhibited O2- formation in neutrophils induced by the chemotactic peptide, N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe) with IC50 values of 0.5 microM, 8 microM and 2 microM, respectively. The full H1-agonist and weak partial H2-agonist, betahistine, was much less potent and effective than histamine. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin mimicked the effects of histamine and PGE1 on O2- formation. The H2-antagonist, famotidine, competitively reversed histamine-induced inhibition of O2- formation with a pA2 value of 7.5. Histamine inhibited O2- formation when added prior to or after fMet-Leu-Phe. fMet-Leu-Phe-induced aggregation and release of beta-glucuronidase in neutrophils were less sensitive to inhibition by PGE1, histamine, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and forskolin than O2- formation. The inhibitor of cyclic AMP-specific phosphodiesterase, rac-4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-imidazolidinone (Ro 20-1724), additively enhanced the inhibitory effects of histamine and PGE1 on the above cell functions. In HL-60 cells differentiated by dimethyl sulfoxide or dibutyryl cyclic AMP, histamine, impromidine and PGE1 but not betahistine inhibited fMet-Leu-Phe-induced O2- formation as well.

In the present study, 5'-nucleotidase specific activity in acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), which varied in a range from undetectable to 1.4 (nmoles/min.mg protein), was enhanced by cell fractionation, from undetectable in the homogenate, up to 18.8 +/- 1.2, 6.4 +/- 0.7 and 0.68 +/- 0.12 in plasma membranes, microsomes, and cytosol fraction, respectively. In a further fractionation of the cytosol of various leukemic cells with ammonium sulfate, 5'-nucleotidase specific activity increased up to 14-fold in the 60% (NH4)2SO4 fraction, with a recovery of 1266 +/- 115%. These data suggest that 5'-nucleotidase activity in fractionated leukemic cells is higher than reported previously and that the sum of 5'-nucleotidase activity in subcellular compartments is higher than that detected in the homogenate. Furthermore, even when 5'-nucleotidase was undetectable in a homogenate, it became detectable in the plasma membranes, suggesting that its ecto-enzyme function is still active in leukemic cells. The undetectable or low 5'-nucleotidase in the homogenate is indicative of (1) the enzyme itself being in an inactive form but becoming active after the fractionations, or (2) the presence of a factor(s) that prevents the enzyme from being detected but that is separated from the enzyme by the fractionations. In both cases, the rate of nucleotide catabolism by inactive 5'-nucleotidase in rapidly proliferating leukemic cells should be slower than when the enzyme is active. The present finding is consistent with our previous findings that during normal cell aging the high 5'-nucleotidase activity is associated with senescent non-proliferating cells but low or undetectable activity with rapidly proliferating immortal cells. The implications of 5'-nucleotidase for DNA synthesis in aging and cancer are discussed.","['Sun, A S', 'Renaud, M']","['Sun AS', 'Renaud M']","['Department of Neoplastic Diseases, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY 10029.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"[""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*blood/isolation & purification"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/blood/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukocytes/*enzymology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Reference Values', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1989 Sep-Nov;219(5-6):295-302. doi: 10.1016/0921-8734(89)90031-3.,0027-5107 (Print) 0027-5107 (Linking),,"['0921-8734(89)90031-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0921-8734(89)90031-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

To evolve a possible mechanism for these beneficial effects, we determined the metabolic fate of fish oil derived n-3 fatty acids in the skin. Specifically, we incubated guinea pig epidermal enzyme preparations with [3H]eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5 n-3) and [14C]docosahexaenoic acid (22:6 n-3). Analyses of the radiometabolites revealed the transformation of these n-3 fatty acids into n-6 lipoxygenase (arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase) products: 15-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (15-HEPE) and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHE), respectively. Since 15-lipoxygenase products have been suggested as possible endogenous inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase (an enzyme which catalyzes the formation of LTB4) we tested the ability of 15-HEPE and 17-HDHE in vitro to inhibit the activity of the 5-lipoxygenase. Incubations of these metabolites with enzyme preparations from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-1) cells demonstrated that 15-HEPE (IC50 = 28 microM) and 17-HDHE (IC50 = 25 microM) are respectively potent inhibitors of RBL-I-5-lipoxygenase. The inhibitory potential of these fish oil metabolites provides a possible mechanism by which fish oil might act to decrease local cutaneous levels of LTB4, and thereby alleviate psoriatic symptoms.","['Miller, C', 'Yamaguchi, R Y', 'Ziboh, V A']","['Miller C', 'Yamaguchi RY', 'Ziboh VA']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Fish Oils)', '0 (Lipoxygenase Inhibitors)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '90780-52-2 (17-hydroxy-4,7,10,13,15,19-docosahexaenoic acid)', '97850-14-1 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13,17-eicosapentaenoic acid)', 'AAN7QOV9EA (Eicosapentaenoic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Eicosapentaenoic Acid/analogs & derivatives/*biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Epidermis/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fish Oils/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Leukotriene B4/*biosynthesis', 'Lipoxygenase Inhibitors', 'Male', 'Psoriasis/drug therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lipids. 1989 Dec;24(12):998-1003. doi: 10.1007/BF02544068.,0024-4201 (Print) 0024-4201 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02544068 [doi]'],"['AM 30679/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'AR 39040/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

We compared the photosensitivity to UVA irradiation of various human myelo-monocytic leukemic cell lines, their intra- and inter-clonal variability and correlated their photosensitivity to P12-uptake and metabolism. The fluorescence properties of pyrene were utilized for flow cytometric analysis of cell distribution with respect to P12-uptake as well as for sorting subpopulations differing in their fluorescence. Spectrofluorometric analysis of the total cell-associated fluorescence and of the cellular lipids-associated fluorescence were also carried out. Considerable heterogeneity in P12-uptake and photosensitivity was found not only among cell lines, but also in the response of different clones and among the individual cells in specific clonal populations. Within a clone, photosensitivity was related to the amount of P12 taken up by the individual cells, while among different cell lines and their clones the photosensitivity was correlated with the proportion of cellular pyrene-linked phospholipids. The larger the fraction of pyrene-linked phospholipids within the cell--the more sensitive it was to UVA-irradiation. Photosensitivity could be affected by changing the proportion of cellular pyrene-linked phospholipids. Cells treated with cAMP showed an increase in total P12-uptake, but the proportion of pyrene-linked phospholipids was reduced, resulting in lower photosensitivity. These findings, demonstrating that by manipulating lipid metabolism photosensitivity can be modified, may prove useful in a clinical setting for selective photosensitization of malignant cells.","['Fibach, E', 'Rachmilewitz, E A', 'Gatt, S']","['Fibach E', 'Rachmilewitz EA', 'Gatt S']","['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)']",IM,"['Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cyclic AMP/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lauric Acids/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Light', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Scattering, Radiation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(12):1099-104. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90155-0.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,['10.1016/0145-2126(89)90155-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Each lymphoma has been shown to have greatest specificity for cognate virus suggestive of an immune-specific receptor. The question of receptor identity has been addressed here using the RadLV-induced murine T cell lymphoma, C6VL/1, and antibodies specific for known cell surface determinants present on these cells. This lymphoma has been shown to bind both homologous and heterologous RadLV isolates, but to have greatest specificity for homologous retrovirus since homologous free virions can best block the interaction between cells and virus adhered to the wells of a microtitre plate. A clonotypic anti-TCR antibody has been shown to completely inhibit C6VL/1 binding to the homologous virus, RadLV/C6VL, but not to the heterologous virus, RadLV/VL3. Anti-CD4, anti-Thy1.2 as well as anti-H-2Kb and not anti-H-2Db antibodies were found to partially inhibit the interaction with both RadLV/C6VL and RadLV/VL3, yet neither of these virus preparations appears to be contaminated with Class I molecules as measured by radioimmunoassay. The binding interaction between C6VL/1 and RadLV/C6VL appears specifically to involve the TCR since antibody against the clonotypic site on the TCR heterodimer uniquely inhibits this interaction, while the binding of C6VL/1 to RadLV/VL3 appears to involve the H-2Kb molecule. When free virus particles were absorbed to receptors on C6VL/1, both RadLV/VL3 and RadLV/C6VL inhibited the binding of antibody to the TCR and CD4 molecules, while the binding of several anti-H-2Kb antibodies was specifically inhibited by RadLV/VL3. There are at least two known T cell surface structures involved in the interaction of the T cell lymphoma, C6VL/1, with RadLV. These are the TCR complex (comprising the TCR heterodimer and CD4), and the Class I H-2Kb molecule. Since the TCR molecule has been shown to comodulate with H-2Kb molecules when cells were cultured in the presence of anti-H-2Kb antibodies, and the CD4 and H-2Kb molecules have been shown to comodulate with the TCR on only a subpopulation of C6VL/1 cells treated with anti-TCR antibody, this suggests that the H-2Kb molecule may also be part of the larger molecular complex including CD4/8 which can form around the TCR heterodimer.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","[""O'Neill, H C""]","[""O'Neill HC""]","['Department of Experimental Pathology, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University, Canberra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Mol Cell Immunol,The Journal of molecular and cellular immunology : JMCI,8405005,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (H-2Kb protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'H-2 Antigens/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*metabolism']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Immunol. 1989;4(4):213-23.,0724-6803 (Print) 0724-6803 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

NIAID Varicella Vaccine Collaborative Study Group.,549-53,"Oka strain varicella vaccine generally has been well tolerated by children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL) in remission and has induced protection against disease caused by wild-type varicella virus. At the end of 1985, four extensive vaccine-associated rashes were reported among children on maintenance chemotherapy. Steroid therapy in the week before vaccination or in the week following vaccination was significantly associated with rash in a retrospective analysis (odds ratio = 3.84, p = 0.0006). These findings were confirmed prospectively (OR = 2.38, p less than 0.05, one-sided) in a second smaller group of children with ALL on maintenance therapy who received varicella vaccination after the end of the data collection for the initial study but before the relationship between rash and steroids was discovered. As a result of these studies, investigators have been asked to withhold steroids for 1 week before vaccination and to delay resumption of steroid therapy for at least 2 weeks after vaccination. These results should serve as a caution that vaccination of these children should be undertaken only with full knowledge of their therapeutic regimen and a thorough clinical understanding of the competing risks of varicella, vaccination and modification of the child's chemotherapy.","['Lydick, E', 'Kuter, B J', 'Zajac, B A', 'Guess, H A']","['Lydick E', 'Kuter BJ', 'Zajac BA', 'Guess HA']","['Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania 19486.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Vaccine,Vaccine,8406899,"['0 (Chickenpox Vaccine)', '0 (Steroids)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chickenpox/prevention & control', 'Chickenpox Vaccine', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Steroids/*adverse effects', 'Vaccination/adverse effects', 'Viral Vaccines/*adverse effects']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vaccine. 1989 Dec;7(6):549-53. doi: 10.1016/0264-410x(89)90281-8.,0264-410X (Print) 0264-410X (Linking),,"['0264-410X(89)90281-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0264-410x(89)90281-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Thirty-eight percent of Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines were rearranged at TcR gamma. Moreover, many pre-B cell lines were rearranged at two distinct gamma loci, V gamma 1.2 and V gamma 2. The gamma rearrangements in the pre-B cell lines were similar to those observed previously in T cell lines. V + C-containing gamma mRNA was detected in two pre-B cell lines. In all other pre-B and interleukin (IL) 3-dependent lymphoid and myeloid lines examined, smaller C gamma-containing mRNA were detected. These C gamma transcripts were independent of the genetic configuration of the gamma locus. In contrast, the TcR alpha and beta loci were in the germ-line configuration in all non-T cell lines examined and mRNA encoding these loci were not detected. When IL3-dependent lymphoid and myeloid cell lines were transformed to growth factor independence by a non-autocrine mechanism, no mRNA transcripts encoding TcR C gamma were detected. However, TcR C gamma mRNA transcripts were detected in factor-independent cell lines that arose by an autocrine mechanism. The cell cycle expression of C gamma was compared with protooncogenes and other marker genes previously shown to be cell cycle specific. mRNA transcripts encoding C gamma were detected in the highest amounts 4-8 h after IL 3, but not phorbol myristate acetate, addition. A similar time period of expression was observed with ornithine decarboxylase which has been shown to be expressed in G1 phase. These observations indicate that TcR gamma is often rearranged in pre-B cell lines and may be directly regulated by IL3 in IL3-dependent cells.","['McCubrey, J A', 'Steelman, L S', 'Risser, R G', 'McKearn, J P']","['McCubrey JA', 'Steelman LS', 'Risser RG', 'McKearn JP']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, NC 27858.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Dec;19(12):2303-8. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191219.,0014-2980 (Print) 0014-2980 (Linking),,['10.1002/eji.1830191219 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

There is statistical evidence to indicate that patients with Auer rods have a more favourable prognosis than those without.

In all AML cases studied, Scatchard graphs of the direct binding data were curvilinear, and were best fitted by curves derived from a two-binding-site model; one site with high affinity (Kd1 = 12-71 pM; 174-602 sites/cell) and the other with low affinity (Kd2 = 0.5-2.7 nM; 1137-6020 sites/cell). A cross-linking study on blast cells from one AML patient demonstrated specific bands which were similar to those reported for peripheral blood neutrophils. Furthermore, blast colony assays for the same preparations showed remarkable proliferative response to GM-CSF in the concentration range from 0.3 nM to 7.0 nM (ED50 greater than 0.7 nM). This concentration range is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that which is effective for colony formation from normal bone marrow progenitors (ED50 in equilibrium 0.1 nM). No significant correlation could be observed between the responsiveness of blast progenitors to GM-CSF, and the numbers or affinities of GM-CSF binding sites demonstrated on blast cells. In studies with neoplastic lymphoid cells from four patients, 125I-GM-CSF also specifically bound in two cases, while response to GM-CSF was not observed in these cases. These results indicate that the expression of GM-CSF receptor is not restricted to the GM-CSF-responsive AML blast cells, but can be observed in other AML blast cells and even in neoplastic lymphoid cells.","['Piao, Y F', 'Chiba, S', 'Tojo, A', 'Urabe, A', 'Nara, N', 'Miyazono, K', 'Takaku, F']","['Piao YF', 'Chiba S', 'Tojo A', 'Urabe A', 'Nara N', 'Miyazono K', 'Takaku F']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Growth Substances/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*analysis', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1989 Sep;80(9):887-94. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01731.x.,0910-5050 (Print) 0910-5050 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01731.x [doi]'],,PMC5917862,,,,,,,,

The probability of seroconversion after rectal palpation was equal to 0.034, and results of logistic regression, using data from 1,116 noninfected and 1,047 infected cows, did not indicate any significant association between probability of seroconversion after rectal palpation and prevalence of infection (P = 0.189).

This stimulation of BLV expression has been shown to be due to enhanced transcription of the viral genome by a PHA-induced protein. We have investigated the binding of 125I-labelled PHA to BLV-infected bovine B lymphocytes and subsequent events that may lead to the stimulation of BLV-p25 synthesis. We found that PHA binding to the infected cells were rapid, but only a small fraction of the bound PHA is translocated to nucleus. However, bound PHA dissociated rapidly from the cell membrane, but not from the nucleus when PHA is removed from the culture medium. Furthermore, continuous presence of PHA was not essential for optimal stimulatory activity, instead a minimum incubation with PHA for 6 hr. followed by culturing the infected cells in its absence, was sufficient to exhibit maximal stimulatory activity. Our results raise the possibility that interaction of PHA with the plasma membrane probably triggers synthesis of a protein which in turn enhances the transcription of BLV genome in vitro.","['Chatterjee, R', 'Gupta, P']","['Chatterjee R', 'Gupta P']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",India,Indian J Exp Biol,Indian journal of experimental biology,0233411,"['0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/microbiology', 'Cattle', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Phytohemagglutinins/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/biosynthesis/genetics']",1989/05/01 00:00,1989/05/01 00:01,['1989/05/01 00:00'],"['1989/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Indian J Exp Biol. 1989 May;27(5):430-6.,0019-5189 (Print) 0019-5189 (Linking),,,['CA 42732-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

EC- and National Regulations. Since 1988 the EC-regulations accept in addition to the on Agar Gel Immunodiffusion test (AGIDT) based blood serum testing of cattle herds that are filed as ""free from Enzootic Bovine Leucosis"" the use of ELISA for this purpose. The regular testings in dairy cattle herds can be done alternatively with single or pooled milk samples, in other herds with pooled blood sera using ELISA. General condition is only a minimal sensitivity of the test to detect the European EBL Antibody Standard (""E4"") in a dilution of 1:10 in negative serum or 1:250 in negative milk. Adequate national regulations are in preparation. The present limitation of pool sizes, blood maximum 50 animals without preparation steps 20, and milk after concentration treatment 50 cows is neutralized by proceedings in development of higher sensitive ELISA tests. This limitation should be canceled. Herd bulk milk samples without size limitations are accepted to be tested with ""Milk Ring Test"" by EC for the regular testings in filed ""Brucellosis Free Dairy Cattle Herds"". The alternative use of more sensitive (and more specific) ELISA tests for this purpose including the technical conditions is in a final discussion. 2. Scientific-Technical Base for Using the Chances of the Proceeding in the EC-Regulations. The realisation of the EC accepted or final discussed ELISA based bulk milk testing to control filed ""EBL- and/or Brucellosis Free Herds"" depends on some basic conditions like sensitivity, specificity, and variability of the ELISA systems. Field trials of more than 20,000 bulk milk samples in case of Brucellosis and more than 2,000 in case of EBL show the feasibilities and the limits of the ELISA systems in defining the status of the herds. The Brucellosis respectively the EBL situations of the dairy cattle herds tested in this trail were well known by history and by investigation of single animal blood samples using conventional tests. Special test run variations of pretested assays demonstrated the possibilities to define the EBL status of dairy cattle herds up to 50 lactating cows without preparation of the bulk milk sample and up 100 after concentration of the antibodies by the rennet-ammonium sulfate method. The concentration limit for detection of Brucellosis antibodies is 100 lactating cows. The bulk milk of smaller herds can be tested without concentration.

Ledakrin-induced DNA-protein crosslinks were not readily reversible nor were they accompanied by DNA double-strand breaks. Also, ledakrin produced virtually no crosslinks in isolated nuclei. Ledakrin-induced DNA-protein crosslinks seemed not to be mediated by topoisomerase II, unlike well-established effects of a chemically related antitumor drug, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA). Four ledakrin analogs of divergent cytotoxic potencies also induced DNA-protein crosslinks but not DNA double-strand breaks in intact L1210 cells. A significant positive correlation existed between the ability of ledakrin and its 1-nitro analogs to induced DNA-protein crosslinks and the antiproliferative effects of these drugs. The results are consistent with the previously shown ability of 1-nitro-9-aminoacridines to covalently bind to macromolecules after metabolic activation in the cell. In addition to previously demonstrated DNA interstrand crosslinks and monofunctional adducts, DNA-protein crosslinks constitute another type of DNA lesion induced by 1-nitro-9-aminoacridines.","['Woynarowski, J M', 'McNamee, H', 'Szmigiero, L', 'Beerman, T A', 'Konopa, J']","['Woynarowski JM', 'McNamee H', 'Szmigiero L', 'Beerman TA', 'Konopa J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Technical University, Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Aminoacridines)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '712MLZ30SB (Nitracrine)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Aminoacridines/*pharmacology', 'Amsacrine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Cross-Linking Reagents', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Nitracrine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*metabolism']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1989 Nov 15;38(22):4095-101. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(89)90691-6.,0006-2952 (Print) 0006-2952 (Linking),,"['0006-2952(89)90691-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(89)90691-6 [doi]']",['CA-24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The cell medium was completely devoid of added proteins and hormones other than insulin. The HL-60 cell was able to grow and differentiate in this medium. The spontaneous differentiation along the granulocytic pathway after 72 hr, as assessed by the Nitro Blue tetrazolium test, increased by 400% compared to the serum supplemented medium, but the response to 1 microM retinoic acid was equal in the two media. Induction of monocytic differentiation by 0.16 microM phorbol-13-acetate-12-myristate, as determined by surface adherence after 24 hr, was lower in the absence than in the presence of serum. cAMP levels were elevated in response to (-)-isoproterenol. The EC50 was 0.36 +/- 0.01 microM (mean +/- SE, N = 3). The beta-adrenergic ligand 3H-CGP 12177 was specifically bound to 1 single class of binding sites (Kd: 0.15 +/- 0.04 nM, Bmax: 2220 +/- 150, mean +/- SE, N = 3). These data are comparable to our previously reported findings in serum supplemented medium.

Therefore the effects of protease inhibitors on increases in inositol phospholipid metabolism and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were examined. We show that the serine protease inhibitors Tos-Phe-CH2Cl (1-chloro-4-phenyl-3-L-tosylamidobutan-2-one-, TPCK) and Tos-Lys-CH2Cl (7-amino-1-chloro-3-L-tosylamidoheptan-2-one; TLCK) inhibit anti-IgM-mediated accumulation of inositol phosphates in a dose-dependent manner. InsP3 production induced by anti-IgM is also inhibited by pretreatment with Tos-Lys-CH2Cl or Tos-Phe-CH2Cl. Tos-Lys-CH2Cl- Tos-Phe-CH2Cl-mediated inhibition is not overcome by high concentrations of anti-IgM. Moreover, anti-IgM-mediated increases in [Ca2+]i are inhibited by pretreatment of the cells with these inhibitors. However, increases in inositol phospholipid metabolism caused by NaF, an activator of guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins), are approx. 10-fold more resistant to Tos-Lys-CH2Cl and Tos-Phe-CH2Cl inhibition compared with anti-IgM-induced changes. Furthermore, NaF-induced increases in [Ca2+]i are not inhibited by Tos-Lys-CH2Cl or Tos-Phe-CH2Cl pretreatment, suggesting that the inhibitors act at a step proximal to phospholipase C activation. The Tos-Lys-CH2Cl or Tos-Phe-CH2Cl treatment does not change the membrane IgM density as measured by flow cytometry, indicating that the active site of the inhibitors is distal to the membrane IgM molecule. These results indicate that serine proteases may be involved in coupling the receptor cross-linkage to G-protein.","['Mizuguchi, J', 'Utsunomiya, N', 'Nakanishi, M', 'Arata, Y', 'Fukazawa, H']","['Mizuguchi J', 'Utsunomiya N', 'Nakanishi M', 'Arata Y', 'Fukazawa H']","['Department of Applied Immunology, National Institute of Health, Kamiosaki, Shinagawa-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '2104-86-1 (Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin M/*physiology', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Protease Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology', 'Tosyllysine Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1989 Nov 1;263(3):641-6. doi: 10.1042/bj2630641.,0264-6021 (Print) 0264-6021 (Linking),,['10.1042/bj2630641 [doi]'],,PMC1133481,,,,,,,,

We find experimentally that most of the Phe-tRNA present in HIV-1 infected cells lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon loop and most of the Asn-tRNA in HTLV-1 and BLV infected cells lacks the highly modified Q base in its anticodon loop. Interestingly, Phe-tRNA translates a UUU codon within the ribosomal frameshift signal in HIV and Asn-tRNA translates a AAC codon within the proposed frameshift signals in HTLV-1 and BLV. Thus, the lack of a highly modified base in the anticodon loop of tRNAs in retroviral infected cells is correlated with the participation of these undermodified tRNAs in the corresponding frameshift event. This suggests that the ""shifty"" tRNAs proposed by Jacks et al.

The method was successfully used to infect human cells with ecotropic murine retroviruses by means of major histocompatibility complex class I and class II antigens and appears easily adaptable to other cell membrane markers.

A new cell line, MB, with a mature B-cell phenotype recently established in our laboratory, contained light and heavy chain immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and expressed mature Ig RNA. In a cell line with an early lymphoid phenotype, BV173, this analysis showed rearrangement of Ig heavy chain and beta-TCR genes, unrearranged Ig light chain DNA, and expression of only an immature beta-TCR transcript.

The GUD breakpoint maps within the smallest region of overlap (SRO) for the Wilms tumor (WT) gene locus, thus strengthening the previous suggestion of an association between Wilms tumor and other abnormalities of the genitourinary system. The 11p13 translocation breakpoint associated with T-cell acute lymphatic leukemia (T-ALL) is centromeric to the SRO and separated from the WT locus by at least one known gene. This region of the human genome (11p13) is rich in CpG islands that potentially identify genes, some of which may be involved in the various phenotypes associated with the WAGR syndrome.

AIDS and related disorders are etiologically linked to members of the lentivirus subfamily of retroviruses; these lymphocytopathic lentiviruses are designated human immuno-deficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and human immuno-deficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2). The only animals susceptible to experimental HIV-1 infection are the chimpanzee, gibbon ape, and rabbit but AIDS-like disease has not yet been reported in these species. Macaques can be persistently infected with some strains of HIV-2 but no AIDS-like disease has resulted. It is not yet clear how suitable HIV-infected SCID-hu mice will be as a model for AIDS. Several subfamilies of naturally occurring cytopathic retroviruses cause immune suppression, including fatal immunodeficiency syndromes in chickens, mice, cats, and monkeys. Domestic cats suffer immunosuppression from both an onco-virus, feline leukemia virus, and a member of the lentivirus subfamily, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Asian macaques are susceptible to fatal simian AIDS from a type D retrovirus, indigenous in macaques, and from a lentivirus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is indigenous to healthy African monkeys. SIV is the animal lentivirus most closely related to HIV. Of these animal models, the lentivirus infections of cats (FIV) and macaques (SIV) appear to bear the closest similarity in their pathogenesis to HIV infection and AIDS. This review will summarize these various animal model systems for AIDS and illustrate their usefulness for antiviral therapy and vaccinology.","['Gardner, M B', 'Luciw, P A']","['Gardner MB', 'Luciw PA']","['Department of Medical Pathology, University of California, Davis 95616.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,,IM,"['*Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome', 'Animals', 'Birds', 'Cats', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'HIV/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Macaca', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Rabbits', 'Retroviridae', 'Retroviridae Infections', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus', 'Tumor Virus Infections']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 1989 Dec;3(14):2593-606. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.3.14.2556312.,0892-6638 (Print) 0892-6638 (Linking),,['10.1096/fasebj.3.14.2556312 [doi]'],,,,,,,115,,,

In this study, we report that neomycin can also markedly influence agonist binding of G-protein-coupled receptors. In membranes of differentiated human leukemia cells (HL 60 cells), neomycin (0.1-10 mM) was found to induce high-affinity binding of the chemotactic tripeptide, N-formyl-methionylleucylphenylalanine (fMet-Leu-Phe), to its receptor sites in a manner similar to magnesium. Gentamycin and streptomycin, two other aminoglycoside antibiotics, were as potent and as effective as neomycin or magnesium in inducing high-affinity agonist receptor binding. Pretreatment of the cells with pertussis toxin reduced the effects of magnesium and neomycin on agonist receptor binding likewise. In contrast, magnesium but not neomycin largely enhanced the potency of guanine nucleotides, particularly of GTP and its analog, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), to reduce fMet-Leu-Phe receptor binding, while maximal inhibition of agonist receptor binding by guanine nucleotides was identical with magnesium and neomycin. Furthermore, neomycin could not replace magnesium in providing stimulation of HL 60 membrane high-affinity GTPase by fMet-Leu-Phe. In close agreement to these findings on the pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gi-protein-coupled formyl peptide receptors, neomycin in a manner similar to magnesium induced high-affinity agonist binding of Gs-protein-coupled beta-adrenoceptors. Similar to formyl peptide receptor binding, high-affinity binding of isoproterenol to beta-adrenoceptors in guinea pig lung membranes induced by magnesium and neomycin was inhibited by the GTP analog, guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate), to a similar maximal extent but with an about 100-fold higher potency in the presence of magnesium than in the presence of neomycin. The data presented thus indicate that neomycin and other aminoglycoside antibiotics can mimic the action of magnesium (or other divalent cations) in inducing high-affinity agonist binding of Gi- and Gs-protein-coupled receptors, but not in inducing subsequent G-protein activation by guanosine triphosphates. The data, furthermore, suggest that neomycin by this selective action will be a powerful tool to dissect the multiple sites of magnesium's action in the agonist receptor-G-protein interaction.","['Herrmann, E', 'Gierschik, P', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Herrmann E', 'Gierschik P', 'Jakobs KH']","['Pharmacokologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Adrenergic, beta)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'L628TT009W (Isoproterenol)']",IM,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Isoproterenol/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Neomycin/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Adrenergic, beta/metabolism', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1989/11/20 00:00,1989/11/20 00:01,['1989/11/20 00:00'],"['1989/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1989 Nov 20;185(3):677-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15165.x.,0014-2956 (Print) 0014-2956 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1989.tb15165.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Calves were followed from birth to the time they left their individual hutch (TLIH), at about 90 days of age. The probability of being infected at TLIH and the daily risk of infection between birth and TLIH were modelled using the logistic and the Cox models, respectively. Calves with no detectable antibodies during the first week of life were up to 2.00 and 2.75 times more likely to be infected at TLIH compared to calves with low and high concentrations of antibodies during the first week of life, respectively (p = 0.01). When the daily risk was modelled, calves without antibodies at the estimated day of infection were up to 3.4 and 11.6 times more likely to become infected than calves with low and high concentrations of antibodies on that day, respectively (p less than 0.001). Results indicated that calfhood infection may be reduced by about 45% through the feeding of colostrum with BLV antibodies. Further reduction in infection may be possible by feeding calves milk powder, milk replacer, and/or milk from noninfected cows. Results also indicated that quantification of the effect of a time-dependent risk factor, such as colostral antibody concentration, might be affected if treated as a fixed factor.","['Lassauzet, M L', 'Johnson, W O', 'Thurmond, M C', 'Stevens, F']","['Lassauzet ML', 'Johnson WO', 'Thurmond MC', 'Stevens F']","['Department of Medicine, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Tulare 93274.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Canada,Can J Vet Res,Canadian journal of veterinary research = Revue canadienne de recherche veterinaire,8607793,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/*immunology', 'California/epidemiology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/epidemiology/*immunology/prevention & control', 'Colostrum/*immunology', 'Female', 'Housing, Animal', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/immunology/prevention & control/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*immunology', 'Male', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retroviridae/*immunology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Can J Vet Res. 1989 Oct;53(4):424-30.,0830-9000 (Print) 0830-9000 (Linking),,,,PMC1255570,,,,,,,,

Temperature shift experiments demonstrated that both IL-3 abrogation and the regulation of c-myc expression correlated with the presence of functional v-abl. Induction of c-myc expression by reactivation of temperature-sensitive v-abl mimicked c-myc induction by IL-3 in that it did not require protein synthesis and occurred at the level of transcription, with effects on both initiation and a transcription elongation block. However, v-abl-regulated FDC-P1 cell growth differed from IL-3-regulated growth in that c-fos and junB, which are normally induced by IL-3, were not induced by activation of v-abl.","['Cleveland, J L', 'Dean, M', 'Rosenberg, N', 'Wang, J Y', 'Rapp, U R']","['Cleveland JL', 'Dean M', 'Rosenberg N', 'Wang JY', 'Rapp UR']","['Laboratory of Viral Carcinogenesis, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21701.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', '*Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Temperature', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Dec;9(12):5685-95. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.12.5685-5695.1989.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),,['10.1128/mcb.9.12.5685-5695.1989 [doi]'],"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-74102/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC363740,,,,,,,,

The oncogenic potential of the v-fps protein-tyrosine kinase was investigated by introduction of the gag-fps coding sequence of Fujinami sarcoma virus into the mouse germ line. Transgenic mice with v-fps under the transcriptional control of a 5' human beta-globin promoter (GF) or with both 5' and 3' beta-globin regulatory sequences (GEF) were viable. Unexpectedly, both GF and GEF transgenes were expressed in a wide variety of tissues and induced a spectrum of benign and malignant tumors. These tumors, which included lymphomas, thymomas, fibrosarcomas, angiosarcomas, hemangiomas, and neurofibrosarcomas, developed with various frequencies after latent periods of 2 to 12 months. The majority of lymphoid neoplasms appeared to be of T-cell origin and were monoclonal, as judged by rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta or immunoglobulin genes. Some tissues that expressed the v-fps oncogene, such as heart, brain, lung, and testes, developed no malignant tumors. The v-fps protein-tyrosine kinase therefore has a broad but not unrestricted range of oncogenic activity in cells of lymphoid and mesenchymal origin. The incomplete penetrance of the neoplastic phenotype and the monoclonality of lymphoid tumors suggest that tumor formation in v-fps mice requires genetic or epigenetic events in addition to expression of the P130gag-fps protein-tyrosine kinase.","['Yee, S P', 'Mock, D', 'Greer, P', 'Maltby, V', 'Rossant, J', 'Bernstein, A', 'Pawson, T']","['Yee SP', 'Mock D', 'Greer P', 'Maltby V', 'Rossant J', 'Bernstein A', 'Pawson T']","['Division of Molecular and Developmental Biology, Mt.

Genet. 14:427-438, 1988). In such hybrids, N-myc was activated by insertion of endogenous Moloney-like retrovirus sequences into mouse N-myc exon 3 when the hybrids gained macrophage properties. Interestingly, expression of N-myc took place in all aged hybrids. These results suggest that such unique insertional mutagenesis occurs in a regionally specific manner and that expression of N-myc may play a role in hematopoietic lineage conversion.","['Setoguchi, M', 'Higuchi, Y', 'Yoshida, S', 'Nasu, N', 'Miyazaki, Y', 'Akizuki, S', 'Yamamoto, S']","['Setoguchi M', 'Higuchi Y', 'Yoshida S', 'Nasu N', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Akizuki S', 'Yamamoto S']","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Oita, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Transposable Elements/*genetics', 'Genomic Library', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Macrophages/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma', '*Oncogenes', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Oct;9(10):4515-22. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.10.4515-4522.1989.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),,['10.1128/mcb.9.10.4515-4522.1989 [doi]'],,PMC362536,,,"['GENBANK/M29208', 'GENBANK/M29209', 'GENBANK/M29210', 'GENBANK/M29211']",,,,,

In this report, we provide evidence for a second tax1-responsive sequence in the viral long terminal repeat. Analysis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I promoter deletion mutants and plasmids containing cloned oligonucleotide motifs demonstrated that this 47-bp sequence, located between -117 and -163, confers responsiveness to tax1. We further demonstrated that proteins present in HeLa nuclear extracts bind specifically to this tax1-responsive sequence. Mutants that affected in vivo activity also decreased in vitro binding. Using an in vitro binding assay, we demonstrated that tax1 interacts indirectly with the 47-bp sequence, most likely through protein-protein interaction. Thus, while tax1 does not bind directly to DNA to enhance transcription, it may influence sequence-specific responses by interacting with the primary DNA-protein complex.","['Marriott, S J', 'Boros, I', 'Duvall, J F', 'Brady, J N']","['Marriott SJ', 'Boros I', 'Duvall JF', 'Brady JN']","['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Ribosomal', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tat/*metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1989 Oct;9(10):4152-60. doi: 10.1128/mcb.9.10.4152-4160.1989.,0270-7306 (Print) 0270-7306 (Linking),,['10.1128/mcb.9.10.4152-4160.1989 [doi]'],,PMC362493,,,,,,,,

We previously cloned part of an endogenous MuLV associated with the resistance allele of the Fv-4 gene (Fv-4r). In this report, we describe an extended clone of the Fv-4r allele consisting of a 17-kilobase DNA fragment containing the retroviral sequence and its 5'-flanking sequence. The new DNA clone contains a truncated MuLV with delta pol-env-long terminal repeat sequences but no other MuLV-reactive sequence within 13 kilobases upstream of the truncated MuLV. Transfection of this clone into mouse cells led to transcription of Fv-4 env mRNA, expression of the Fv-4r-specific MuLV envelope protein, and resistance to infection with ecotropic MuLV but not amphotropic and dualtropic MuLVs. Restriction of ecotropic viruses appears to occur at or before viral cDNA synthesis. This result is consistent with a model of receptor interference for Fv-4 restriction. Our data also suggest that the 5' non-MuLV sequence is important for biological function, since a DNA clone which lacks most of the 5'-flanking sequence did not efficiently confer the resistance phenotype.","['Ikeda, H', 'Sugimura, H']","['Ikeda H', 'Sugimura H']","['Laboratory of Experimental Pathology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics/isolation & purification', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Genes, Viral', 'Immunity, Innate/*genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Dec;63(12):5405-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.12.5405-5412.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.12.5405-5412.1989 [doi]'],,PMC251208,,,,,,,,

To test whether transient-expression ratios are representative of those of integrated proviruses, we developed a system for generation of retroviral transmission vectors differing only in U3. Vectors with the long terminal repeats of leukemogenic SL3-3 and nonleukemogenic Akv viruses were used for infection of a lymphoid cell line. We then compared expression in infected cells with transient expression after DNA transfection. In contrast to a high SL3-3/Akv reporter gene expression ratio in the transient assays, the ratio in stably infected populations was low. Sets of random cell clones from the two infected populations showed wide variation, with a mean value ratio identical to the population ratio but a considerably higher ratio between lowest values. We suggest that the lower expression levels, like transient expression, reflect inherent enhancer strength and that the higher levels represent chromosomal influence. The different pathogenicity, despite the moderate difference in average expression, may then relate to a different capacity for insertional oncogene activation owing to the different inherent enhancer strengths revealed by the transient-expression assays and the least active proviruses.","['Paludan, K', 'Dai, H Y', 'Duch, M', 'Jorgensen, P', 'Kjeldgaard, N O', 'Pedersen, F S']","['Paludan K', 'Dai HY', 'Duch M', 'Jorgensen P', 'Kjeldgaard NO', 'Pedersen FS']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Plant Physiology, University of Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Expression', '*Genes, Viral', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Kanamycin Kinase', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Phosphotransferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Plasmids', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transfection']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1989 Dec;63(12):5201-7. doi: 10.1128/JVI.63.12.5201-5207.1989.,0022-538X (Print) 0022-538X (Linking),,['10.1128/JVI.63.12.5201-5207.1989 [doi]'],,PMC251184,,,,,,,,

The primary target for transformation in vitro is chicken macrophages; infection of chicken fibroblasts does not lead to complete morphological transformation. FH3 also exhibits a limited host range, in that Japanese quail macrophages and fibroblasts are infected but are not completely transformed. FH3 induces in vivo a limited tumor type if injected into 10-day-old chick embryos; only a cranial myelocytoma, which does not appear to be metastatic, can be detected. The v-myc gene of FH3 is expressed predominantly as a P145 Gag-Myc protein which is encoded by a ca. 8-kilobase genomic RNA.

We examined the cis-acting sequences in the simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer required for its activation by HTLV-I p40tax. Experiments with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs bearing the SV40 enhancer elements revealed that p40tax-dependent transactivation of the SV40 enhancer is mediated through the C element that contains the typical sequence for binding of a nuclear factor NF-kappa B. Activation of the C element by p40tax was seen in a limited set of cell lines as was also seen with the whole enhancer of SV40. Binding of NF-kappa B or NF-kappa B-like factor to the SV40 C element increased when p40tax was expressed.

Our results define one population of B lymphocytes, represented by prolymphocytic leukaemic (PLL) cells, which are highly susceptible to immortalization by EBV. Another B-cell type, represented by chronic lymphocytic leukaemic (CLL) cells, can be readily infected by the virus but is resistant to immortalization. Comparative studies of viral and cellular related events early after infection in these 2 cell types reveal that both express the EB viral nuclear antigen (EBNA) complex, but the immortalization-resistant CLL cells fail to express the latent membrane protein (LMP), which can be detected in PLL cells 48 hr after infection. Circularization of the linear viral genome could be detected at 7 days post infection in the PLL cells, but only in 2 out of 4 CLL cells tested. Both CLL and PLL cells show increased surface expression of CD23 and HLA-DR molecules after infection but, whereas PLL cells show an increase in size, together with RNA and DNA synthesis indicative of cell cycle progression, CLL cells appear to be arrested in the G1/S phase of the cycle. The results suggest that the outcome of infection by EBV is determined by the nature of the target cell rather than by random virus-related events. The correlation between the block in immortalization of CLL cells and their failure to express LMP suggests that expression of this protein is essential for in vitro immortalization of B cells. The failure to detect circularization in some EBV-infected CLL cells suggests that this, as well as LMP expression, may be dependent on prior activation of the B cell by EBV, an event which may vary between the different CLL samples tested.","['Walls, E V', 'Doyle, M G', 'Patel, K K', 'Allday, M J', 'Catovsky, D', 'Crawford, D H']","['Walls EV', 'Doyle MG', 'Patel KK', 'Allday MJ', 'Catovsky D', 'Crawford DH']","['Division of Biological Sciences, Hatfield Polytechnic, Herts, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Complement 3d)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte', 'Antigens, Viral', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/genetics', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*physiopathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/analysis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Complement/analysis', 'Receptors, Complement 3d', 'Receptors, Fc/analysis', 'Receptors, IgE']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1989 Nov 15;44(5):846-53. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910440517.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),,['10.1002/ijc.2910440517 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Forskolin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) were used to increase intracellular cAMP concentrations. Treatment of Jurkat cells with forskolin or db-cAMP for 3 h inhibited the subsequent rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration induced by an optimally mitogenic dose of 100 ng/ml of the anti-CD3 OKT3, whereas PGE2 counteracted the Ca2+ rise only marginally. The inhibitory effect of forskolin and PGE2 on the Ca2+ signal correlated with their abilities to induce increased cAMP levels in Jurkat cells. The suppression of the Ca2+ response was dependent on the concentration of the cAMP-elevating agent and the time of pre-incubation with the drug. The cAMP-mediated inhibition of the Ca2+ response diminished or disappeared when increasing concentrations of OKT3 were used to stimulate the rise in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. The results indicate that cAMP participates in the regulation of T lymphocyte activation at the level of signal transduction. Our findings, which stress the crucial role of the concentration of the ligand used to trigger Ca2+ responses, provide an explanation to previous contradictory reports on the impact of cAMP on the signal transduction in T cells.","['Papadogiannakis, N', 'Nordstrom, T E', 'Andersson, L C', 'Wolff, C H']","['Papadogiannakis N', 'Nordstrom TE', 'Andersson LC', 'Wolff CH']","['Department of Pathology, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*physiology', 'CD3 Complex', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cytoplasm/analysis', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1989 Oct;19(10):1953-6. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830191029.,0014-2980 (Print) 0014-2980 (Linking),,['10.1002/eji.1830191029 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a DEAE column revealed a single, homogeneous species of membrane-associated PTPase with an apparent molecular mass of 43 kDa as determined by HPLC on a gel permeation column in the presence of Triton X-100. Comparison of this PTPase with the membrane-associated PTPase activities present in rat spleen and in the human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 revealed additional species resolvable by DEAE-HPLC.

DNA strand breaks produced by this intercalating agent were essentially DNA lesions mediated by topoisomerase II, even at very high drug concentrations, since they were detected as protein-associated breaks by filter elution. Similarly, the appearance of delayed DNA breaks in cells exposed to high concentrations, following drug removal, showed predominance of protein-associated breaks, thus supporting a similar mechanism of breakage induction. This finding indirectly suggests that, in this experimental model, free radical production makes little (if any) contribution to DNA damage, and also that DNA effects are not the consequence of early cell death. In contrast to a rapid disappearance of protein-associated strand breaks produced by intercalating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors of different classes, DNA breaks induced by low concentrations of the anthracycline derivative are only partially reversible following drug removal, but they persisted and even increased with high concentrations. Thus, not only the extent of DNA breaks but also their persistence may contribute to the cytotoxic potency of anthracyclines. The importance of DNA lesions to cytotoxic action of the anthracycline is also emphasized by drug effect on the resistant line. A negligible effect on DNA of resistant cells was detected at drug concentrations lethal to sensitive cells. However, exposure to equitoxic drug concentrations resulted in a comparable amount of DNA breaks in sensitive and resistant cells. Although faster DNA rejoining in resistant cells may be in part attributable to increased efflux of drug, no correlation exists between cell drug accumulation and extent of DNA lesions. With equitoxic drug concentrations cellular drug content was higher in resistant cells, suggesting an intrinsic insensitivity of this variant to DNA cleavage effects of the anthracycline.","['Capranico, G', 'Tinelli, S', 'Zunino, F']","['Capranico G', 'Tinelli S', 'Zunino F']","['Division of Experimental Oncology B, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA/*drug effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Idarubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1989;72(1-2):113-23. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(89)90022-7.,0009-2797 (Print) 0009-2797 (Linking),,"['0009-2797(89)90022-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(89)90022-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Identical T-cell receptor beta and gamma chain gene rearrangements were found for the CCRF-CEM line in vitro and the xenografted cells in vivo, demonstrating that only one clone was present and that differences in immunophenotyping were not the result of clonal selection.

The molecular basis of the reduced topoisomerase II levels in these resistant cells has been investigated. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA from drug-sensitive and -resistant cells using a 1.8-kilobase human topoisomerase II complementary DNA revealed the presence of two mRNA species: a 6.6-kilobase transcript that was strongly expressed in drug-sensitive cells but reduced 7- to 8-fold in resistant cells; and a 5.5-kilobase transcript detected only in drug-resistant cells. Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA digested with BamHI, StuI, or PvuII and probed with the 1.8-kilobase complementary DNA for human topoisomerase II showed that, in Adriamycin-resistant cells, there were two different alleles for topoisomerase II, one identical to the native allele but with a lower gene copy number than that found in sensitive cells, and a second allele containing a mutation present only in resistant cells. These findings suggest that the reduced levels of topo II protein in drug-resistant cells may be due to reduced amounts of the native 6.6-kilobase mRNA. The unique 5.5-kilobase mRNA in resistant cells may represent a shortened transcript of the mutated topoisomerase II allele.","['Deffie, A M', 'Bosman, D J', 'Goldenberg, G J']","['Deffie AM', 'Bosman DJ', 'Goldenberg GJ']","['Manitoba Institute of Cell Biology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['*Alleles', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/enzymology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/12/15 00:00,1989/12/15 00:01,['1989/12/15 00:00'],"['1989/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 15;49(24 Pt 1):6879-82.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,['Cancer Res 1990 Jan 15;50(2):449'],,,,,,,

Both time intervals and dose relationships were examined. DSF showed a substantial potentiation of HN2 cytotoxicity against murine AKR leukemia cell spleen colony-forming units (LCFU) when given i.p. between 15 to 30 min prior to HN2 i.v. treatment. For 3 mg DSF/mouse pretreatment, leukemia LCFU survival was about 10(-6) whereas it was about 10(-2) for HN2 alone. The extent of this potentiation decreased as the time between treatments increased. Significant potentiation was noted even when a low dose of DSF (0.25 mg/mouse) was administered 15 min before HN2. However, DSF had little if any effect on the modulation of HN2 cytotoxicity to normal hematopoietic cell spleen colony-forming units (NCFU). DDC showed an increasing potentiation of HN2 cytotoxicity against LCFU when given i.p. prior to HN2 i.v. treatment. The maximum effect was noted between 2 and 4 h with a surviving fraction for LCFU between 10(-5) and 10(-6) for 20 mg/mouse DDC pretreatment. The extent of this effect then decreased as the time interval increased beyond 4 h, but it was still significant for the 24-h interval. This pronounced potentiation effect was dose dependent for DDC. The compound exhibited a protective effect against HN2 cytotoxicity to NCFU when given 15 min before HN2. This protection decreased with increased time interval.

Optimal drug scheduling for DDTC and cis-diammine(cyclobutanedicarboxylato)platinum(II) (CBDCA) has been determined in C57BL/6 x DBA/2 F1 mice, using the pluripotent stem cell assay to assess hematological toxicity. DDTC, at doses of 0.3 to 300 mg/kg given 3 h after 60 mg/kg CBDCA, tripled the number of proliferating spleen colony-forming units compared to treatment with CBDCA alone. No significant difference in efficacy was noted among these doses. DDTC, at the lowest myeloprotective dose (0.3 mg/kg), was most active when administered from 1 to 3 h after CBDCA. The combination of DDTC with CBDCA in vivo did not alter the clonogenic survival of L1210 cells compared to CBDCA alone. CBDCA depressed both bone marrow and tumor cell DNA synthesis. DDTC given 3 h after CBDCA hastened the recovery of DNA synthesis only in marrow cells; the addition of DDTC to CBDCA did not alter DNA synthesis in tumor cells. DDTC alone did not significantly affect DNA synthesis in either normal or tumor cells. These results suggest that the mechanism of DDTC myeloprotection involves stimulation of bone marrow cell proliferation and that the selectivity of DDTC is based upon the absence of stimulation in tumor cells.","['Schmalbach, T K', 'Borch, R F']","['Schmalbach TK', 'Borch RF']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '99Z2744345 (Ditiocarb)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Carboplatin', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Ditiocarb/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*toxicity']",1989/12/01 00:00,1989/12/01 00:01,['1989/12/01 00:00'],"['1989/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1989 Dec 1;49(23):6629-33.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,"['CA 11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34620/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

TCR delta gene rearrangements or deletions were observed in all 50 T-cell neoplasms: 5 of 8 CD3- T-cell neoplasms showed rearrangements, whereas biallelic deletion of TCR delta gene was the most common pattern in CD3+ T-cell neoplasm (39 of 42 patients). Rearrangements of TCR delta gene were also detected in 23 of 40 immature B-cell leukemias, including 22 of 25 patients with rearrangements of TCR gamma gene, 2 of 17 mature B-cell neoplasms, and 3 of 30 myeloid leukemias. Thus, TCR delta gene rearrangement or deletion is always found in T-cell neoplasms and is frequently found in immature B-cell leukemias associated with TCR gamma gene rearrangement. Furthermore, TCR delta gene rearrangements associated with the germline configuration of the TCR beta, gamma, and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes were observed in two immature T-cell leukemias, suggesting that TCR delta gene rearrangements precede TCR gamma and beta gene rearrangements.

Depending on the chemical modification of the vitamin D parent compounds, they could be separated into active and inactive analogs. Cholecalciferol and ergocalciferol were similarly active, but epimerization of ergocalciferol at carbon 23 caused loss of activity. Hexafluorination at carbon 26 and 27 and the introduction of a double bond at carbon 22 or 23 had no or little effect on the activity. The loss of activity was caused by the introduction of a triple bond at carbon 23 and by hydroxylation at carbon 23, 26 or 28. The differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) induced by these derivatives was used as a parameter for antitumour activity. All six analogs, which markedly affected calcium metabolism, were highly active in HL-60 cells. However, at least three derivatives were highly active in the antitumour test but failed to induce hypercalcemia. Thus, these results indicate that it could be possible to develop medically useful vitamin D derivatives devoid of hypercalcemic side-effects.","['Kistler, A', 'Galli, B', 'Horst, R', 'Truitt, G A', 'Uskokovic, M R']","['Kistler A', 'Galli B', 'Horst R', 'Truitt GA', 'Uskokovic MR']","['Pharmaceutical Research, F.

The conjugates and parent beta-lactam antibiotics showed similar antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The affinity of each conjugate for the chemotactic peptide receptor was determined in a competitive binding assay, using 3H-labeled N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine. All conjugates bound to the receptor, but with affinities ranging from 1/3 to 1/100 that of the tritiated substrate. There was good correlation between receptor affinity and stimulation of chemotaxis.

Similar oligosaccharide substituents were found on cell-associated and extracellular forms of gp65. Enzymatic deglycosylation experiments demonstrated that in addition to the predicted four N-linked oligosaccharides, gp65 contains O-linked carbohydrates which are resistant to the action of peptide N-Glycanase F, but sensitive to neuraminidase and O-Glycanase. These structures may be related to O-linked oligosaccharides previously found on the env gene products of murine leukemia viruses. Comparison of the sizes of the deglycosylated forms of cell-associated and supernatant gp65 demonstrated that the extracellular molecules are approximately 3 kDa smaller than the cell-associated components. These data suggest the involvement of proteolysis at a C-terminal site in the release of gp65 from the plasma membrane.","['Pinter, A', 'Honnen, W J']","['Pinter A', 'Honnen WJ']","['Laboratory of Retroviral Biology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Glycoside Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Fibroblasts', 'Gene Products, env/analysis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, env', 'Glycoside Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Oligosaccharides/analysis', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/*genetics/metabolism/ultrastructure']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1989 Nov;173(1):136-43. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90229-8.,0042-6822 (Print) 0042-6822 (Linking),,['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90229-8 [doi]'],['CA 42129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of FIV was 19 per cent in sick cats and 6 per cent in healthy cats, and the prevalence of FeLV was 18 per cent in sick cats and 5 per cent in healthy cats; both infections were more common in domestic cats than in pedigree cats. Feline immunodeficiency virus was more prevalent in older cats but FeLV was more prevalent in younger cats. There was no difference between the prevalence of FeLV in male and female cats but male cats were more likely to be infected with FIV than female cats. No interaction was demonstrated between FIV and FeLV infections. Of the cats which were in contact with FIV in households with more than one cat, 21 per cent had seroconverted. The prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats in contact with FeLV was 14 per cent. The clinical signs associated with FIV were pyrexia, gingivitis/stomatitis and respiratory signs, and with FeLV, pyrexia and anaemia. It was concluded that both viruses were significant causes of disease, and that the cats most likely to be infected with FIV were older, free-roaming male cats and for FeLV, younger, free-roaming cats.","['Hosie, M J', 'Robertson, C', 'Jarrett, O']","['Hosie MJ', 'Robertson C', 'Jarrett O']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Vet Rec,The Veterinary record,0031164,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/analysis', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Health Status', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Retroviridae Infections/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Sex Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1989/09/09 00:00,1989/09/09 00:01,['1989/09/09 00:00'],"['1989/09/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/09 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vet Rec. 1989 Sep 9;125(11):293-7. doi: 10.1136/vr.125.11.293.,0042-4900 (Print) 0042-4900 (Linking),,['10.1136/vr.125.11.293 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Cells from both the wild-type (wt), RA-responsive HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line and a selected greater than or equal to 300-fold RA-resistant subline expressed approximately equal amounts of two RAR-alpha transcripts, 4.0 and 3.1 kb in size.

The relative expression in six cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; two RA-responsive; one, previously treated with 13-cis-RA in vivo, equivocally RA-responsive) and one case of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) with promyelocytosis (RA unresponsive) was 0.91 +/- 0.14 versus 0.53 +/- 0.14 for eight cases of nonpromyelocytic AML (p congruent to 0.001).

Physical examination revealed generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly. White blood cell count was 32,800 microliters with 74.4% blast cells. Bone marrow was hypercellular with 93.6% blast cells. Blast cells were weakly positive for acid phosphatase and PAS stainings but were negative for peroxidase, sudan black B and esterase stainings. Cell surface marker analysis of blast cells disclosed that they were positive for anti-HLA-DR, CD19, CD24, CD33 and CD38, but were negative for CD10 and CD20. Cytoplasmic immunoglobulin of blast cells was negative and TdT activity by immunofluorescent method was positive. Chromosomal analysis of bone marrow samples revealed normal karyotype. Therefore, this case was diagnosed as having acute lymphoblastic leukemia (L2) and achieved complete remission with LVP therapy consisting of 1-asparaginase, vincristine and prednisolone. Gene analysis of blast cells disclosed germ-line configuration of both the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and T cell receptor beta chain gene.

Because the development of resistance to cancer chemotherapeutic agents represents a major limitation of cancer chemotherapy, we investigated the mechanism of resistance by murine P388 leukemia to camptothecin (topoisomerase I inhibitor) or amsacrine (topoisomerase II inhibitor). The resistant cells contained reduced levels of topoisomerase activity and messenger RNA. The topoisomerase gene of these cells was rearranged (only in one allele) and hypermethylated. These topoisomerase gene alterations probably resulted in reduced transcription and, thus, enzyme production, which was correlated with resistance to the topoisomerase inhibitor.","['Tan, K B', 'Mattern, M R', 'Eng, W K', 'McCabe, F L', 'Johnson, R K']","['Tan KB', 'Mattern MR', 'Eng WK', 'McCabe FL', 'Johnson RK']","['Department of Cell Sciences, Smith Kline and French Laboratories, King of Prussia, PA 19406.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 5.99.1.2 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type I)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Amsacrine/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Camptothecin/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type I/analysis/*genetics', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/analysis/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Methylation', 'Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1989 Nov 15;81(22):1732-5. doi: 10.1093/jnci/81.22.1732.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),,['10.1093/jnci/81.22.1732 [doi]'],['CA-40884/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

It shows that perfectly matched repeated oligomers up to 13 nucleotides long are overrepresented and scattered throughout both ST-FeLV GAG and Mo-MuLV GAG, in noncoding and coding sectors, with no stringent correlation to codon usage in ST-FeLV gPr80gag. Many repeated oligomers share a core consensus that is intriguingly part of the inverted repeat at the termini of the long terminal repeat. Local scrambled repetitions of nucleotide subsequences have been found; they suggest a model of molecular evolution by slippage-like mechanisms. Thus, viral genomes could be subject to the same evolutionary mechanisms that are now known to be operating extensively in eukaryotic genomes.

Since this result contrasts with a higher incidence reported with IFN-alpha 2a, the question has been raised whether differences in assay techniques and patient comparability rather than inherent differences in the molecules might account for the reported differences in antibody incidence. In this report two patient groups, 151 hairy cell leukemia (HCL) patients and 101 patients with other malignancies, who have received long-term dosing with IFN-alpha 2b, are reported. The sera of both groups were studied before, during and after treatment by various assay methodologies. Utilizing three assay techniques, a less than 3% overall incidence of serum antibody formation was confirmed in these retested samples. With over 575 samples tested in multiple assays, the radioimmunoassay, as utilized in prior reports, demonstrated 99% agreement with a bioassay. Therefore, prior speculation that the assay technique for IFN-alpha 2b might produce a high false-negative rate was disproven. Additionally, the clinical outcome of these patients also failed to demonstrate a pattern of clinical relapse. In summary, these new analyses confirm the low (less than 3%) incidence of neutralizing antibody development following treatment with IFN-alpha 2b and confirm that no high rates of clinical relapse have developed in patients treated with chronic long-term dosing. Assay methodology does not appear to be a likely explanation for the low incidence of antibody formation reported with IFN-alpha 2. Rather, the unique molecular structure and pharmaceutical formulation of IFN-alpha 2b remains the most likely explanation of its minimal antigenicity.","['Spiegel, R J', 'Jacobs, S L', 'Treuhaft, M W']","['Spiegel RJ', 'Jacobs SL', 'Treuhaft MW']","['Schering-Plough Corporation, Kenilworth, NJ 07033.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Interferon Res,Journal of interferon research,8100396,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*analysis/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', '*Biological Assay', 'Encephalomyocarditis virus/metabolism', '*Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/*immunology', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/blood/*immunology/therapy', 'Neoplasms/blood/*immunology/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', '*Radioimmunoassay', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1989/09/01 00:00,1989/09/01 00:01,['1989/09/01 00:00'],"['1989/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Res. 1989 Sep;9 Suppl 1:S17-24.,0197-8357 (Print) 0197-8357 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

This enzyme is induced in some tumor cells after treatment with IFN-gamma. The mechanism of induction of IDO in tumor cells by IFN-gamma was studied in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Before the addition of IFN-gamma, no IDO could be detected in these cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells with IFN-gamma produced an induction of IDO, with peak activity occurring 72 to 96 h after addition of IFN-gamma. Because phorbol esters are known to induce many enzymes in cells, most likely through the activation of protein kinase C, the effects of PMA on the induction of IDO were determined. PMA potentiated the IFN-gamma-induced elevation of IDO, but by itself, was unable to induce enzyme activity. Maximum induction of IDO in the presence of PMA and IFN-gamma was obtained by preexposure of the cells to PMA for 48 h before the addition of IFN-gamma. Maximum induction of IDO after the addition of IFN-gamma occurred 24 to 48 h after addition of the cytokine to the culture medium. However, the induction of IDO does not appear to be potentiated through the activation of protein kinase C, because the addition of the protein kinase C inhibitor H-7 had no effect on the induction of IDO when the cells were exposed to PMA and IFN-gamma. Moreover, diacylglycerol was unable to replace PMA in these studies. Studies with cAMP and cGMP analogs suggest a role for these compounds in the regulation of IDO expression.","['Edelstein, M P', 'Ozaki, Y', 'Duch, D S']","['Edelstein MP', 'Ozaki Y', 'Duch DS']","['Department of Medicinal Biochemistry, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.13.11.11 (Tryptophan Oxygenase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H2D2X058MU (Cyclic GMP)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic GMP/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tryptophan Oxygenase/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1989 Nov 1;143(9):2969-73.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

To locate this proteinase in human neutrophils we reacted the cells for peroxidase and then applied monospecific polyclonal antibodies to human neutrophil gelatinase to immunolabel ultrathin frozen sections using an immunogold technique. Gelatinase was localized in a population of peroxidase-negative granules. Double-labeling experiments using antibodies against lactoferrin, a marker for specific granules, and gelatinase demonstrated colocalization of the two antigens in 80% of the specific granules. However, some granules immunostained with only the lactoferrin or gelatinase antibody. Similar techniques were used to examine precursor cells from bone marrow. In myelocytes both gelatinase and lactoferrin were present in large developing specific granules; however, some mature specific granules contained only lactoferrin. Thus, it is possible that lactoferrin synthesis begins earlier than gelatinase synthesis and that overlapping synthesis and segregation occurs during the myelocyte stage. These findings suggest that the main storage compartment of gelatinase is within the peroxidase-negative specific granules.","['Hibbs, M S', 'Bainton, D F']","['Hibbs MS', 'Bainton DF']","['Division of Rheumatic Diseases, University of Connecticut Health Center, Newington 06111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)', 'EC 3.4.23.1 (Pepsin A)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Gelatinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*enzymology', 'Gelatinases', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Lactoferrin/blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Weight', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Pepsin A/*blood', 'Peroxidase/blood', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1989/11/01 00:00,1989/11/01 00:01,['1989/11/01 00:00'],"['1989/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1989 Nov;84(5):1395-402. doi: 10.1172/JCI114312.,0021-9738 (Print) 0021-9738 (Linking),,['10.1172/JCI114312 [doi]'],"['AR-01138/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-10486/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC304001,,,,,,,,

Approximately 0.5 mg of enzyme, free of detectable contaminants, was obtained from 40 g of cells using seven conventional purification steps. The mouse enzyme contains subunits of 180, 70, 56, and 47 kDa, almost completely intact and similar to the subunit sizes reported for DNA polymerase alpha/primase from Drosophila embryos (Kaguni, L. S., Rossignol, J-M., Conaway, R. C., and Lehman, I. R. (1983) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A similar structure has also been inferred for mammalian DNA polymerase alpha/primase; however, previous descriptions of the highly purified mammalian enzyme complex have included substantial evidence of proteolysis and/or partial loss of subunits. In particular, the intact 180-kDa subunit has ordinarily been a minor component, and the molecular mass of the complex and total number of subunits have not been established. Results reported here indicate that the native DNA polymerase alpha/primase consists of one each of the four subunit sizes for a total of 353 kDa, based on estimates from denaturing gels, or 344 kDa when sizes deduced from available nucleic acid sequence data are substituted for three of the four subunits. A figure of 313 kDa was calculated from the sedimentation coefficient (8.9 S) and Stokes radius (81.1 A), the values for which also indicate a frictional ratio of 1.80, corresponding to an axial ratio of approximately 16 and suggesting a highly extended structure.","['Goulian, M', 'Heard, C J']","['Goulian M', 'Heard CJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0613.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hydroxyapatites)', '91D9GV0Z28 (Durapatite)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Primase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Chromatography', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, Ion Exchange', 'DNA Polymerase II/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'DNA Primase', 'Durapatite', 'Hydroxyapatites', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'RNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1989 Nov 15;264(32):19407-15.,0021-9258 (Print) 0021-9258 (Linking),,['S0021-9258(19)47316-X [pii]'],['CA11705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,

Identification of an H2 receptor-dependent Ca2+ mobilization pathway in human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells.,18356-62,"In order to analyze the complex activities of histamine H2 receptor activation on neutrophils, human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells were differentiated into neutrophils by incubation with dimethyl sufoxide, loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive indicator dyes, indo-1 or fura-2, and the levels of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) measured in a fluorescent-activated cell sorter and fluorimeter, respectively. Histamine increased [Ca2+]i in a dose-dependent manner with a half-maximal concentration (EC50) of approximately 10(-6) to 10(-5) M, which exhibited H2 receptor specificity. Prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol also induced [Ca2+]i mobilization in HL-60 cells, whereas the cell permeable form of cAMP and forskolin failed to increase [Ca2+]i. Since H2-receptor mediated [Ca2+]i mobilization was not inhibited by reducing the concentration of extracellular Ca2+ nor by the addition of Ca2+ channel antagonists, LaCl3 and nifedipine, [Ca2+]i mobilization is due to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores.

However, histamine-induced mobilization of [Ca2+]i was inhibited by cholera toxin but not by pertussis toxin, whereas the action of fMet-Leu-Phe was inhibited by pertussis toxin but not by cholera toxin.

Incubation of mouse hepatoma (Hepa) cells with heme-HPX causes a rapid dose- and time-dependent increase in the steady-state level of heme oxygenase (HO) mRNA. A maximum induction of 20-25-fold is achieved within 3 h after incubation with 10 microM heme-HPX. This accumulation of HO mRNA results primarily from increased transcription of the HO gene as judged by in vitro nuclear run-on assays. In addition, receptor-mediated transport of heme into Hepa cells significantly decreases the steady-state level of transferrin receptor (TfR) mRNA. While a 25-30-fold decrease in the amount of TfR mRNA is observed within 3 h of incubation of Hepa cells with 10 microM heme-HPX, no significant change in the rate of TfR gene transcription was detected. These regulatory effects of heme-HPX are not restricted to hepatic cells but are also observed in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells.

2553597,NLM,MEDLINE,19891212,20131121,,96,1989,Acutely transforming retroviruses as carcinogens in mouse embryos.,131-51,"Spontaneous and induced transmission of oncogenic retroviruses from parents to offspring is well documented in mammals, as exemplified by murine leukaemia viruses. In addition, it is now common knowledge that transgenic mice, carrying viral and cellular transforming genes, can show unusual tumour incidences and can transmit this character to successive generations. The present report deals with the occurrence of tumours in rodents exposed directly in utero to murine sarcoma viruses (MSV). Attention was focused on whether MSV are involved in the etiopathogenetic processes leading to early-life and adult-type neoplasms in mice. According to our data, this is a likely possibility, since, for example, Kirsten MSV (Ki-MSV) induced stage-specific tumours in CD-1 mice, including lung tumours and skin papillomas, following intraembryonal injections on gestation days 8 and 10, respectively. When the injections were given in the second half of pregnancy, however, only capillary angiomas and other vascular malformations of the brain, as well as mesenchymal sarcomas, were induced in the newborn. Harvey MSV (Ha-MSV), a close relative of Ki-MSV, and Moloney MSV (Mo-MSV) were much less dependent on the stage of embryogenesis, and mesenchymal sarcomas were frequently detected in prenatally infected animals. Other MSV viruses, including 3611, J-2 and 4070A, were active carcinogens in a way totally independent of the embryonal stage exposed, and tumours in the progeny ranged from mesenchymal sarcomas to lymphoblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, respectively. We next looked at the possibility that spontaneous tumours of CD-1 mice might result from the interaction of certain chemical carcinogens with developmentally expressed components of the Ki-MSV virus. The experiments conducted thus far have provided dubious results. An example is given by experiments with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). This compound is a powerful transplacental carcinogen in CD-1 mice, where it induces lung tumours. It was expected that by exposing developing mice to Ki-MSV on day 8 of embryogenesis and to ENU late in pregnancy or in newborns, a great increase in the incidence of lung tumours would have appeared in the offspring. However, this did not happen, and the agents behaved as if different cellular targets were involved. Understanding this difference could be very informative and useful in identifying neoplastic factors in mammalian embryos.","['Rossi, L', 'Capurro, G', 'Muratore, O', 'Campanile, G', 'Cipolla, M', 'Varnier, O E']","['Rossi L', 'Capurro G', 'Muratore O', 'Campanile G', 'Cipolla M', 'Varnier OE']","['Laboratory of in vivo Carcinogenesis, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,IARC Sci Publ,IARC scientific publications,8009542,['P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Embryo, Mammalian/pathology', 'Ethylnitrosourea/toxicity', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/*physiology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,IARC Sci Publ. 1989;(96):131-51.,0300-5038 (Print) 0300-5038 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

PMA was used as a cell modulating agent in order to avoid effects of binding of the exogenous vitamin D metabolites receptors within the cell, which would interfere with subsequent measurement of these receptors in studies of the vitamin D3 metabolic pathway. Both the active 1,25 DHCC form of vitamin D3 and the inactive 24,25 DHCC metabolite inhibit cell proliferation and induce 24-hydroxylase activity, but not 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity. These effects are dose-dependent and maximum enzyme activity is seen in the adherent cell population, which is induced by these compounds. PMA inhibits proliferation of U937 and increases receptors for 1,25 DHCC in these cells (like the vitamin D metabolites). However, unlike the vitamin D metabolites, PMA induces 1 alpha-hydroxylase activity rather than 24-hydroxylase activity. Thus, while PMA and 1,25 DHCC have some similar effects on monocyte precursor cell line differentiation, there is a difference between the effects of the two agents on the vitamin D metabolic pathway. The former promotes synthesis of the active metabolite, and the latter induces an enzyme which renders the metabolite inactive. If these results are considered together, they are consistent with the hypothesis that 1,25 DHCC has an autocrine role within the mononuclear phagocyte system.","['Hewison, M', 'Barker, S', 'Brennan, A', 'Nathan, J', 'Katz, D R', ""O'Riordan, J L""]","['Hewison M', 'Barker S', 'Brennan A', 'Nathan J', 'Katz DR', ""O'Riordan JL""]","['Department of Medicine, Bland-Sutton Institute, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'EC 1.- (Mixed Function Oxygenases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism', 'Mixed Function Oxygenases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol', 'Receptors, Steroid/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1989 Oct;68(2):247-52.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,,,PMC1385425,,,,,,,,

The affinity constant of the receptor for transcobalamin II-cobalamin was found to be 6.1 liter/nmol and the maximal rate of uptake 12 pmol/10(9) cells/h. This uptake is mediated by about 3000 receptor sites per cell. Evidence is presented that the receptor recirculates from the cell surface to the lysosomes and vice versa. Upon differentiation induction of the cells by either DMSO in granulocytic direction or by 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 in monocytic direction a rapid decline in cellular uptake and cell surface binding of the protein-bound vitamin ensues. In particular the internalization of the complex decreases faster than all other observed signs of the ongoing differentiation process, such as reduction in the OKT9-reactive transferrin receptor, increase in lineage-specific surface markers, and decrease in [3H]thymidine incorporation and actual cell proliferation. The transcobalamin II receptor on the cell surface appears to be a proliferation-associated membrane component in human leukemic cells.","['Lindemans, J', 'Kroes, A C', 'van Geel, J', 'van Kapel, J', 'Schoester, M', 'Abels, J']","['Lindemans J', 'Kroes AC', 'van Geel J', 'van Kapel J', 'Schoester M', 'Abels J']","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '0 (transcobalamin receptor)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monensin/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Transcobalamins/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin B 12/metabolism/*pharmacokinetics']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1989 Oct;184(2):449-60. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(89)90343-1.,0014-4827 (Print) 0014-4827 (Linking),,['10.1016/0014-4827(89)90343-1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we have examined its mechanism of action on the erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cells (TSA8). TSA8 cells become responsive to erythropoietin after induction with DMSO. Stimulatory effects on erythropoietin response are observed with the addition of compounds affecting the cAMP level such as forskolin, phosphodiesterase inhibitor and cholera toxin only in the presence of erythropoietin. cAMP analogues themselves show no stimulatory effect on TSA8 cells, nor does erythropoietin increase cAMP level in the cells. Thus, it is suggested that cAMP does not act as a direct second messenger for signal transduction through erythropoietin receptors, but as a stimulator of the erythropoietin receptor pathway and/or as a second messenger in combination with the receptor pathway.

In this report we describe an interesting exception to the parallel phenotypic features of activated T cells and malignant CD4+ T cells. A monoclonal antibody (MoAb; termed 27.2) that was raised to HTLV-1+, CD4+25+ leukemic T cells stained weakly 25% of peripheral T cells, including approximately 50% of CD8+ T cells and 20% of CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the surface density of the 27.2 antigen was unchanged or diminished when normal T cells were activated by antigen. However, 3/4 Sezary cases and 4/8 cases of ATL had relatively high densities of the 27.2 antigen. Immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the NP-40-solubilized membranes of surface-iodinated ATL cells indicated that MoAb 27.2 reacted with a 75 Kd molecule. The size and distribution of the 27.2 antigen on T cell subsets suggested that it might be the enzyme ecto-5' nucleotidase (NT), a phosphatidylinositol-linked enzyme that catalyzes dephosphorylation of monophosphate nucleotides to their respective nucleosides. This was confirmed by demonstrating that lymphocyte ecto-5'NT activity was blocked partially and inhibited completely by preincubating cells with MoAb 27.2 for 1 hour at 4 degrees C and 24 hours at 37 degrees C, respectively. When used with a second MoAb (27.1) to a novel T cell activation antigen found on all CTCL and ATL leukemias examined, 27.2 was found to discriminate between normal and leukemic T cells in two patients with ATL. These studies suggest that ecto-5'NT has diagnostic value in T cell malignancies and may be aberrantly expressed in some cases of ATL and CTCL.","['Fukunaga, Y', 'Evans, S S', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Ueda, Y', 'Tamura, K', 'Takakuwa, T', 'Gebhard, D', 'Allopenna, J', 'Demaria, S', 'Clarkson, B']","['Fukunaga Y', 'Evans SS', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ueda Y', 'Tamura K', 'Takakuwa T', 'Gebhard D', 'Allopenna J', 'Demaria S', 'Clarkson B', 'et al.']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/immunology/*metabolism"", 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocytes/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Sezary Syndrome/*immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1989/11/15 00:00,1989/11/15 00:01,['1989/11/15 00:00'],"['1989/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1989/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1989 Nov 15;74(7):2486-92.,0006-4971 (Print) 0006-4971 (Linking),,['S0006-4971(20)82858-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

MPO expression was detected in most acute myeloid leukemias, and the level of expression correlated well with cytochemical enzymatic activity. No MPO message was detected in pure lymphoid leukemias, whereas very low basal levels of MPO transcripts were found in normal bone marrows. In four cases of acute undifferentiated leukemias cytochemically negative for MPO, significant levels of MPO transcripts were detected, suggesting a myeloid origin for these cases.

The single case (case 3) in which there were no lymphoid gene rearrangements at conversion was also the only case in which independent karyotypic abnormalities at diagnosis and conversion were demonstrated.

To assess the genetic and pathogenic consequences of these to the host, we have developed a strategy to distinguish among the three different host-range subgroups--xenotropic, polytropic and modified polytropic--by using oligonucleotide probes specific for a polymorphic region in env. Each of these proteins detects a relatively small number of bands in a Southern blot, thus permitting us to enumerate all individual proviruses of this group. Using this approach, we have determined the distribution of different proviruses among inbred and recombinant inbred (RI) strains congenic or coisogenic for specific mutants. Using the RI results, we have been able to place over 100 proviruses on the mouse genetic map. A number of these are closely linked to well-characterized mutations, and we have been able to establish that at least one mutation, hr (hairless), was caused by a proviral insertion. If the other close linkages also prove to reflect causality, we estimate that up to 5% of recessive mutations in the mouse might be caused by insertion of proviruses of this group. Using a similar probe strategy, we have followed the evolution of murine leukemia viruses during spontaneous leukemogenesis in AKR mice. We have found that the final leukemogenic (MCF) virus is a recombinant of three different endogenous parents; an ecotropic virus, a polytropic virus that directs the gp70 region of env, and a xenotropic virus (identified as the inducible element Bxv-1) that directs the LTR. In addition to the recombinations, all such viruses also have a reduplication of the enhancer region of the LTR, compared to the endogenous parent. MCF viruses are created by these three genetic changes, which occur in a reproducible fashion and appear in the thymus between 10 and 14 weeks of age.","['Coffin, J M', 'Stoye, J P', 'Frankel, W N']","['Coffin JM', 'Stoye JP', 'Frankel WN']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,,IM,"['Animals', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Oncogenes']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1989;567:39-49. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16457.x.,0077-8923 (Print) 0077-8923 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1989.tb16457.x [doi]'],['R35CA44385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,15,,,

The PBL's were increased to leukemic levels 3-21 weeks before death due to lymphoblastic leukemia. Lymphocyte proliferation and appearance of immature lymphocytes and lymphoblastic cells in the blood were a characteristic feature of tumour development following inoculation with an Australian strain of BLV. In contrast to a number of previous studies the peripheral lymph nodes of all infected sheep were clinically normal throughout the experimental period but at death gross tumours were evident in the mesentric lymph nodes and the heart in all cases. All the other lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney and lung were histologically infiltrated with lymphoid tumour cells. Gross tumours were present in the abomasum (1 out of 5) in the urinary tract (2 out of 5) and in the uterus (1 out of 2). The majority of the tumour cells isolated from the various tissues were centroblastic demonstrating that the malignant leukemia in experimentally infected sheep was of a multicentric centroblastic type.

These viruses cannot be propagated in any cell culture system. Because cloning cDNA copies of HPV mRNAs recovered from human lesions has met with only very limited success, the characterization of HPV mRNAs has been problematic. Using the Moloney murine leukemia virus vector system (C.L. Cepko, B.E. Roberts, and R.C. Mulligan, 1984, Cell 37, 1053-1062), we have recovered cDNAs of spliced E2 mRNAs of human papillomavirus type 11 and additional mRNAs of type 11 and type 18 and determined the utilization of open reading frames (ORFs) in the DNA sequences. The recovery of cDNA copies of messages with splice sites identical to those previously described strongly suggests that the newly characterized splice donors and acceptors are also authentic. The HPV-11 E2 cDNA contains the intact E6 and E7 ORFs and the beginning of the E1 ORF in the first exon, which is then spliced from nt 847 to the second exon at nt 2622, 100 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon for the E2 ORF. The initiation codon in the E1 ORF is followed by four additional in-frame AUG triplets and an in-frame termination codon positioned 30 nucleotides upstream from the initiation codon for the E2 protein. The authenticity of this putative E2 cDNA was shown by its ability to provide enhancer transactivating activity in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) assays in several cell lines. A mutation in the genomic DNA at this splice acceptor site eliminates its activity, demonstrating that the splice is essential for the expression of the E2 protein. We conclude that the translation of the HPV-11 E2 protein requires internal initiation.","['Rotenberg, M O', 'Chiang, C M', 'Ho, M L', 'Broker, T R', 'Chow, L T']","['Rotenberg MO', 'Chiang CM', 'Ho ML', 'Broker TR', 'Chow LT']","['Biochemistry Department, University of Rochester School of Medicine, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Viral/*analysis/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', '*Transfection']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1989 Oct;172(2):468-77. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(89)90189-x.,0042-6822 (Print) 0042-6822 (Linking),,['10.1016/0042-6822(89)90189-x [doi]'],"['CA36200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32CA09363/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,

Chronic exposure of B6C3F1 mice to BD produces a high incidence of thymic lymphoma (TL) that is not observed in rats. The potential of the endogenous ecotropic retroviral background to influence susceptibility to BD leukemogenesis was examined by comparing the incidence of TL between B6C3F1 and NIH swiss mice. Proviral ecotropic sequences are truncated in the NIH Swiss mouse, and the virus is not expressed. Chronic exposure to BD (1250 ppm) for up to 1 year resulted in a fourfold difference in the incidence of TL between B6C3F1 (57%) and NIH Swiss (14%) mice. These results provide presumptive evidence for retrovirus involvement since NIH Swiss mice lack ecotropic viruses and appear to be relatively resistant to induction of lymphoma by BD.","['Irons, R D', 'Cathro, H P', 'Stillman, W S', 'Steinhagen, W H', 'Shah, R S']","['Irons RD', 'Cathro HP', 'Stillman WS', 'Steinhagen WH', 'Shah RS']","['Molecular Toxicology & Environmental Health Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver 80262.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['0 (Butadienes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', 'JSD5FGP5VD (1,3-butadiene)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Butadienes/*toxicity', '*Cocarcinogenesis', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*etiology/microbiology', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Random Allocation', 'Species Specificity', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*complications']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 1989 Oct;101(1):170-6. doi: 10.1016/0041-008x(89)90222-6.,0041-008X (Print) 0041-008X (Linking),,['10.1016/0041-008x(89)90222-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The majority of acute non-lymphoblastic leukaemias (ANLL) express specific myeloid differentiation markers and are terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Tdt) negative. Rarely, some cases are Tdt+ and express the T-cell marker CD7. Although uncommon in Tdt-ANLL, there appears to be a significant incidence of T-cell receptor beta chain (TCR beta) and/or immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements in Tdt+ ANLLs. We have investigated the immunogenotype of 39 patients with ANLL, including 28 from whom immunophenotypic data were available. Thirty-seven of 39 cases had germline IgH and TCR beta genes. Two cases, one with a myeloid/CD7+ CD2+ immunophenotype, had non-germline IgH gene arrangements detectable on Hind III digests only. The possibility of Hind III polymorphisms, or of true somatic gene rearrangement of the IgH gene in these patients, is discussed. Two additional cases had a Tdt+ CD7+ immunophenotype with germline IgH and TCR beta chain genes. Our results confirm the infrequent occurrence of IgH and TCR beta gene rearrangements in ANLL. Expression of Tdt and/or CD7, often in association with IgH gene rearrangements, would appear to identify a subgroup of ANLL patients that respond poorly to standard ANLL therapy and have a poorer prognosis. The diagnostic and prognostic importance of multiparametric analysis in ANLL is emphasised.","['Papadopoulos, K P', 'Bagg, A', 'Bezwoda, W R', 'Mendelow, B V']","['Papadopoulos KP', 'Bagg A', 'Bezwoda WR', 'Mendelow BV']","['Department of Haematology, School of Pathology, South African Institute for Medical Research, Johannesburg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype']",1989/10/07 00:00,1989/10/07 00:01,['1989/10/07 00:00'],"['1989/10/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/07 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1989 Oct 7;76(7):335-8.,0256-9574 (Print),,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether the proviruses progressively acquired during tumor progression play a causal role in this process, we cloned one of them from a cell line derived from the primary tumor 2772. A probe from the cellular DNA flanking the provirus was used to analyze 79 DNA samples from primary tumor tissues of 28 tumor-bearing rats and 80 DNA samples from 30 independent tumor cell lines. This analysis revealed a rearrangement in this region in the primary tumor derived from the thymus of one animal but not in a clone of the same tumor segregating in the spleen. Of the cell line DNA samples, three carried a provirus in this region. Two of these integration events had occurred independently in two clonally related sublines derived from tumor 2772, and they were followed by rapid selection in culture. On the basis of these findings this locus was named Tpl-1 (tumor progression locus 1). The Tpl-1 locus was mapped to rat chromosome 8 and to mouse chromosome 9 at a genetic distance of 1.2 +/- 0.9 centimorgans from the Ets-1 protooncogene. Although the genetic distance between Tpl-1 and Ets-1 indicates that they are different genes, analysis of Tpl-1 cDNA clones revealed that the two are closely related.","['Bear, S E', 'Bellacosa, A', 'Lazo, P A', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Hanson, C', 'Levan, G', 'Tsichlis, P N']","['Bear SE', 'Bellacosa A', 'Lazo PA', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Hanson C', 'Levan G', 'Tsichlis PN']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA Transposable Elements)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*DNA Transposable Elements', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Gene Library', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, Viral', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*microbiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Proviruses/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*microbiology']",1989/10/01 00:00,1989/10/01 00:01,['1989/10/01 00:00'],"['1989/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1989 Oct;86(19):7495-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.86.19.7495.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.86.19.7495 [doi]'],"['CA-06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR-05539/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC298091,,,,,,,,

Previously we have shown that extracts of undifferentiated HL-60 cells possess a specific retinoid-binding activity (RSBP-1) corresponding to an approximate 95 kilodalton (kDa) protein as determined by size-exclusion chromatography. We now extend these observations to reveal a second approximate 95 kDa retinoic acid-binding component (RSBP-2), which is separable from RSBP-1 using anion exchange chromatography. We further show that the chromatographic properties of RSBP-1 and RSBP-2 are identical to those found for the retinoid-binding activities present in extracts of HeLa cells transfected with the human retinoic acid receptor (RAR) expression vectors RAR-beta phi and RAR-alpha phi, respectively. Moreover, an antiserum preparation directed against RAR-beta selectively immunoprecipitated both the retinoid-binding activity in extracts of HeLa cells transfected with RAR-beta phi and that corresponding to RSBP-1 in HL-60 cell extracts. Similarly, an antiserum preparation directed against RAR-alpha immunoprecipitated the retinoid-binding activity in extracts from RAR-alpha phi transfected HeLa cell as well as that corresponding to RSBP-2 in HL-60 cell extracts. Using these antisera, Western blot analyses of extracts from HL-60 cells, and from HeLa cells transfected with either RAR-alpha phi or RAR-beta phi, confirmed that RSBP-2 and RSBP-1 are identical to RAR-alpha and RAR-beta, respectively. However, RAR-alpha, RAR-beta, RSBP-1, and RSBP-2 appeared as an approximate 51 kDa species in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in contrast with an apparent approximate 95 k mol wt as estimated from size-exclusion chromatography in the presence of 0.6 M KCl.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Petkovich, M', 'Gaub, M P', 'Kagechika, H', 'Shudo, K', 'Chambon, P']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Petkovich M', 'Gaub MP', 'Kagechika H', 'Shudo K', 'Chambon P']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Chalcones)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Tetrahydronaphthalenes)', '08V52GZ3H9 (tamibarotene)', '5S5A2Q39HX (Chalcone)', ""95906-67-5 (3,5-di-tert-butylchalcone 4'-carboxylic acid)""]",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Benzoates', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis', 'Chalcone', 'Chalcones', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid', 'Tetrahydronaphthalenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1989/07/01 00:00,1989/07/01 00:01,['1989/07/01 00:00'],"['1989/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 1989 Jul;3(7):1046-52. doi: 10.1210/mend-3-7-1046.,0888-8809 (Print) 0888-8809 (Linking),,['10.1210/mend-3-7-1046 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

IBM inoculation of either FSC-infected feline marrow cells or fibroblasts of weanling cats bypassed age-related restriction of FSC replication, initiated viremia, caused irreversible depletion of erythroid burst forming units, and induced rapid fatal aplastic anemia. A second significant finding observed with FSC infection was pronounced systemic lymphoid depletion. The direct bone marrow inoculation system described facilitates experimental study of retrovirus-target cell interactions involved in erythroid aplasia.","['Dornsife, R E', 'Gasper, P W', 'Mullins, J I', 'Hoover, E A']","['Dornsife RE', 'Gasper PW', 'Mullins JI', 'Hoover EA']","['Department of Pathology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins 80523.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,['X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/microbiology', 'Cat Diseases/*microbiology', 'Cats', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*pathogenicity', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Methylprednisolone/pharmacology']",1989/01/01 00:00,1989/01/01 00:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1989/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1989;13(9):745-55. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(89)90087-8.,0145-2126 (Print) 0145-2126 (Linking),,"['0145-2126(89)90087-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(89)90087-8 [doi]']","['KO1-CA01058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI25273/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA48594/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,
