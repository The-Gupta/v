Here we show that genetic inhibition of endosomal TLRs has the opposite effect on accumulation of MYD88(L265P) B cells in vitro and in vivo. Activated mature B cells from wild-type, Unc93b1(3d/3d)-mutant, or Tlr9-deficient mice were transduced with retrovirus encoding MYD88(L265P) and analyzed either in vitro or after transplantation into Rag1(-/-) recipient mice. Unc93b1(3d/3d) mutation, which blocks TLR9 and TLR7 signaling, or Tlr9 deficiency suppressed MYD88(L265P) B-cell growth in vitro but paradoxically increased in vivo accumulation of MYD88(L265P) B cells as CD19(low) plasmablasts by 10- to 100-fold. These results reveal an unexpected, powerful inhibitory effect of TLR9 on MYD88(L265P) B-cell proliferation and differentiation that appears independent of TLR7, and they provide a preclinical indicator for caution in clinical trials of TLR7/9 inhibitors for MYD88(L265P) B-cell malignancies.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Wang, James Q', 'Beutler, Bruce', 'Goodnow, Christopher C', 'Horikawa, Keisuke']","['Wang JQ', 'Beutler B', 'Goodnow CC', 'Horikawa K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8534-255X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5296-6155', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7381-9450']","['Australian Cancer Research Foundation Department of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia;', 'Center for the Genetics of Host Defense, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX; and.', 'Immunology Division, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia.', 'Australian Cancer Research Foundation Department of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, Australia;']",['eng'],['U19 AI100627/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160725,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Myd88 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Tlr9 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', '0 (UNC93B1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*chemistry/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/*metabolism', 'Plasma Cells/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology']",PMC5034740,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/08/29 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34120-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-03-708065 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 22;128(12):1604-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-03-708065.

We assessed the transforming properties of the alternatively spliced AE isoform AE9a (or alternative splicing at exon 9), which is fully transforming in a murine retroviral model, in human cord blood cells. Full activity was realized only upon increased fusion protein expression. This effect was recapitulated in the AE9a murine AML model. Cotransduction of AE and AE9a resulted in a strong selective pressure for AE-expressing cells. In the context of AE, AE9a did not show selection for increased expression, affirming observations of human t(8;21) patient samples where full-length AE is the dominant protein detected.

Here, we report a detail characterization of a c-myb-gfp transgenic zebrafish harboring c-Myb hyperactivity (named c-myb(hyper)). This line exhibits abnormal granulocyte expansion that resembles human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) from embryonic stage to adulthood. Strikingly, a small portion of c-myb(hyper) adult fish develops acute myeloid leukemia-like or acute lymphoid leukemia-like disorders with age. The myeloid and lymphoid malignancies in c-myb(hyper) adult fish are likely caused by the hyperactivity of c-myb, resulting in the dysregulation of a number of cell-cycle-related genes and hyperproliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. Finally, treatment with c-myb target drug flavopiridol can relieve the MDS-like symptoms in both c-myb(hyper) embryos and adult fish.

Preliminary results of allografting with phenotypically matched unrelated donors suggest that the mortality of the procedure is greater than that of HLA-identical sibling transplants but that some patients will proved to have been cured.,,"['Goldman, J M']",['Goldman JM'],,"['a MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009050991 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;3(3):159-64. doi: 10.3109/10428199009050991.,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'chronic granulocytic leukaemia', 'management']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of extracellular acidic pH on proliferation, invasion, and drug-induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic cells. The cells were cultured in different pH (pH 6.6 and pH 7.4) for 12 days. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay and cell invasion was assayed by invasion assay and gene expression analysis of MMP-9. Drug-induced apoptosis was evaluated after exposure to doxorubicin for 24 hours by annexin V/PI staining and gene expression analysis of BAX pro-apoptotic protein. The results indicated the enhanced growth and invasion of leukemic cells at pH 6.6 (P </= 0.05). Furthermore, the cells at pH 6.6 were resistant to apoptosis by doxorubicin (P </= 0.05). It can be concluded that acidic pH increases the proliferation, invasion and reduces the drug-induced apoptosis in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In contrast to the rapid induction of these oncogene products by the phorbol ester TPA (which directly activates PKC) alone or in combination with the calcium ionophore A23187, stimulation of c-fos, c-jun and c-myc mRNA expression by TNF is significantly delayed. A later onset of action mediated by TNF has similarly been reported for the induction of DNA synthesis and of gene expression following gene transfer in B-CLL cells.

The induction of the lysosomal enzyme tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was examined at the RNA (by Northern blotting analysis) and the protein level (by isoelectric focusing). TRAP mRNA and protein were induced by treatment with PKC activators while the combination of PKC stimulator and calcium ionophore was not effective, TRAP mRNA was detected as early as 2 hours after initiation of the culture. This induction of positivity for TRAP which is the enzymatic hallmark of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) by TPA or Bryo is consistent with the previously reported acquisition of HCL-type cellular features in TPA-driven CLL cells; CLL cells exposed to the double stimulus of TPA or Bryo + A23187 have previously been described to differentiate to plasmacytoid cells which is in accord with their remaining TRAP negative. The present data provide evidence that 1) B-CLL cells can be induced by direct stimulation of PKC to convert to HCL-type cells; 2) TPA/Bryo-exposed B-CLL cells display phenotypes different from those of cells treated with combinations containing calcium ionophore; 3) the phosphoinositol signal transduction pathway distal to PKC can be activated effectively in B-CLL cells; 4) Bryo, a new natural PKC activator, induces responses in CLL similar to those caused by TPA; 5) TRAP is an inducible indicator of cellular activation.

Sixty-five cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) including 10 T-ALL, 6 non-T ALL designated groups I and II (HLA-DRCALLA), 48 non-T ALL termed groups III and IV (HLA-DRCALLA) and one B-ALL were studied; 10 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) were also analysed. The estimation of the relative fluorescence index (RFI) on leukemic blasts led to the derivation of mean values for each marker in the leukemia subgroups. We have quantitated the levels of the antigens generally used in the classification of these leukemias (CALLA, CD5, CD20, CD13, HLA-DR and CD19) and of other cell surface antigens associated with leukemic cells. For example, CALLA (CD10) level was high (mean RFI value of 26.4) on the leukemic cells of non-T ALL groups III and IV. The CD5 antigen was present on T-ALL, as expected, with an RFI value of 4.5; however, low levels were observed on the more immature non-T ALL of groups I and II (RFI = 2.3 on only 27% of blast cells). The quantitative analysis of the cell surface antigens associated with non-T ALL has revealed molecules such as CALLA, HLA-DR, CD9 and CD44 present at high and variable levels and others such as CD19, CD38, 44G4, 44D7, 44H9 and 44H6 generally of lower intensity, less variable from one patient to another, and with similar mean levels of expression in the different subgroups. These invariable antigens are not altered by the lineage or stage of differentiation of the leukemic cells. The variable antigens could be correlated with the functional and/or differentiation status of the cells and could also be modified by the alterations of regulatory processes associated with malignancy. The quantitation of multiple leukemia-associated antigens, whose structure and function are becoming rapidly established, should help in elucidating the function of these molecules in leukemogenesis and/or disease progression.",,"['Kreindler, D', 'Petsche, D', 'Hrincu, A', 'Gougos, A', 'Quackenbush, E J', 'Freedman, M H', 'Gelfand, E W', 'Letarte, M']","['Kreindler D', 'Petsche D', 'Hrincu A', 'Gougos A', 'Quackenbush EJ', 'Freedman MH', 'Gelfand EW', 'Letarte M']",,"['a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'b Hematology-Oncology, Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'c Division of Basic Sciences and Raymond and Beverley Sackler Foundation Laboratory, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO, 80206, USA.', 'a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.', 'a Divisions of Immunology Hospital for Sick Childrenj and Departments of Immunology and Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, M5G 1X8.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009050970 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;3(1):7-18. doi: 10.3109/10428199009050970.,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'Leukemia', 'antigens', 'phenotype']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, the introduction of monoclonal antibodies significantly inhibiting the immune system such as rituximab has led to an increase in PML cases. Although rituximab-based immunochemotherapy remains the standard of treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the importance of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as ibrutinib is steadily increasing. However, long-term experiences regarding possible side effects of these new substances are rare. Here, we report the development of eventually fatal PML possibly associated with ibrutinib therapy for CLL after multiple prior treatment lines, including rituximab. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report such findings. Since the last course of rituximab was applied over 3 years ago, it is conceivable that the strong B cell inhibition by ibrutinib led to PML.

Seven patients (of whom, 6 were > 50 years) died in aplasia during the induction phase and four additional patients (all elderly) died during post-remission intensification without recurrent disease. Subsequently, the younger patients received transplants (BMT: 4 pts; ABMT: 10 pts). Twelve: of the 52 (23%) who survived post remission intensification (BMT: 1; ABMT: 4; others: 7) are disease free survivors 9-67 months (median, 32 months) after achieving CR. In conclusion, this intensive chemotherapy regimen is highly effective both in young and odder patients but the post-remission intensification may be too aggressive for elderly patients.",,"['Carella, A M', 'Gaozza, E', 'Piatti, G', 'Nati, S', 'Pungoltno, E', 'Santini, G', 'Giordano, D', 'Cerri, R', 'Risso, M', 'Rossi, E', 'Spriano, M', 'Coingiu, A', 'Carlier, P', 'Raffo, M R', 'Damagio, E', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Marmont, A M']","['Carella AM', 'Gaozza E', 'Piatti G', 'Nati S', 'Pungoltno E', 'Santini G', 'Giordano D', 'Cerri R', 'Risso M', 'Rossi E', 'Spriano M', 'Coingiu A', 'Carlier P', 'Raffo MR', 'Damagio E', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Marmont AM']",,"['a Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit and Division of Haematology, Ospedale S.

Therefore, the choice of this oral agent to treat elderly acute non-lymphoid leukemias (ANLL) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) on an out-patient basis is attractive for obvious reasons. In this review we summarize the pharmacological characteristics of IDR, its use in the treatment off acute leukemia, and results reported until now in the literature and our sown results using oral IDR in elderly ANLL and MDS patients. IDR given orally at a total dose of 30 mg/m(2) to 90 mg/m(2) induced complete and partial overall responses, in approximately 50% of elderly ANLL and MDS. These results are comparable to those obtained in the same age category using low dose ARA-C, but with less drug toxicity for the patients.

All infants, eight male and eleven female. were 1 year of age or less at presentation of their disease and all showed the typical clinical features of ALL in infancy: hyperleucocytosis, organomegaly, frequent central nervous system (CNS) disease and one infant had cutaneous lesions. In the 17 cases which were successfully karyotyped, translocation of chromosome 11 involving band q23 were demonstrated in 16 cases (94%). The majority fell into the B precursor, or ""null"" ALL, category (CD10 negative, but CD19 and HLA DR positive), two cases, however, showed concomitant expression of B cell and myeloid (CD13 and CD33) markers. Two cases were CD10, HLA DR and CD19 positive and in one of these as well as one of the CD10 negative cases, 25-30%, of the blast cells expressed cytoplasmic Ig, M, a characteristic of pre-B cells. All cases, irrespective of phenotype or karyotype, showed rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes (IgH), but no light chain rearrangement. Together with the expression of B cell associated markers this, provided good evidence of their B lineage. No rearrangements of the beta or gamma chains of the T cell receptor complex (TcR) were seen in any case, nor was any rearrangement of the insulin receptor, which maps to band 19p13, seen in the cases with the t(11;19) translocation. The prognosis was uniformly poor. The majority of cases relapsed rapidly in the bone marrow whilst on therapy and within the first six months after diagnosis. Within the group of 19 infants studied, those with the t(11;19) translocation appeared to form a subgroup with the worst prognostic features (WBC averaging 591 x 10(9)/1, profound organomegaly and proven CNS disease in 4/7). 4/7 of this subgroup received no treatment and of the three who were treated, two relapsed within the first 11 months of treatment.",,"['Katz, F', 'Ball, S', 'Gibbons, B']","['Katz F', 'Ball S', 'Gibbons B']",,"['a Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, WCI, UK.', 'b Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospital for Sick Children, Great Ormond St, London, WCI, UK.', 'a Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, WCI, UK.', 'a Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, WCI, UK.', 'c Department of Medical Oncology, St Bartholomews Hospital, London, ECI, UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,,,,1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428199009106460 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 1990;2(5):259-69. doi: 10.3109/10428199009106460.,['NOTNLM'],['Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia infants'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALV-J variants in tissues from four different organs of the same bird were re-isolated in DF-1 cells, and their gp85 gene was amplified and cloned. Ten clones from each organ were sequenced and compared with the original inoculum strain, NX0101. The minimum homology of each organ ranged from 96.7 to 97.6%, and the lowest homology between organs was only 94.9%, which was much lower than the 99.1% homology of inoculum NX0101, indicating high diversity of ALV-J, even within the same bird. The gp85 mutations from the left kidney, which contained tumors, and the right kidney, which was tumor-free, had higher non-synonymous to synonymous mutation ratios than those in the tumor-bearing liver and lungs. Additionally, the mutational sites of gp85 gene in the kidney were similar, and they differed from those in the liver and lung, implying that organ- or tissue-specific selective pressure had a greater influence on the evolution of ALV-J diversity.

In previous studies using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) we found that alFN induced unique membrane alterations in target hairy cells in vitro. In addition, aIFN was shown to enhance the expression of HLA class II antigens on HCL cells, to induce the production of new proteins in such cells, and to lower the high levels of soluble IL-2 receptors in the serum of HCL patients. In the light of these results, and the fact that restoration of natural killer cell activity occurs in aIFN-treated patients well after the hematologic profile begins to improve, our studies have focused on the hypothesis that IFNs act directly on the target malignant cells, leading to the elimination of these cells either by inhibiting the proliferation of the malignant cells and/or triggering changes in the differentiation status of the malignant cells that lead to suppression (cytoconversion) of the malignant phenotype.

A series of rat monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) with CDw52 specificity but of varying immunoglobulin isotype has been produced, and assessed for ability to deplete lymphoid cells in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders. Although all IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b rat MAbs were able to elicit lysis with human complement in vitro, only the IgG2b MAb (CAMPATH-1G) could elicit substantial lymphoid depletion in vivo. The efficacy of CAMPATH-1 G probably results from its ability to bind human Fc receptors and activate cell-mediated lysis of antibody-coated cells. Twenty-nine patients with lymphoid malignancies have received between 250 mg and 680 mg of CAMPATH-1G; nine of these attained complete remission A human MAb with CDw52 specificity has been produced by ""grafting"" the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the rat MAb into human IgG1 heavy- and kappa light-chain genes.

The graft versus leukemia effect may be mediated by IL-2 activation of natural killer cells (CD16 +, CD56 +, CD3-, CD8+/-) or cytotoxic T cells (CD3 +, CD56+/-). These activated killer cells can bind to targets and cause their lysis, and then recirculate to kill other targets. Killing can be blocked by anti-perforin antibodies and enhanced by protein kinase C-activation of effectors There are several studies indicating that a high percentage of leukemic cells can be killed by LAK-cells. However even in the most sensitive cases, lysis of all the cells cannot be achieved. The finding that leukemic clonogenic cells are generally sensitive to both NK and LAK cytotoxicity provides a more hopeful possibility The lack of tumor specific antigents, leukemic cell-immunoheterogeneity and maturation asynchrony explains why antigen dependent T-cell mediated cytotoxicity is only partly effective in eradicating residual leukemic cells.

Studies of leukemia demonstrated that P-gp may also be secreted in an intact soluble form. The purpose of this study was to explore whether sinonasal epithelial cells were capable of secreting soluble P-gp and whether P-gp has any functional role. METHODS: Soluble and cytoplasmic P-gp were quantified in vehicle and lipopolysaccharide exposed cultures by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The molecular weight of the soluble P-gp was determined by Western blot. Naive cultures were exposed to recombinant human P-gp at 0-2000 ng/mL. The degree of membranous interpolation was determined by quantitative fluorescent immunocytochemistry and function was determined by a calcein acetoxymethyl ester assay. RESULTS: Soluble P-gp was secreted intact at 170 kDa. Mean (standard deviation) secretion was detected within vehicle wells at 55.43 +/- 26.26 ng/mL, which significantly increased to 333.27 +/- 305.98 ng/mL (p < 0.001) after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Soluble P-gp strongly and significantly correlated with cytoplasmic P-gp (r = 0.57, p = 0.000001). Exposure to 2000 ng/mL of recombinant P-gp significantly increased corrected total cell fluorescence (1.34 +/- 1.85) relative to vehicle control 0.29 +/- 0.26 (p = 0.01) and significantly reduced calcein acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence (82.03 +/- 43.69) relative to 100 ng/mL recombinant P-gp exposed cells (123.11 +/- 42.16, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Cultured sinonasal epithelial cells were able to both secrete intact P-gp and could functionally interpolate soluble P-gp into their cell membrane. These in vitro findings indicated that soluble P-gp may be present in nasal mucus as a biomarker and could participate in the maintenance of P-gp overexpression in chronic rhinosinusitis and associated inflammation.",,"['Nocera, Angela L', 'Meurer, Ana T', 'Singleton, Amy', 'Simons, Christopher', 'BuSaba, Joseph', 'Tara Gass, Nicole', 'Han, Xue', 'Bleier, Benjamin S']","['Nocera AL', 'Meurer AT', 'Singleton A', 'Simons C', 'BuSaba J', 'Tara Gass N', 'Han X', 'Bleier BS']",,"['Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Rhinol Allergy,American journal of rhinology & allergy,101490775,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Nasal Mucosa/cytology/*metabolism']",,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/03/11 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.2500/ajra.2016.30.4330 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Rhinol Allergy. 2016 Jul;30(4):246-9. doi: 10.2500/ajra.2016.30.4330.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In four a monoclonally rearranged band could still be detected, while in another four, reversal of fibrosis and hemopoietic recovery wits coupled with the absence of a molecularly recognizable neoplastic clone. In the last (case, persistence of disease paralleled the findings in the peripheral blood cells. These data indicate that alpha-IFPJ is capable of producing a specific cytolytic effect on the leukemic population in HCL, which in some cases may lead to complete clonal remissions.

At present, no epidemiological data regarding ICH in patients with hematologic disorders has been collected and/or reported in Thailand. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of ICH in hospitalized patients with hematologic disorders and to identify predictive factors associated with ICH in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The medical records of all patients with hematologic disorders admitted to Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) between January 2002 and September 2011 were reviewed. Patients with ICH were identified and factors associated with ICH were investigated using a retrospective case-control design. RESULTS: Of 9,62 patients identified with hematologic disorders, ICH was diagnosed in 106 (1.1%). The ICH rate was higher in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients than in patients with other hematologic malignancies (4.29% vs. 0.78%; p<0. 001) and higher in aplastic anemia (AA) patients than in patients with other benign hematologic disorders (4.00% vs. 0.97%; p<0.001). Cortical hemorrhage was the main presentation in all hematologic disorders, with a single lesion in the parietal area as the most common site. The overall mortality rate was 85% with most patients succumbing within two days of onset. The independent predictors of ICH were hyperleukocytosis and a low platelet count in AML patients, and ecchymosis, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hematuria, and a low platelet count in AA patients. CONCLUSION: AML and AA patients had the highest risk of ICH compared with other hematologic disorders and several predictive factors for ICH were identified.",,"['Owattanapanich, Weerapat', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Owattanapanich W', 'Auewarakul CU']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,J Med Assoc Thai,Journal of the Medical Association of Thailand = Chotmaihet thangphaet,7507216,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Hemophilia A/*epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Odds Ratio', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Thailand/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",,2016/07/28 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/07/27 06:00'],"['2016/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Med Assoc Thai. 2016 Jan;99(1):15-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a new nanotechnology-based drug delivery method was developed using gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as a delivery vehicle to reduce adverse drug side effects. Fludarabine Phosphate is a commercial chemotherapy drug used in cancer treatment, and has ability to kill various cancer cells. KG-1 cell, a type of acute cancer leukemia cell, was selected as a proof-of-concept target in this study. Due to the small size of GNPs, they can help Fludarabine Phosphate enter cancer cells more efficiently and better interfere with DNA synthesis in the cancer cells. To enhance targeting ability, folic acid molecules were also covalently linked to GNPs, resulting in GNP-Fludarabine-folic acid (GNP-F/f). Compared to treatments with GNP-F or drugs on its own (Fludarabine Phosphate), the GNP-F/f achieves much improved cell-killing effects. The UV-Vis spectra results also revealed that the drugs had successfully bonded covalently to the GNPs. The higher cell-killing efficiency of GNP-F/f compared with GNP-Fludarabine (GNP-F) or drugs on their own further validates the effectiveness of both the vectors (GNPs) and folic acid in enhancing the drug delivery to the cancer cells.

Oligonucleotide-based technologies to down regulate these molecular targets have promising therapeutic efficacy. However, there is relatively limited success in translating this into effective in vivo cancer therapeutics. The primary challenge is the lack of effective cancer cell-targeted delivery methods, particularly for a systemic disease such as leukemia. We developed a novel leukemia-targeting compound composed of a monoclonal antibody directly conjugated to an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Our compound uses an ASO that specifically targets the transcription factor MAX dimerization protein 3 (MXD3), which was previously identified to be critical for precursor B cell (preB) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell survival. The MXD3 ASO was conjugated to an anti-CD22 antibody (alphaCD22 Ab) that specifically targets most preB ALL. We demonstrated that the alphaCD22 Ab-ASO conjugate treatment showed MXD3 protein knockdown and leukemia cell apoptosis in vitro. We also demonstrated that the conjugate treatment showed cytotoxicity in normal B cells, but not in other hematopoietic cells, including hematopoietic stem cells. Furthermore, the conjugate treatment at the lowest dose tested (0.2mg/kg Ab for 6 doses - twice a week for 3 weeks) more than doubled the mouse survival time in both Reh (median survival time 20.5 vs. 42.5 days, p<0.001) and primary preB ALL (median survival time 29.3 vs. 63 days, p<0.001) xenograft models. Our conjugate that uses alphaCD22 Ab to target the novel molecule MXD3, which is highly expressed in preB ALL cells, appears to be a promising novel therapeutic approach.",,"['Satake, Noriko', 'Duong, Connie', 'Yoshida, Sakiko', 'Oestergaard, Michael', 'Chen, Cathy', 'Peralta, Rachael', 'Guo, Shuling', 'Seth, Punit P', 'Li, Yueju', 'Beckett, Laurel', 'Chung, Jong', 'Nolta, Jan', 'Nitin, Nitin', 'Tuscano, Joseph M']","['Satake N', 'Duong C', 'Yoshida S', 'Oestergaard M', 'Chen C', 'Peralta R', 'Guo S', 'Seth PP', 'Li Y', 'Beckett L', 'Chung J', 'Nolta J', 'Nitin N', 'Tuscano JM']",,"['Department of Pediatrics.', 'Stem Cell Program.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Stem Cell Program.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Stem Cell Program.', 'Isis Pharmaceuticals.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Stem Cell Program.', 'Isis Pharmaceuticals.', 'Isis Pharmaceuticals.', 'Isis Pharmaceuticals.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences.', 'Department of Public Health Sciences.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Stem Cell Program.', 'Departments of Food Science & Technology and Biological & Agricultural Engineering.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of California, Davis.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA093373/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM099688/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000002/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160722,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,,,,PMC5082301,2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/26 06:00'],"['2015/09/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]', '2016/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['molmed.2015.00210 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2015.00210 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Med. 2016 Oct;22:632-642. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2015.00210.

We found that oral administration of QXJYD significantly reduced the elevation of systolic blood pressure in SHR but had no effect on body weight change. Additionally, QXJYD treatment significantly decreased the media thickness and ratio of media thickness/lumen diameter in the carotid arteries of SHR. Moreover, QXJYD remarkably promoted apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced the expression of anti-apoptotic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2.

Bilateral renal aneurysm rupture is a rare and life threatening complication. Although uncommon, PAN has been associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of a 77-year-old female with a known CMML, presented to hospital with abdominal pain. Left initially and right renal microaneurym ruptures were shown in CT scan within one-week interval. Microaneurysms were treated with embolization with microcoils. A diagnosis of PAN was made and treated with successful outcome with steroids, cyclophosphamide.

However, it remains still under investigation which molecular factors may influence CML risk or varying responses to TKIs. The aim of this study was to assess the role of Glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) genetic polymorphisms in CML susceptibility and TKI clinical outcome. MATERIALS: Deletion polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and the single nucleotide polymorphism in GSTP1 c.319A>G (rs1695; p.105Ile>Val) were genotyped by PCR methods in 141 CML treated patients and 141 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals. RESULTS: Individual analysis of each GST gene showed no association with CML risk. A trend toward significance (p=0.07) for a recessive model was found for GSTP1 (OR: 2.04; CI: 0.94-4.4). However, the combined analysis showed that GSTM1-null/GSTP1-GG as well as GSTT1-null/GSTP1-GG were associated with CML development (p=0.03; OR: 3.54 CI: 1.2-14.57; p=0.05; OR: 12.65; CI: 1.17-21.5). The relationship with treatment outcome showed that the presence of GSTM1 gene was significantly linked with an inferior rate of major molecular response (p=0.048) and poor event free-survival (EFS) (p=0.02). Furthermore, a group of patients with GSTP1-GG genotype were significantly associated with reduced EFS comparing to those carrying other GSTP1 genotypes (p=0.049). GSTP1-GG genotypes had short time to treatment failure in a group of patients unresponsive to TKIs comparing to other GSTP1 genotypes (p=0.03).

Although therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is highly effective for CML, multiple factors have been identified as predictive of treatment failure. Chromosomal abnormalities involving the MECOM locus at 3q26 portend therapy resistant disease in adults, yet have never been described in pediatric patients and have not been associated with T lymphoblastic progression. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of an 11-year-old boy with CML possessing the unique combination of T lymphoblastic transformation and a subclone harboring inv(3)(q21q26.2) at diagnosis. This is the first reported case of pediatric CML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) and the first case of T lymphoblastic progression associated with this karyotype. The patient was treated with single agent TKI therapy with robust initial response. Marrow histology at one month showed restoration of trilineage hematopoiesis and BCR-ABL RT-PCR at three months showed a 1.4 log reduction in transcript levels. CONCLUSIONS: The karyotypic abnormality of inv(3)(q21q26.2) in CML is not restricted to adult patients. Moreover, while chromosome 3 abnormalities are markers of TKI resistance in adults, our patient showed a robust early response to single agent TKI therapy. This finding suggests pediatric CML with inv(3)(q21q26.2) may have distinct features and more favorable treatment responses than those described in adults.",,"['Lewen, Margaret', 'Gresh, Renee', 'Queenan, Maria', 'Paessler, Michele', 'Pillai, Vinodh', 'Hexner, Elizabeth', 'Frank, Dale', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Aplenc, Richard', 'Caywood, Emi', 'Wertheim, Gerald']","['Lewen M', 'Gresh R', 'Queenan M', 'Paessler M', 'Pillai V', 'Hexner E', 'Frank D', 'Bagg A', 'Aplenc R', 'Caywood E', 'Wertheim G']",,"[""Department of Medicine, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts USA."", 'Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA."", ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA."", 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA."", 'Nemours Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders, Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children, Wilmington, Delaware USA.', ""Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA.""]",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160722,England,Biomark Res,Biomarker research,101607860,,,,PMC4957483,2016/07/28 06:00,2016/07/28 06:01,['2016/07/26 06:00'],"['2016/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40364-016-0069-0 [doi]', '69 [pii]']",epublish,Biomark Res. 2016 Jul 22;4:14. doi: 10.1186/s40364-016-0069-0. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['Additional chromosomal abnormalities', 'Blast phase', 'Case report', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'MECOM']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is most commonly identified in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, and less often in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) and other myeloproliferative disorders. It is most commonly reported in the periosteum, bone, skin, and lymph nodes but has been reported in many other sites of the body. Herein, we describe a case of MS involving the periprostatic tissue and review of literature of MS of the prostate. Our patient was initially diagnosed with MDS and was in remission following successful treatment. Six months later, the patient was diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma, and MS of the periprostatic tissue was incidentally discovered in the postprostatectomy pathology specimen. An extensive review of literature from 1997 to 2014 revealed a total of eight cases of MS involving the prostate. Of the eight cases of MS of the prostate, four were primary MS (absence of a history of leukemia) and four were secondary MS. Three received local radiation to the prostate with relief of obstructive symptoms, and one of them had a repeat prostate biopsy negative for leukemic cells.

We analyzed 172 consecutive acute leukemia patients transplanted in complete remission after a T cell-replete alloHCT from either a matched related (MRD, n = 54), unrelated (MUD, n = 67), or haploidentical (haplo, n = 51) donor to look for patient-, disease-, and transplant-related factors associated with post-transplant outcomes. Patients included 123 acute myeloid leukemia patients (first complete remission [CR], n = 94; second CR, n = 28; third CR, n = 1) and 49 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients (first CR, n = 39; second CR, n = 9; third CR, n = 1) with a median age of 50 years (range, 19 to 74). Median follow-up for surviving patients was 38 months. Cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 1 and 3 years was 6% and 17%, respectively. The estimated rates of 3-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and relapse incidence were 59%, 50%, and 33%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for inferior survival included diagnosis of ALL, high risk disease risk index, and use of a female donor for a male recipient. Donor type (MRD, MUD, haplo) had no impact on any transplant outcome. Given the favorable outcomes associated with alloHCT in acute leukemia and lack of effect of donor type, a strong case can be made for transplanting acute leukemia patients in remission as soon as any donor becomes available.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In this retrospective study including 305 paediatric ALL patients undergoing maintenance therapy, we systematically investigated the individual and combined effects of genetic variants of folate pathway enzymes, as well as of polymorphisms in PACSIN2 and ITPA, on drug-induced toxicities by applying a multi-analytical approach including logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART) and generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR). In addition to the TPMT genotype, confirmed to be a major determinant of drug related toxicities, we identified the PACSIN2 rs2413739TT genotype as being a significant risk factor for 6-MP-induced toxicity in wild-type TPMT patients. A gene-gene interaction between MTRR (rs1801394) and MTHFR (rs1801133) was detected by GMDR and proved to have an independent effect on the risk of stomatitis, as shown by LR analysis.

Signals from the CLL microenvironment promote progression of the disease and induce drug resistance. This phenomenon is largely dependent on direct contact between the malignant B cells and stromal cells. CD84 belongs to the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule family of immunoreceptors, which self-associates, forming an orthogonal homophilic dimer. We therefore hypothesized that CD84 may bridge between CLL cells and their microenvironment, promoting cell survival. Our in vitro results show that CD84 expressed on CLL cells interact with CD84 expressed on cells in their microenvironment, inducing cell survival in both sides. Blocking CD84 in vitro and in vivo disrupt the interaction of CLL cells with their microenvironment, resulting in induced cell death.

So, this enzyme is used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a malignant disorder in children. This enzyme is also able to reduce the amount of acrylamide found in carbohydrate-rich fried and baked foods which is carcinogenic to humans. The concentration of acrylamide in food can be reduced by deamination of asparagine using l-Asparaginase. l-Asparaginase is present in plants, animals, and microbes. Various microorganisms such as bacteria, yeast, and fungi are generally used for the production of l-Asparaginase as it is difficult to obtain the same from plants and animals. l-Asparaginase from bacteria causes anaphylaxis and other abnormal sensitive reactions. To overcome this, eukaryotic organisms such as fungi can be used for the production of l-Asparaginase. l-Asparaginase can be produced either by solid-state fermentation (SSF) or by submerged fermentation (SmF). SSF is preferred over SmF as it is cost effective, eco-friendly and it delivers high yield of enzyme. SSF process utilizes agricultural and industrial wastes as solid substrate. The contamination level is substantially reduced in SSF through low moisture content.

Despite the fact that ComC cleavage fragments alone do not chemoattract normal HSPCs, we found that leukemia cell lines as well as clonogenic blasts from chronic myeloid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia patients respond robustly to C3 and C5 cleavage fragments by chemotaxis and increased adhesion. This finding was supported by the detection of C3a and C5a receptors in cells from human malignant hematopoietic cell lines and patient blasts at the mRNA (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction) and protein level (fluorescence-activated cell sorting), and by the demonstration that these receptors respond to stimulation by C3a and C5a by phosphorylation of p42/44 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and protein kinase B (PKB/AKT). We also found that inducible heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) is a negative regulator of ComC-mediated trafficking of leukemic cells, and that stimulation of leukemic cells by C3 or C5 cleavage fragments activates p38 MAPK, which downregulates HO-1 expression, rendering cells more mobile. We conclude that activation of the ComC in leukemia/lymphoma patients (for example, as a result of accompanying infections) enhances the motility of malignant cells and contributes to their spread in a p38 MAPK-HO-1-dependent manner. Therefore, inhibition of p38 MAPK or upregulation of HO-1 by small-molecule modulators would have a beneficial effect on ameliorating cell migration-mediated expansion of leukemia/lymphoma cells when the ComC becomes activated.",,"['Abdelbaset-Ismail, A', 'Borkowska-Rzeszotek, S', 'Kubis, E', 'Bujko, K', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus, K', 'Bolkun, L', 'Kloczko, J', 'Moniuszko, M', 'Basak, G W', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak, W', 'Ratajczak, M Z']","['Abdelbaset-Ismail A', 'Borkowska-Rzeszotek S', 'Kubis E', 'Bujko K', 'Brzezniakiewicz-Janus K', 'Bolkun L', 'Kloczko J', 'Moniuszko M', 'Basak GW', 'Wiktor-Jedrzejczak W', 'Ratajczak MZ']",,"['Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Physiology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Multi-Specialist Hospital, Gorzow Wielkopolski, Poland.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Stem Cell Institute at James Graham Brown Cancer Center, University of Louisville, Louisville, KY, USA.', 'Department of Regenerative Medicine, Warsaw Medical University, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['R01 DK074720/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL112788/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160725,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Complement C3)', '0 (Complement C5)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/immunology', 'Chemotaxis/genetics/immunology', 'Complement Activation/*immunology', 'Complement C3/immunology/metabolism', 'Complement C5/immunology/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*genetics', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptor, Anaphylatoxin C5a/genetics/metabolism', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC5288274,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/07/26 06:00'],"['2016/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016198 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.198 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):446-458. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.198.

Conversely, SCF/c-Kit signaling positively regulates Slug through downstream c-Myc and FoxM1 transcription factors. Intriguingly, c-Kit expression is induced by SCF/c-Kit signaling in Slug-deficient HSCs. The balance between Slug and c-Kit is critical for maintaining HSC repopulating potential in vivo.

However, detailed mechanism of TSA action on lymphoma remains to be described. In the present study, anti-proliferative effects of TSA were investigated using a murine pro-B lymphoma cell line FL5.12. MTT assay revealed that TSA potently inhibited the proliferation of FL5.12 cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Bright-field microscopy of FL5.12 cells showed apoptotic morphology at 24 h after TSA treatment. Consistently, TSA treatment led to DNA fragmentation and increased the protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 and PARP as revealed by western blot analysis. To explore the underlying mechanism of TSA-induced apoptosis of FL5.12 cells, we further analyzed the hematopoietic transcription factor Purine Rich Box-1 (PU.1) by western blot analysis. TSA treatment resulted in the inhibition of PU.1 in FL5.12 cells. In contrast, apoptotic protein Bim was induced by TSA, which was inversely correlated with the survival of FL5.12 cells.

We tested the hypothesis that expression of ARID4B correlates with WHO grade and survival in patients with PBTs. METHODS: Western blot analysis was performed on protein lysates prepared from normal brain tissue and glioma cell lines (U87MG, LN229, GBM8401 and U118MG). Subsequently, immunohistochemical analysis of ARID4B was performed on 2 tissue microarrays, including 12 normal brain tissues, 63 meningiomas with different subtypes, 232 gliomas of various grades and degrees of differentiation, 8 central neurocytomas and 4 chordomas. The ARID4B immunostaining score was calculated by multiplying the intensity score by the percentage of tumour cells expressing ARID4B. RESULTS: In vitro, ARID4B protein expression was increased in some glioma cell lines. In addition, the average ARID4B immunostaining score was 38.03, 79.09, 129.76 and 119.32, respectively, in gliomas of WHO grade I, II, III and IV. Higher ARID4B immunostaining score was significantly correlated with more advanced WHO grade of gliomas (p=7.4x10(-6)) and meningiomas. Finally, higher ARID4B expression tended to the shorter survival rates, but did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: ARID4B overexpression presented in most of PBTs, rather than non-neoplastic brain tissue, and correlated with WHO grades in meningiomas and gliomas. Therefore, ARID4B is a satisfactory biomarker to highlight tumour component and predict tumour behaviour in primary brain neoplasms.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This family of proteins includes BRD2, BRD3, BRD4, and BRDT. BRD4 is the most-studied BET protein in cancer, and normally serves as an epigenetic reader that links active chromatin marks to transcriptional elongation through activation of RNA polymerase II. The role of BRD3 and BRD4 first became known in cancer as mutant oncoproteins fused to the p300-recruiting NUT protein in a rare aggressive subtype of squamous cell cancer known as NUT midline carcinoma (NMC). BET inhibitors are acetyl-histone mimetics that specifically bind BET bromodomains, competitively inhibiting its engagement with chromatin. The antineoplastic effects of BET inhibitors were first demonstrated in NMC and have since been shown to be effective at inhibiting the growth of many different cancers, particularly acute leukemia. BET inhibitors have also been instrumental as tool compounds that have demonstrated the key role of BRD4 in driving NMC and non-NMC cancer growth. Many clinical trials enrolling patients with hematologic and solid tumors are ongoing, with encouraging preliminary findings. BET proteins BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 are expressed in nearly all cells of the body, so there are concerns of toxicity with BET inhibitors, as well as the development of resistance. Toxicity and resistance may be overcome by combining BET inhibitors with other targeted inhibitors, or through the use of novel BET inhibitor derivatives.",['(c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The first-generation FLT3 inhibitors were developed several years ago and include midostaurin, lestaurtinib, sunitinib, and sorafenib. They are relatively nonspecific for FLT3, with other potential targets that include platelet-derived growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, KIT, and Janus kinase 2. The second-generation inhibitors, including quizartinib, crenolanib, PLX3397, and ASP2215, are more potent and selective than the first-generation inhibitors. The greater potency and selectivity promises greater efficacy in FLT3-mutated acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (particularly in patients with a greater allele burden) and less toxicity. A number of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied across virtually all disease settings, including frontline, relapsed and refractory, and maintenance, mainly in patients with FLT3-mutated AML. The future of FLT3 inhibitors in the treatment of AML, in combination with chemotherapy or stem cell transplant, appears bright.

An LC/MS/MS method was established for the simultaneous separation and quantification of individual sphingolipid species including ceramides, dihydroceramides, glucosylceramides, sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine and sphinganine-1-phosphate. All target individual sphingolipid species were separated and quantified in a single chromatographic run of <20min. Method validation results indicated that calibration curves were linear in the range of 2.5-10,000nM for ceramides and glucosylceramides, 10-10,000nM for dihydroceramides, 5-10,000nM for sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, sphinganine and sphinganine-1-phosphate, respectively.

Mean HCDR3 length is 25.5 amino acids (range 20-36), generated from inherently long DH and JH genes and extended regions of non-templated N-nucleotides. Long HCDR3 are suited to forming noncontiguous antigen contacts and to binding recessed, immunologically silent epitopes hidden from conventional antibodies, as seen with self-antigen crossreactive broadly neutralizing anti-HIV Ig (bnAb). The anti-alpha3(IV)NC1 collagen mAb also show preferential use of unmutated variable region genes that are enriched among human chronic lymphocytic leukemia antibodies that share features with natural polyreactive Ig. Our findings suggest unexpected relationships between pathogenic anti-collagen Ig, bnAb, and autoreactive Ig associated with malignancy, all of which arise from B cells expressing unconventional structural elements that may require transient escape from tolerance for successful expansion.",['Published by Elsevier Ltd.'],"['Foster, Mary H', 'Buckley, Elizabeth S', 'Chen, Benny J', 'Hwang, Kwan-Ki', 'Clark, Amy G']","['Foster MH', 'Buckley ES', 'Chen BJ', 'Hwang KK', 'Clark AG']",,"['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., USA; Durham VA Medical Center, Durham, N.C., USA; Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., USA.

Translocations and mutations along with multidrug resistance markers are important factors that determine therapeutic efficacy. Gene mutation profiling of patients at the time of diagnosis can offer accurate clinical decision-making. Multiplex PCR was used to screen for various translocations, mutations, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) status in pediatric ALL samples. The roles of P-gp were analyzed at the transcriptional and translational levels by using real-time PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. ALL specific cell line Jurkat was used to validate the functional role of P-gp in imparting drug resistance by siRNA knockdown studies. Co-occurrence of translocations and mutations contributes to cellular drug resistance. Presence of any translocation in addition to FLT3/ITD hints for overactive P-gp. Co-occurrence of E2A/PBX and TEL/AML has also been positively correlated with P-gp status. Multiplex PCR provides a rapid and cost effective technique for profiling translocations, mutations, and multidrug resistance status that determines what therapy patients could be administered.

However, its expression, function, and regulation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cases have yet to be demonstrated. Therefore, in the current study, we investigated the clinical significance and biologic effects of MSI2 expression in PDAC cases and sought to delineate the clinical significance of the newly identified Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4)/MSI2 regulatory pathway. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: MSI2 expression and its association with multiple clinicopathologic characteristics in human PDAC specimens were analyzed immunohistochemically. The biological functions of MSI2 regarding PDAC cell growth, migration, invasion, and metastasis were studied using gain- and loss-of-function assays both in vitro and in vivo Regulation of MSI2 expression by KLF4 was examined in several cancer cell lines, and the underlying mechanisms were studied using molecular biologic methods. RESULTS: MSI2 expression was markedly increased in both PDAC cell lines and human PDAC specimens, and high MSI2 expression was associated with poor prognosis for PDAC. Forced MSI2 expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and growth and metastasis in vivo, whereas knockdown of MSI2 expression did the opposite. Transcriptional inhibition of MSI2 expression by KLF4 occurred in multiple PDAC cell lines as well as mouse models of PDAC. CONCLUSIONS: Lost expression of KLF4, a transcriptional repressor of MSI2 results in overexpression of MSI2 in PDACs, which may be a biomarker for accurate prognosis. A dysregulated KLF4/MSI2 signaling pathway promotes PDAC progression and metastasis. Clin Cancer Res; 23(3); 687-96.

Approximately 15% of MPN cases do not carry mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are thus often referred to as triple-negative cases. These are caused by a diverse set of rare mutations in cytokine receptors, JAK-STAT signaling pathway components, or epigenetic modifiers. In addition, some cases diagnosed as MPN are reactive rather than clonal disorders, so a negative result from a genetic screen can be informative. To obtain a comprehensive rapid molecular diagnosis for most MPNs, we developed an assay to detect genetic mutations (single nucleotide variants and/or small insertions/deletions) in 86 genes using targeted exon resequencing (AmpliSeq) and a bench-top semiconductor machine (Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine). Our assay reliably detects well characterized mutations in JAK2, CALR, and MPL, but also rarer mutations in ASXL1, TET2, SH2B3, and other genes. Some of these mutations are novel. We find multiple mutations in advanced cases, suggesting co-operation between Janus kinase-STAT pathway mutations and epigenetic mutations in disease progression. This assay can be used to follow molecular progression, clonal heterogeneity, and drug resistance in MPNs.","['Copyright (c) 2016 American Society for Investigative Pathology and the', 'Association for Molecular Pathology.

Mutations of CBL, often genetically-inherited, are particularly common in Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML), a disease that manifests early in children. JMML is fatal unless corrected by bone marrow transplant, which is effective in only half of the recipients, stressing the need for animal models that recapitulate the key clinical features of this disease. However, mouse models established so far only develop hematological malignancy in adult animals. Here, using VAV1-Cre-induced conditional CBL/CBL-B double knockout (DKO) in mice, we established an animal model that exhibits a neonatal myeloproliferative disease (MPD). VAV1-Cre induced DKO mice developed a strong hematological phenotype at postnatal day 10, including severe leukocytosis and hepatomegaly, bone marrow cell hypersensitivity to cytokines including GM-CSF, and rapidly-progressive disease and invariable lethality. Interestingly, leukemic stem cells were most highly enriched in neonatal liver rather than bone marrow, which, along with the spleen and thymus, were hypo-cellular. Nonetheless, transplantation assays showed that both DKO bone marrow and liver cells can initiate leukemic disease in the recipient mice with seeding of both spleen and bone marrow. Together, our results support the usefulness of the new hematopoietic-specific CBL/CBL-B double KO animal model to study JMML-related pathogenesis and to further understand the function of CBL family proteins in regulating fetal and neonatal hematopoiesis.

Alteration of CRLF2 gene, a hallmark correlated with poor outcome in BCP-ALL, has not been reported in T-ALL.We analyzed CRLF2 expression in 212 T-ALL pediatric patients enrolled in AIEOP-BFM ALL2000 study in Italian and German centers.Seventeen out of 120 (14.2%) Italian patients presented CRLF2 mRNA expression 5 times higher than the median (CRLF2-high); they had a significantly inferior event-free survival (41.2%+/-11.9 vs. 68.9%+/-4.6, p=0.006) and overall survival (47.1%+/-12.1 vs. 73.8%+/-4.3, p=0.009) and an increased cumulative incidence of relapse/resistance (52.9%+/-12.1 vs. 26.2%+/-4.3, p=0.007) compared to CRLF2-low patients. The prognostic value of CRLF2 over-expression was validated in the German cohort. Of note, CRLF2 over-expression was associated with poor prognosis in the high risk (HR) subgroup where CRLF2-high patients were more frequently allocated.Interestingly, although in T-ALL CRLF2 protein was localized mainly in the cytoplasm, in CRLF2-high blasts we found a trend towards a stronger TSLP-induced pSTAT5 response, sensitive to the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib.In conclusion, CRLF2 over-expression is a poor prognostic marker identifying a subset of HR T-ALL patients that could benefit from alternative therapy, potentially targeting the CRLF2 pathway.",,"['Palmi, Chiara', 'Savino, Angela M', 'Silvestri, Daniela', 'Bronzini, Ilaria', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Paganin, Maddalena', 'Buldini, Barbara', 'Galbiati, Marta', 'Muckenthaler, Martina U', 'Bugarin, Cristina', 'Della Mina, Pamela', 'Nagel, Stefan', 'Barisone, Elena', 'Casale, Fiorina', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Lo Nigro, Luca', 'Micalizzi, Concetta', 'Parasole, Rosanna', 'Pession, Andrea', 'Putti, Maria C', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Testi, Anna M', 'Ziino, Ottavio', 'Kulozik, Andreas E', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Villa, Antonello', 'Gaipa, Giuseppe', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Valsecchi, Maria G', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Te Kronnie, Geertruy', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni']","['Palmi C', 'Savino AM', 'Silvestri D', 'Bronzini I', 'Cario G', 'Paganin M', 'Buldini B', 'Galbiati M', 'Muckenthaler MU', 'Bugarin C', 'Della Mina P', 'Nagel S', 'Barisone E', 'Casale F', 'Locatelli F', 'Lo Nigro L', 'Micalizzi C', 'Parasole R', 'Pession A', 'Putti MC', 'Santoro N', 'Testi AM', 'Ziino O', 'Kulozik AE', 'Zimmermann M', 'Schrappe M', 'Villa A', 'Gaipa G', 'Basso G', 'Biondi A', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Stanulla M', 'Conter V', 'Te Kronnie G', 'Cazzaniga G']",,"['Centro Ricerca M.

It causes antiproliferative effects through the inhibition of microtubule formation, which leads to mitotic arrest and cell death by apoptosis. Here, we report that a novel colchicine analog, 4o (N-[(7S)-1,2,3-trimethoxy-9-oxo-10-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-4-chlorophenylamino]-5,6, 7,9-tetrahydrobenzo[a]heptalen-7-yl]acetamide), which exhibited potent anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. In this study, 4o with excellent pharmacokinetic profile and no P-gp induction liability displayed strong inhibition of proliferation against various human cancer cell lines. However, pancreatic cancer cell line MIA PaCa-2 was found to be more sensitive towards 4o and showed strong inhibition in concentration and time-dependent manner. By increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, 4o induced endoplasmic reticular stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in MIA PaCa-2 cells. Blockage of ROS production reversed 4o-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, calcium release, and cell death. More importantly, it revealed that increased ROS generation might be an effective strategy in treating human pancreatic cancer. Further 4o treatment induced mitotic arrest, altered the expression of cell cycle-associated proteins, and disrupted the microtubules in MIA PaCa-2 cells. 4o treatment caused loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, and cleavage of caspase-3, thereby showing activation of mitochondrial mediated apoptosis. The in vivo anticancer activity of the compound was studied using sarcoma-180 (ascitic) and leukemia (P388 lymphocytic and L1210 lymphoid) models in mice and showed promising antitumor activity with the least toxicity unlike colchicine. Such studies have hitherto not been reported.

The inflammatory disorders associated to HTLV-1 are mediated by different proinflammatory cytokines as IL-1alpha, IL-6, TNF-alpha. The release and the role of IL-17 is still debated. Aims of this study were to analyze IL-17 induction by HTLV-1 infection and to determine whether resveratrol (RES) is able to down regulate the pathway of cytokines production either in HTLV-1 chronically infected MT-2 cell line or in human CD4+ cells infected in vitro with HTLV-1. METHODS: MT-2 and HTLV-1 infected CD4+ cells were analyzed for proinflammatory cytokine production before or after RES treatment. The concentrations of IL-17, IL-1alpha, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were measured in cell culture supernatants by ELISA and SearchLight technology. The IL-17 mRNA expression was evaluated by RT-PCR. NF-kB activation was detected by non-radioactive, Electro Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA). HTLV-1 RNA expression was detected by Real-time-PCR (RQ-PCR). RESULTS: We found that RES is capable of inducing a dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1alpha, IL-6 and TNF-alpha production in vitro and can down regulate the expression of IL-17 at both mRNA and protein levels in HTLV-1 infected cells. This effect was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of the of the nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kB) activity. Conversely, RES did not apparently affect HTLV-1 proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the anti-inflammatory properties of RES, suggesting that it might be a useful therapeutic agent for the treatment of HTLV-1 related inflammatory diseases.",,"['Fuggetta, Maria Pia', 'Bordignon, Valentina', 'Cottarelli, Andrea', 'Macchi, Beatrice', 'Frezza, Caterina', 'Cordiali-Fei, Paola', 'Ensoli, Fabrizio', 'Ciafre, Stefania', 'Marino-Merlo, Francesca', 'Mastino, Antonio', 'Ravagnan, Giampietro']","['Fuggetta MP', 'Bordignon V', 'Cottarelli A', 'Macchi B', 'Frezza C', 'Cordiali-Fei P', 'Ensoli F', 'Ciafre S', 'Marino-Merlo F', 'Mastino A', 'Ravagnan G']",,"['Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy. mariapia.fuggetta@ift.cnr.it.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute, Via Elio Chianesi, 53, 00144, Rome, Italy. valentina.bordignon@ifo.gov.it.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of System Medicine, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Via Montpellier 1, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemical Science and Surgery, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"", Via Montpellier 1, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute, Via Elio Chianesi, 53, 00144, Rome, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Pathology and Microbiology, San Gallicano Dermatologic Institute, Via Elio Chianesi, 53, 00144, Rome, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical, and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, 98166, Messina, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Chemical, Biological, Pharmaceutical, and Environmental Sciences, University of Messina, 98166, Messina, Italy.', 'Institute of Translational Pharmacology (IFT), National Research Council (CNR), Via Fosso del Cavaliere 100, 00133, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160722,England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (IL1A protein, human)', '0 (IL6 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-17)', '0 (Interleukin-1alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (TNF protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*virology', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-17/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism']",PMC4957876,2016/07/28 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2016/07/25 06:00'],"['2016/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-016-0398-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-016-0398-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2016 Jul 22;35(1):118. doi: 10.1186/s13046-016-0398-8.,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-1', '*Inflammatory cytokines', '*Resveratrol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary objectives were to compare the psychological well-being profile of CML patients with that of their peers in general population and to examine possible age- and sex-related differences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Analysis was performed on 417 patients in treatment with lifelong molecularly targeted therapies. Mean age of patients analyzed was 56 years (range 19-87 years) and 247 (59 %) were male and 170 (41 %) were female. Social support was assessed with the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and psychological well-being was evaluated with the short version of the Psychological General Well-Being Index. Descriptive statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used. RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that a greater social support was independently associated with lower anxiety and depression, as well as with higher positive well-being, self-control, and vitality (p < 0.001). Female patients reported statistically significant worse outcomes in all dimensions of psychological well-being. Age- and sex-adjusted comparisons with population norms revealed that depression (ES = -0.42, p < 0.001) and self-control (ES = -0.48, p < 0.001) were the two main impaired psychological dimensions.

We hypothesized that these side effects are influenced by glucocorticoid sensitivity at the tissue level. We therefore prospectively studied whether we could predict the occurrence of these side effects using the very low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (DST) or by measuring trough levels of dexamethasone. Fifty pediatric patients (3-16 years of age) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were initially included during the maintenance phase (with dexamethasone) of the Dutch ALL treatment protocol. As a marker of glucocorticoid sensitivity, the salivary very low-dose DST was used. A post-dexamethasone cortisol level <2.0nmol/L was considered a hypersensitive response. The neurobehavioral endpoints consisted of questionnaires regarding psychosocial and sleeping problems administered before and during the course of dexamethasone (6mg/m(2)), and dexamethasone trough levels were measured during dexamethasone treatment. Patients with a hypersensitive response to dexamethasone had more behavioral problems (N=11), sleeping problems, and/or somnolence (N=12) (P<0.05 for all three endpoints). The positive predictive values of the DST for psychosocial problems and sleeping problems were 50% and 30%, respectively. Dexamethasone levels were not associated with neurobehavioral side effects. We conclude that neither the very low-dose DST nor measuring dexamethasone trough levels can accurately predict dexamethasone-induced neurobehavioral side effects. However, patients with glucocorticoid hypersensitivity experienced significantly more symptoms associated with dexamethasone-induced depression. Future studies should elucidate further the mechanisms by which neurobehavioral side effects are influenced by glucocorticoid sensitivity.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Drosophila PREs are well characterized, whereas the existence of PREs in mammals remains debated. Accumulating evidence supports a model in which CpG islands recruit Polycomb group (PcG) complexes; however, which subset of CGIs is selected to serve as PREs is unclear. Trithorax (Trx) positively regulates gene expression in Drosophila and co-occupies PREs to antagonize Polycomb-dependent silencing. Here we demonstrate that Trx-dependent H3K4 dimethylation (H3K4me2) marks Drosophila PREs and maintains the developmental expression pattern of nearby genes. Similarly, the mammalian Trx homolog, MLL1, deposits H3K4me2 at CpG-dense regions that could serve as PREs. In the absence of MLL1 and H3K4me2, H3K27me3 levels, a mark of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), increase at these loci. By inhibiting PRC2-dependent H3K27me3 in the absence of MLL1, we can rescue expression of these loci, demonstrating a functional balance between MLL1 and PRC2 activities at these sites. Thus, our study provides rules for identifying cell-type-specific functional mammalian PREs within the human genome.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Mutually exclusive mutations in the RAS/ERK pathway genes such as PTPN11, NRAS, KRAS, CBL, or NF1 are found in ~90% of the cases. These mutations give rise to disease at least in part by activating STAT5 through phosphorylation and by promoting cell growth. MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression, which are often deregulated in leukemia. However, little is known about their role in JMML. Here, we report distinctive miR expression signatures associated with the molecular subgroups of JMML. Among the downregulated miRs in JMML, miR-150-5p was found to target STAT5b, a gene which is often over-activated in JMML, and contributes to the characteristic aberrant signaling of this disorder. Moreover, loss of miR-150-5p and upregulation of STAT5b expression were also identified in a murine model of JMML. Ectopic overexpression of miR-150-5p in mononuclear cells from three JMML patients significantly decreased cell proliferation. Altogether, our data indicate that miR expression is deregulated in JMML and may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder by modulating key effectors of cytokine receptor pathways.",,"['Leoncini, Pier Paolo', 'Bertaina, Alice', 'Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Flotho, Christian', 'Masetti, Riccardo', 'Bresolin, Silvia', 'Menna, Giuseppe', 'Santoro, Nicola', 'Zecca, Marco', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Nigita, Giovanni', 'Veneziano, Dario', 'Pagotto, Sara', ""D'Ovidio, Katia"", 'Rota, Rossella', 'Dorrance, Adrienne', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Garzon, Ramiro']","['Leoncini PP', 'Bertaina A', 'Papaioannou D', 'Flotho C', 'Masetti R', 'Bresolin S', 'Menna G', 'Santoro N', 'Zecca M', 'Basso G', 'Nigita G', 'Veneziano D', 'Pagotto S', ""D'Ovidio K"", 'Rota R', 'Dorrance A', 'Croce CM', 'Niemeyer C', 'Locatelli F', 'Garzon R']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy."", ""Department of Medical, Oral and Biotechnological Sciences, G. d'Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Arthur G.

METHODS: Childhood and adolescent leukaemia cases were drawn from the 11 Spanish population-based cancer registries. For survival, registries with data for the period 1991-2005 and follow-up until 31-12-2010 were included. Overall incidence trends were evaluated using joinpoint analysis. Observed survival rates were estimated using Kaplan-Meier, and trends were tested using the log-rank test. RESULTS: Based on 2606 cases (2274 children and 332 adolescents), the overall age-adjusted incidence rate (ASRw) of leukaemia was 47.9 cases per million child-years in children and 23.8 in adolescents. The ASRw of leukaemia increased with an annual percentage change of 9.6 % (95 % CI: 2.2-17.6) until 1990 followed by a stabilisation of rates. In adolescents, incidence did not increase. Five-year survival increased from 66 % in 1991-1995 to 76 % in 2001-2005. By age, survival was dramatically lower in infants (0) and adolescents (15-19) than in the other age groups and no improvement was observed. In both children and adolescents, differences in 5-year survival rates among major subgroups of leukaemias were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The increasing incidence trends observed in childhood leukaemias during the study period were confined to the beginning of the period. Remarkable improvements in survival have been observed in Spanish children with leukaemias.

Despite the clinical success of the first selective PI3Kdelta inhibitor, CAL-101, inhibition of PI3Kdelta itself did not show too much cytotoxic efficacy against cancer cells. One possible reason is that PI3Kdelta inhibition induced autophagy that protects the cells from death. Since class III PI3K isoform PIK3C3/Vps34 participates in autophagy initiation and progression, we predicted that a PI3Kdelta and Vps34 dual inhibitor might improve the anti-proliferative activity observed for PI3Kdelta-targeted inhibitors. We discovered a highly potent ATP-competitive PI3Kdelta/Vps34 dual inhibitor, PI3KD/V-IN-01, which displayed 10-1500 fold selectivity over other PI3K isoforms and did not inhibit any other kinases in the kinome. In cells, PI3KD/V-IN-01 showed 30-300 fold selectivity between PI3Kdelta and other class I PI3K isoforms. PI3KD/V-IN-01 exhibited better anti-proliferative activity against AML, CLL and Burkitt lymphoma cell lines than known selective PI3Kdelta and Vps34 inhibitors.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We performed an in vitro study involving MTT, flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and western blot analyses to investigate the effects of PCA treatment on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, and expression of several cell cycle-related genes in HT-29 cells. The treatment enhanced S-phase cell cycle and apoptosis in HT-29 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Western blot results showed that PCA treatment decreased the expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin D1, and p27(KIP1) but increased those of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) in HT-29 cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) and B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-xL (Bcl-xL) were down-regulated, whereas the levels of BH3-interacting domain death agonist (Bid), Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak), and cytosolic cytochrome c were significantly upregulated. Thus, the enzymes caspases-9, -3, -8, and -6 were found to be activated in HT-29 cells with PCA treatment.

Firstly, we detected that IK6 existed in 20 of 42 (47.6%) adult BCR-ABL1-positive B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL) by using reverse transcribed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nucleotide sequencing. IK6-positive patients had an unfavorable outcome compared with IK6-negative ones. Further study showed that the level of HO-1 expression was higher in IK6-positive patients' samples than that in IK6-negative ones. And there was a strong correlation between the expression of IK6 and HO-1. The growth of primary CD34+ leukemic cells derived from our IK6-positive patients' pool was prohibited by silencing HO-1, further promoting their apoptosis. Furthermore, primary CD34+ leukemic cells derived from IK6-positive patients shown poor responses to imatinib in comparison with wild-type (IK1) patients, suggesting that the expression of IK6 resisted to imatinib in adult BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL. Importantly, inhibition of HO-1 also increased their sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Finally, we found that IK6 activated downstream STAT5, and HO-1 was one of the downstream target genes of STAT5. In conclusion, HO-1 is an essential survival factor in BCR-ABL1-positive B-ALL with IK6, and targeting HO-1 can attenuate the negative impact of IK6.",,"['Lin, Xiaojing', 'Zou, Xingli', 'Wang, Ziming', 'Fang, Qin', 'Chen, Shuya', 'Huang, Jun', 'Zhe, Nana', 'Yu, Meisheng', 'Zhang, Yaming', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Lin X', 'Zou X', 'Wang Z', 'Fang Q', 'Chen S', 'Huang J', 'Zhe N', 'Yu M', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang J']",,"['Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College, Nanchong 637000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Clinical Medicine, Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Guizhou Provincial Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, Guiyang 550004, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Ikaros 6 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Young Adult']",PMC5288214,2016/07/23 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2015/09/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10725 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10725 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):53679-53701. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10725.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1-positive', 'IKZF1', 'STAT5', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'heme oxygenase-1']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in particular, controversial new findings indicate that HIF-1alpha can act either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene, and this may depend on the stage of leukemia development and/or the AML sub-type.In this study, we find that HIF-1alpha promotes leukemia progression in the acute monocytic leukemia sub-type of AML through activation of an invasive phenotype. By applying a list of validated HIF-1alpha-target genes to different AML sub-types, we identified a HIF-1alpha signature that typifies acute monocytic leukemia when compared with all other AML sub-types. We validated expression of this signature in cell lines and primary cells from AML patients. Interestingly, this signature is enriched for genes that control cell motility at different levels. As a consequence, inhibiting HIF-1alpha impaired leukemia cell migration, chemotaxis, invasion and transendothelial migration in vitro, and this resulted in impaired bone marrow homing and leukemia progression in vivo. Our data suggest that in acute monocytic leukemia an active HIF-1alpha-dependent pro-invasive pathway mediates the ability of leukemic cells to migrate and invade extramedullary sites and may be targeted to reduce leukemia dissemination.",,"['Migliavacca, Jessica', 'Percio, Stefano', 'Valsecchi, Roberta', 'Ferrero, Elisabetta', 'Spinelli, Antonello', 'Ponzoni, Maurilio', 'Tresoldi, Cristina', 'Pattini, Linda', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Coltella, Nadia']","['Migliavacca J', 'Percio S', 'Valsecchi R', 'Ferrero E', 'Spinelli A', 'Ponzoni M', 'Tresoldi C', 'Pattini L', 'Bernardi R', 'Coltella N']",,"['Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University School of Medicine, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical, Metabolic and Neural Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Modena, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Imaging Center, Preclinical Imaging Facility, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Vita-Salute San Raffaele University School of Medicine, Milan, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, IRCCS, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Oncology, IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype']",PMC5288204,2016/07/23 06:00,2018/01/31 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10660 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10660 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):53540-53557. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10660.,['NOTNLM'],"['HIF-1alpha', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'invasion', 'motility', 'self-renewal']",,"['The authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest in relation to the', 'submitted work.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wide interindividual variations in drug disposition warrant frequent doses adjustments, but there is a lack of international consensus on dose adjustment guidelines. PROCEDURE: To identify relapse predictors, we collected 28,255 data sets on drug doses and blood counts (median: 47/patient) and analyzed erythrocyte (Ery) levels of cytotoxic 6MP/MTX metabolites in 9,182 blood samples (median: 14 samples/patient) from 532 children on MTX/6MP maintenance therapy targeted to a white blood cell count (WBC) of 1.5-3.5 x 10(9) /l. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 13.8 years for patients in remission, stepwise Cox regression analysis did not find age, average doses of 6MP and MTX, hemoglobin, absolute lymphocyte counts, thrombocyte counts, or Ery levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides or MTX (including its polyglutamates) to be significant relapse predictors. The parameters significantly associated with risk of relapse (N = 83) were male sex (hazard ratio [HR] 2.0 [1.3-3.1], P = 0.003), WBC at diagnosis (HR = 1.04 per 10 x 10(9) /l rise [1.00-1.09], P = 0.048), the absolute neutrophil count (ANC; HR = 1.7 per 10(9) /l rise [1.3-2.4], P = 0.0007), and Ery thiopurine methyltransferase activity (HR = 2.7 per IU/ml rise [1.1-6.7], P = 0.03).

Initial clinical trials of this drug class focused on bortezomib, a reversible inhibitor of the 20S proteasome, with promising results for the treatment of adult hematologic malignancies, including multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. AREAS COVERED: This article will review the use of bortezomib and other proteasome inhibitors in both adult and pediatric populations, with a focus on their use in pediatrics. Expert commentary: Bortezomib moved into the pediatric oncology arena with encouraging results in multiple early phase trials for relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. Bortezomib is also being studied in the treatment of non-malignant disorders, including antibody-mediated allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, and autoimmune cytopenias.

PROCEDURE: In a Nordic/Baltic prospective study, we assessed centralized flow cytometry (FCM) of locally fixed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples versus local conventional cytospin-based cytology (CC) for detecting leukemic cells and evaluating kinetics of elimination of leukemic cells in CSF. RESULTS: Among 300 patients with newly diagnosed ALL, 87 (29%) had CSF involvement by FCM, while CC was positive in 30 (10%) of 299 patients with available CC data (P < 0.001). Patients with FCM+/CC+ had higher CSF leukemic blast counts compared to patients positive by FCM only (medians: 0.10 vs. 0.017 leukemic blasts/mul, P = 0.006). Patients positive by FCM had higher white blood cell counts in peripheral blood than patients negative by FCM (medians: 45 x 10(9) /l vs. 10 x 10(9) /l, P < 0.001), were younger (medians: 3 years vs. 4 years, P = 0.03), and more frequently had T-cell ALL (18/87 vs. 16/213, P = 0.001). At treatment day 15, five of 52 patients (10%) who had CSF positive by FCM at diagnosis remained so despite at least two doses of weekly intrathecal chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Longer follow-up is needed to clarify whether FCM positivity has prognostic significance and is an indicator for intensified CNS-directed therapy.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Levinsen, Mette', 'Marquart, Hanne V', 'Groth-Pedersen, Line', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Albertsen, Birgitte K', 'Andersen, Mette K', 'Frandsen, Thomas L', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Pronk, Cornelis', 'Ulvmoen, Aina', 'Vaitkeviciene, Goda', 'Lahteenmaki, Paivi M', 'Niinimaki, Riitta', 'Taskinen, Mervi', 'Jeppesen, Maria', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Levinsen M', 'Marquart HV', 'Groth-Pedersen L', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Albertsen BK', 'Andersen MK', 'Frandsen TL', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Pronk C', 'Ulvmoen A', 'Vaitkeviciene G', 'Lahteenmaki PM', 'Niinimaki R', 'Taskinen M', 'Jeppesen M', 'Schmiegelow K']",,"['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Institution of Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Astrid Lindgrens Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oslo University Hospital, Norway.', ""Centre for Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University Children's Hospital, Vilnius, Lithuania."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland.', 'Children and Adolescents, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Perlmutter Cancer Center, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York. kschmiegelow@rh.dk.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160722,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blast Crisis/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/cerebrospinal fluid/*pathology']",,2016/07/23 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26128 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1935-42. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26128.

Clinical and genetic features incompletely predict outcome. The value of clinical epigenetic assays for risk classification has not been extensively explored. We assess the prognostic implications of a clinical assay for multilocus DNA methylation on adult patients with de novo AML. METHODS: We performed multilocus DNA methylation assessment using xMELP on samples and calculated a methylation statistic (M-score) for 166 patients from UPENN with de novo AML who received induction chemotherapy. The association of M-score with complete remission (CR) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated. The optimal M-score cut-point for identifying groups with differing survival was used to define a binary M-score classifier. This classifier was validated in an independent cohort of 383 patients from the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial 1900 (E1900; NCT00049517). RESULTS: A higher mean M-score was associated with death and failure to achieve CR. Multivariable analysis confirmed that a higher M-score was associated with death (P = 0.011) and failure to achieve CR (P = 0.034). Median survival was 26.6 months versus 10.6 months for low and high M-score groups. The ability of the M-score to perform as a classifier was confirmed in patients </= 60 years with intermediate cytogenetics and patients who achieved CR, as well as in the E1900 validation cohort. CONCLUSION: The M-score represents a valid binary prognostic classifier for patients with de novo AML. The xMELP assay and associated M-score can be used for prognosis and should be further investigated for clinical decision making in AML patients.",,"['Luskin, Marlise R', 'Gimotty, Phyllis A', 'Smith, Catherine', 'Loren, Alison W', 'Figueroa, Maria E', 'Harrison, Jenna', 'Sun, Zhuoxin', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Paietta, Elisabeth M', 'Litzow, Mark R', 'Melnick, Ari M', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Fernandez, Hugo F', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Carroll, Martin', 'Master, Stephen R', 'Wertheim, Gerald B W']","['Luskin MR', 'Gimotty PA', 'Smith C', 'Loren AW', 'Figueroa ME', 'Harrison J', 'Sun Z', 'Tallman MS', 'Paietta EM', 'Litzow MR', 'Melnick AM', 'Levine RL', 'Fernandez HF', 'Luger SM', 'Carroll M', 'Master SR', 'Wertheim GB']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Montefiore Medical Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.', 'Hematology and Oncology Division, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Moffit Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN), Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Philadelphia Veterans Administration Medical Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.""]",['eng'],"['I01 BX000918/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000003/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA185365/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,,,,PMC4951094,2016/07/23 06:00,2016/07/23 06:01,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/23 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1172/jci.insight.87323 [doi]'],ppublish,JCI Insight. 2016 Jun 16;1(9). doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.87323.,,,['NIHMS796448'],,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00049517'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In these models, following intravenous injection, leukemic cells home to the bone marrow and proliferate there before infiltrating other organs, such as spleen, liver, and the central nervous system. Moreover, such models have been shown to accurately recapitulate the human disease and correlate with patient response to therapy and prognosis. Thus, various immune-deficient mice strains have been used with or without recipient preconditioning to increase engraftment efficiency. Mice homozygous for the severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mutation and with non-obese diabetic background (NOD/SCID) have been used in the majority of leukemia xenograft studies. Later, NOD/SCID mice deficient for interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain (IL2Rgamma) gene called NSG mice became the model of choice for leukemia xenografts. However, engraftment of leukemia cells without irradiation preconditioning still remained a challenge. In this study, we used NSG mice with null alleles for major histocompatibility complex class I beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) called NSG-B2m. This is a first report describing the 100% engraftment efficiency of pediatric leukemia cell lines and primary samples in NSG-B2m mice in the absence of host preconditioning by sublethal irradiation. We also show direct comparison of the engraftment efficiency and growth rate of pediatric acute leukemia cells in NSG-B2m and NOD/SCID mice, which showed 80-90% engraftment efficiency. Secondary and tertiary xenografts in NSG-B2m mice generated by injection of cells isolated from the spleens of leukemia-bearing mice also behaved similar to the primary patient sample. We have successfully engrafted 25 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 5 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples with distinct cytogenetic characteristics in NSG-B2m mice, with the purpose of generating pediatric ALL and AML xenografts for preclinical evaluation of drugs. Thus, our data support the use of NSG-B2m mouse model for leukemia engraftment and in vivo preclinical drug efficacy studies.",,"['Gopalakrishnapillai, Anilkumar', 'Kolb, E Anders', 'Dhanan, Priyanka', 'Bojja, Aruna Sri', 'Mason, Robert W', 'Corao, Diana', 'Barwe, Sonali P']","['Gopalakrishnapillai A', 'Kolb EA', 'Dhanan P', 'Bojja AS', 'Mason RW', 'Corao D', 'Barwe SP']",,"['Nemours Center for Childhood Cancer Research, A.I.

Consequently, they have been described using multiple nomenclatures including Fc receptor homologs (FcRH), immunoglobulin superfamily receptor translocation-associated genes (IRTA), immunoglobulin-Fc-gp42-related genes (IFGP), Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase anchor proteins (SPAP), and B cell cross-linked by anti-immunoglobulin M-activating sequences (BXMAS). They are now referred to under a unified nomenclature as FCRL. Eight different human FCRL genes have been identified, all of which appear to be related to the genes of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) of cellular adhesion molecules. These type 1 transmembrane glycoproteins are composed of different combinations of 5 types of immunoglobulin-like domains, with each protein consisting of 3 to 9 domains, and no individual domain type conserved throughout all of the FCRL proteins. Ligands for the majority of the FCRLs remain unknown. In general, FCRL expression is restricted to lymphocytes and is primarily expressed in B-lymphocytes, supporting FCRL's involvement in a variety of immune disorders. Most FCRLs functionally repress B-cell activation; however, they might have dual roles in lymphocyte functions as these proteins often possess immunoreceptor tyrosine activation (ITAM) and inhibitory (ITIM) motif elements.

In HL-60 cells that were treated with chemotherapy drugs combined with a caspase-10 inhibitor, the rate of survival decreased significantly compared with HL-60 cells treated with chemotherapy drugs alone. In contrast, the rate of survival of Jurkat cells treated with chemotherapy drugs combined with the caspase-10 inhibitor increased significantly compared with Jurkat cells treated with chemotherapy drugs alone. The results of the flow cytometry and western blotting showed that the changes in the survival rate may be caused by a change in the amount of apoptosis occurring in the Jurkat cells treated with chemotherapy drugs combined with the caspase-10 inhibitor. However, in HL-60 cells undergoing this combination treatment, the change in the survival rate was not caused by a change in the rate of apoptosis. When HL-60 cells were treated with the chemotherapy drugs combined with the caspase-10 inhibitor and the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyl adenine, the survival rate increased, whereas the rate of apoptosis did not change.

The present study aimed to further analyze the effects of cell-cell interaction between macrophages and ATLL cells by means of cell culture studies and immunohistochemical analysis using human ATLL samples. It was found that direct co-culture with macrophages induced chemoresistance in the ATLL ATN-1 cell line, but not in other cell lines, including TL-Mor, ED and ATL-2S. It was also found that expression of the T cell Ig and mucin domain-containing molecule-3 (TIM-3) was induced in ATN-1 cells by their long-term co-culture with macrophages. TIM-3 gene transfection induced chemoresistance in the ATN-1 cells. Immunostaining of ATLL tissues showed TIM-3 expression in 25 out of 58 ATLL cases.

It was observed that overexpression of IK1 could enhance DOX-induced apoptosis, while knockdown of IK1 attenuated DOX-induced apoptosis in leukemic cells.

Less than one-third of adult patients with leukemia are managed using current therapies due to the emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR), emphasizing the need for newer and more robust approaches. Recent reports have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to selective gene expression and, hence, could be manipulated effectively to halt the progression of cancer. However, little is known regarding the role of lncRNA in leukemia. Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1) is a nuclear-restricted lncRNA involved in the pathogenesis of certain types of cancer. Deregulated expression of NEAT1 has been reported in a number of human malignancies, including leukemia and other solid tumors. The present study aimed to characterize the role of NEAT1 in the regulation of MDR in leukemia. Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that NEAT1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels were significantly downregulated in leukemia patient samples compared with those from healthy donors. Furthermore, NEAT1 mRNA expression was repressed in a number of leukemia cell lines, including K562, THP-1, HL-60 and Jurkat cells, compared with peripheral white blood control cells, consistent with the expression observed in patients with leukemia. In addition, the transfection of a NEAT1 overexpression plasmid into K562 and THP-1 leukemia cell lines alleviated MDR induced by cytotoxic agents, such as Alisertib and Bortezomib, through inhibition of ATP-binding cassette G2. Although more robust studies are warranted, the current findings provide the basis for the use of NEAT1 as a novel promising target in the treatment of leukemia.",,"['Gao, Caihua', 'Zhang, Jianying', 'Wang, Qingyan', 'Ren, Chunhua']","['Gao C', 'Zhang J', 'Wang Q', 'Ren C']",,"['Department of Medical Services, Weihai Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Weihai, Shandong 264200, P.R.

Several risk factors for ON have been identified in childhood cancer patients; however, their diagnostic and prognostic power is limited and the etiology of the disease remains unclear. Therefore, a continuous effort is focused on the identification of additional ON risk factors. We performed a retrospective study of 313 childhood ALL patients to test the association between the ON occurrence in children receiving ALL therapy and common polymorphisms in potential target genes: Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT; 460G>A, 719A>G), 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR; 677C>T, 1298A>C), estrogen receptor alpha 1 (ESR1; XbaI) and collagen type I, alpha1 (COL1A1; Sp1). In the present cohort, higher age and more recently developed treatment protocols were independent risk factors for ON. In children >14.5 years old, TPMT genotype modulated the risk of ON. Additionally, in children <12.9 years old ESR1 genotypes were also implicated in the pathogenesis of ON. Besides greater age and more recent treatment protocols, genetic factors (polymorphisms in ESR1 and TPMT genes) were suggested to be implicated in the pathogenesis of ON and could be potentially used as genetic prognostic markers for ON.",,"['Karas-Kuzelicki, Natasa', 'Mencej-Bedrac, Simona', 'Jazbec, Janez', 'Marc, Janja', 'Mlinaric-Rascan, Irena']","['Karas-Kuzelicki N', 'Mencej-Bedrac S', 'Jazbec J', 'Marc J', 'Mlinaric-Rascan I']",,"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', ""Unit of Oncology and Hematology, University Medical Centre, University Children's Hospital, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia."", 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160525,Greece,Exp Ther Med,Experimental and therapeutic medicine,101531947,,,,PMC4950129,2016/07/23 06:00,2016/07/23 06:01,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2015/07/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/etm.2016.3391 [doi]', 'ETM-0-0-3391 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Ther Med. 2016 Aug;12(2):840-846. doi: 10.3892/etm.2016.3391.

We analyzed the behavior of public microarray data sets from Ewing sarcoma (""Ewing family tumors,"" EFT) cell lines and biopsies in GEMusicA after prefiltering DNA microarray data for the probe sets from the stem cell signature. Our results demonstrate that individual Ewing sarcoma cell lines have a high similarity to ESC or EC. Ewing sarcoma cell lines with inhibited Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1-Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (EWSR1-FLI1) oncogene retained the similarity to ESC and EC. However, correlation coefficients between GEMusicA-processed expression data between EFT and ESC decreased whereas correlation coefficients between EFT and EC as well as between EFT and MSC increased after knockdown of EWSR1-FLI1.

Based on literature review, there has been an increase in reported incidents of pulmonary talcosis due to various forms of exposure to the mineral. We report an 82-year-old man who is diagnosed with Philadelphia chromosome positive pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with palliative imatinib who presented with chronic hemoptysis and dyspnea shortly after his diagnosis. His symptoms were initially thought to be due to an infectious etiology due to his malignancy, immunocompromised state, and radiographic findings until high-resolution computerized tomographic (HRCT) findings showed a diffuse pulmonary fibrosis picture that prompted further questioning and a more thorough history inquiry on his exposure to causative agents of interstitial lung disease. Very often, patients do not recognize their exposure, especially in those whose exposure is unrelated to their occupation.

Patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) often require intensive care unit (ICU) admission due to organ failure through disease progression or treatment-related complications. Objective. To determine mortality and prognostic variables in adult patients with HM who were admitted to ICU. Methods. Structured chart review of all adult patients (age >/= 18 years) with HM admitted to ICU of a Canadian tertiary care hospital between 2004 and 2014. Outcome measures included mortality (ICU, 30-day, 60-day, and 12-month). Logistic regression was performed to determine predictors of mortality. Results. Overall, there were 206 cases of HM admitted to the ICU during the study (mean age: 51.3 +/- 13.6 years; 60% male). Median stay was 3 days, with 14.1% requiring prolonged ICU admission. ICU mortality was 45.6% and increased to 59.2% at 30 days, 62.6% at 60 days, and 74.3% at 12 months. Predictors of increased ICU mortality included mechanical ventilation requirement and vasopressor therapy requirement, while admission to ICU postoperatively and having myeloma were associated with decreased mortality. Conclusions. Patients admitted to ICU with HM have high mortality (45.6%), which increased to 74.3% at 1 year.

The objectives were to describe the management and outcomes of acute leukemia (AL) patients admitted to the ICU and to identify predictors of ICU mortality. Methods. Data was retrospectively collected from the medical records of all patients with AML or ALL admitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital ICU from August 2009 to December 2012. Results. 151 AL patients (117 AML, 34 ALL) were admitted to the ICU. Mean age was 54 (SD 15) years, median APACHE II score was 27 (IQR 22-33), and 50% were female. While in ICU, 128 (85%) patients had sepsis and 56 (37%) had ARDS. The majority of patients required invasive organ support: 94 (62%) required mechanical ventilation while 23 (15%) received renal replacement therapy. Multivariable analysis identified SOFA score (OR 1.18, 95% CI 1.01-1.38) and invasive ventilation (OR 9.64, 95% CI 3.39-27.4) as independent predictors of ICU mortality. Ninety-four (62%) patients survived to ICU discharge. Only 39% of these 94 patients discharged were alive 12 months after ICU admission. Conclusions. AL patients admitted to the ICU had a 62% ICU survival rate; yet only 25% of cohort patients were alive 12 months after ICU admission. Higher admission SOFA scores and invasive ventilation are independently associated with a greater risk of dying in the ICU.",,"['Kraguljac, Alan P', 'Croucher, Danielle', 'Christian, Michael', 'Ibrahimova, Narmin', 'Kumar, Vikram', 'Jacob, Gabriella', 'Kiss, Alex', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Mehta, Sangeeta']","['Kraguljac AP', 'Croucher D', 'Christian M', 'Ibrahimova N', 'Kumar V', 'Jacob G', 'Kiss A', 'Minden MD', 'Mehta S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7948-093X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9089-8816', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7073-4769']","['Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5; Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8.', 'Division of Medical Oncology & Haematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 2M9.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5.', 'Department of Research Design and Biostatistics, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada M4N 3M5.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8; Division of Medical Oncology & Haematology, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 2M9.', 'Department of Medicine & Interdepartmental Division of Critical Care, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada M5G 1X5; Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada M5S 1A8.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160630,Egypt,Can Respir J,Canadian respiratory journal,9433332,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC4944052,2016/07/23 06:00,2017/07/06 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/03/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/3027656 [doi]'],ppublish,Can Respir J. 2016;2016:3027656. doi: 10.1155/2016/3027656.

The current study demonstrates that three driver mutations were detected in 82.6% of 407 MPNs with a mutation distribution of JAK2 in 275 (67.6%), CALR in 55 (13.5%) and MPL in 6 (1.5%). The mutations were mutually exclusive in principle except in one patient with both CALR and MPL mutations. The driver mutation directed the pathologic features of MPNs, including lineage hyperplasia, laboratory findings and clinical presentation. JAK2-mutated MPN showed erythroid, granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia whereas CALR- and MPL-mutated MPNs displayed granulocytic and/or megakaryocytic hyperplasia. The lineage hyperplasia was closely associated with a higher mutant allele burden and peripheral cytosis. These findings corroborated that the lineage hyperplasia consisted of clonal proliferation of each hematopoietic lineage acquiring driver mutations. Our study has also demonstrated that bone marrow (BM) fibrosis was associated with disease progression. Patients with overt fibrosis (grade 2) presented an increased mutant allele burden (P<0.001), an increase in chromosomal abnormalities (P<0.001) and a poor prognosis (P<0.001). Moreover, among patients with overt fibrosis, all patients with wild-type JAK2/CALR/MPL (triple-negative) showed genomic alterations by genome-wide microarray study and revealed the poorest overall survival, followed by JAK2-mutated MPNs. The genetic-pathologic characteristics provided the information for understanding disease pathogenesis and the progression of MPNs. The prognostic significance of the driver mutation and BM fibrosis suggests the necessity of a prospective therapeutic strategy to improve the clinical outcome.",,"['Kim, Yonggoo', 'Park, Joonhong',

Delphinidin and cyanidin are two major anthocyanins of the roselle plant (Hibiscus sabdariffa). In the present study, we investigated the effect of Hibiscus anthocyanins (HAs) on cell cycle arrest in human leukemia cell line HL-60 and the analyzed the underlying molecular mechanisms. HAs extracted from roselle calyces (purity 90%) markedly induced G2/M arrest evaluated with flow cytometry analysis. Western blot analyses revealed that HAs (0.1-0.7 mg mL(-1) ) induced G2/M arrest via increasing Tyr15 phosphorylation of Cdc2, and inducing Cdk inhibitors p27 and p21. HAs also induced phosphorylation of upstream signals related to G2/M arrest such as phosphorylation of Cdc25C tyrosine phosphatase at Ser216, increasing the binding of pCdc25C with 14-3-3 protein. HAs-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C could be activated by ATM checkpoint kinases, Chk1, and Chk2. We first time confirmed that ATM-Chk1/2-Cdc25C pathway as a critical mechanism for G2/M arrest in HAs-induced leukemia cell cycle arrest, indicating that this compound could be a promising anticancer candidate or chemopreventive agents for further investigation.

BCL2 knockdown in cells rendered remarkable resistance to Disarib, while sensitivity was regained upon its ectopic expression, establishing target specificity. In silico, biochemical and biophysical studies demonstrated strong affinity of Disarib to BCL2, but not to other antiapoptotic BCL2 family members viz., BCL-xL, BCL2A1 etc. Interestingly, biophysical studies showed that BH1 domain deletion mutant demonstrated ~ 67-fold reduction in BCL2-Disarib interaction, while it was only ~ 20-fold in the case of BH3 deletion mutant, suggesting predominant involvement of the BH1 domain for Disarib binding.

Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, is particularly rare in the DS population, with only one published case. As demonstrated in a mouse model, DS is associated with cerebellar hypoplasia and a decreased number of cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells (CGNPs) in the external granule cell layer (EGL). Treatment of these mice with sonic hedgehog signaling pathway (Shh) agonists promote normalization of CGNPs and improved cognitive functioning. CASE REPORT: We describe a 21-month-old male with DS and concurrent desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma (DNMB)-a tumor derived from Shh dysregulation and over-activation of CGNPs. Molecular profiling further classified the tumor into the new consensus SHH molecular subgroup. Additional testing revealed a de novo heterozygous germ line mutation in the PTCH1 gene encoding a tumor suppressor protein in the Shh pathway. DISCUSSION: The developmental failure of CGNPs in DS patients offers a plausible explanation for the rarity of medulloblastoma in this population. Conversely, patients with PTCH1 germline mutations experience Shh overstimulation resulting in Gorlin (Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma) syndrome and an increased incidence of malignant transformation of CGNPs leading to medulloblastoma formation. This represents the first documented report of an individual with DS simultaneously carrying PTCH1 germline mutation. CONCLUSION: We have observed a highly unusual circumstance in which the PTCH1 mutation appears to ""trump"" the effects of DS in causation of Shh-activated medulloblastoma.",,"['Mangum, Ross', 'Varga, Elizabeth', 'Boue, Daniel R', 'Capper, David', 'Benesch, Martin', 'Leonard, Jeffrey', 'Osorio, Diana S', 'Pierson, Christopher R', 'Zumberge, Nicholas', 'Sahm, Felix', 'Schrimpf, Daniel', 'Pfister, Stefan M', 'Finlay, Jonathan L']","['Mangum R', 'Varga E', 'Boue DR', 'Capper D', 'Benesch M', 'Leonard J', 'Osorio DS', 'Pierson CR', 'Zumberge N', 'Sahm F', 'Schrimpf D', 'Pfister SM', 'Finlay JL']",,"[""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA. ross.mangum@nationwidechildrens.org."", ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Core Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical University of Graz, Graz, Austria.', ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA."", 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Core Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Core Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Neuropathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Core Center Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Pediatric Neurooncology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""The Divisions of Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, the Departments of Pediatrics, Surgery and Pathology, Nationwide Children's Hospital and The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.""]",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160721,Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,"['0 (PTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Patched-1 Receptor)']",IM,"['Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/complications/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Medulloblastoma/complications/*genetics', 'Patched-1 Receptor/*genetics']",,2016/07/23 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00381-016-3185-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s00381-016-3185-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2016 Dec;32(12):2439-2446. doi: 10.1007/s00381-016-3185-0.

CML patients exhibiting TKI resistance are at greater risk of developing an aggressive and drug-insensitive disease. Drug-resistant CML typically arises in response to spontaneous mutations within the drug binding sites of the targeted oncoproteins. To better understand the mechanism of drug resistance in TKI-resistant CML patients, the BCR-ABL transformed cell line KCL22 was grown with increasing concentrations of imatinib for a period of 6 weeks. Subsequently, a drug-resistant derivative of the parental KCL22 cell line harboring the T315I gatekeeper mutation was isolated and investigated for TKI drug sensitivity via multi-agent drug screens. A synergistic combination of ponatinib- and forskolin-reduced cell viability was identified in this clinically relevant imatinib-resistant CML cell line, which also proved efficacious in other CML cell lines. In summary, this study provides new insight into the biological underpinnings of BCR-ABL-driven CML and potential rationale for investigating novel treatment strategies for patients with T315I CML.",,"['Oaxaca, Derrick M', 'Yang-Reid, Sun Ah', 'Ross, Jeremy A', 'Rodriguez, Georgialina', 'Staniswalis, Joan G', 'Kirken, Robert A']","['Oaxaca DM', 'Yang-Reid SA', 'Ross JA', 'Rodriguez G', 'Staniswalis JG', 'Kirken RA']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 W.

We reviewed 77 de novo acute erythroleukemia and 279 de novo refractory anemia with excess blasts from three large medical centers. Compared to refractory anemia with excess blasts, acute erythroleukemia patients had higher total bone marrow blasts, lower platelets, hemoglobin, and absolute neutrophil counts, with more patients being assigned a very-poor-karyotype risk and very-high Revised International Prognostic Scoring System score. Induction chemotherapy was administered to 55% of acute erythroleukemia patients, but was not associated with longer overall survival compared to acute erythroleukemia patients treated with lower-intensity therapies or supportive care (P=0.44). In multivariable analysis of all patients, Revised International Prognostic Scoring System very high (P<0.0001) or high (P=0.005) risk, but not a diagnosis of acute erythroleukemia (P=0.30), were independent risk factors for shorter overall survival. Our data show that acute erythroleukemia patients have similar risk-adjusted outcome to refractory anemia with excess blasts patients and do not appear to gain survival advantage with acute myeloid leukemia-type induction chemotherapy.

The persistence and dynamic clonal evolution of leukemia-initiating cells and preleukemic stem cells during disease progression and treatment are thought to contribute to disease relapse and poor outcome. Inv(16)(p13q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22), one of the most common cytogenetic abnormalities in AML, leads to expression of a fusion protein CBFbeta-SMMHC (CM) known to disrupt myeloid and lymphoid differentiation. Anemia is often observed in AML but is presumed to be a secondary consequence of leukemic clonal expansion. Here, we show that CM expression induces marked deficiencies in erythroid lineage differentiation and early preleukemic expansion of a phenotypic pre-megakaryocyte/erythrocyte (Pre-Meg/E) progenitor population. Using dual-fluorescence reporter mice in lineage tracking and repopulation assays, we show that CM expression cell autonomously causes expansion of abnormal Pre-Meg/E progenitors with compromised erythroid specification and differentiation capacity. The preleukemic Pre-Meg/Es display dysregulated erythroid and megakaryocytic fate-determining factors including increased Spi-1, Gata2, and Gfi1b and reduced Zfpm1, Pf4, Vwf, and Mpl expression. Furthermore, these abnormal preleukemic Pre-Meg/Es have enhanced stress resistance and are prone to leukemia initiation upon acquiring cooperative signals. This study reveals that the leukemogenic CM fusion protein disrupts adult erythropoiesis and creates stress-resistant preleukemic Pre-Meg/E progenitors predisposed to malignant transformation. Abnormality in Meg/E or erythroid progenitors could potentially be considered an early predictive risk factor for leukemia evolution.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Cai, Qi', 'Jeannet, Robin', 'Hua, Wei-Kai', 'Cook, Guerry J', 'Zhang, Bin', 'Qi, Jing', 'Liu, Hongjun', 'Li, Ling', 'Chen, Ching-Cheng', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Kuo, Ya-Huei']","['Cai Q', 'Jeannet R', 'Hua WK', 'Cook GJ', 'Zhang B', 'Qi J', 'Liu H', 'Li L', 'Chen CC', 'Marcucci G', 'Kuo YH']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2595-0419'],"['Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178387/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160721,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocyte-Erythroid Progenitor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC5025900,2016/07/23 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34140-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-01-693119 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 15;128(11):1503-15. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-01-693119.

B-cell receptor responsiveness in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells is heterogeneous among patients and correlates with aggressiveness of the disease. Here we show, for the first time, that SLP76, a key scaffold protein in T-cell receptor signaling, is ectopically expressed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, with variable levels among patients, and correlates positively with unmutated immunoglobulin heavy chain variable gene status and ZAP-70 expression. We found that SLP76 was functionally active in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. A SYK-dependent basal level of phosphorylated SLP76 exists in the cells, and upon B-cell receptor engagement, SLP76 tyrosine phosphorylation is significantly enhanced concomitantly with increased physical association with BTK. B-cell receptor-induced SLP76 phosphorylation is mediated by upstream signaling events involving LCK and SYK. Knockdown of SLP76 in the cells resulted in decreased induction of BTK, PLCgamma2 and IkappaB phosphorylation, as well as cell viability after B-cell receptor activation with anti-IgM. Consistent with our biochemical findings, high total SLP76 expression in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells correlated with a more aggressive disease course.

To characterize representation of primary disease within cell lines, molecular features were compared using RNA-sequencing and cytogenetics. High-throughput screening revealed variable efficacy of currently used drugs, however identified consistent efficacy of three novel drug classes: proteasome inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Gene expression of drug targets was highly reproducible comparing iALL cell lines to matched primary specimens. Histone deacetylase inhibitors, including romidepsin (ROM), enhanced the activity of a key component of iALL therapy, cytarabine (ARAC) in vitro and combined administration of ROM and ARAC to xenografted mice further reduced leukemia burden. Molecular studies showed that ROM reduces expression of cytidine deaminase, an enzyme involved in ARAC deactivation, and enhances the DNA damage-response to ARAC.

Here, we use B-cell tumors as a model to address the mechanism of action of JQ1, a widely used BET inhibitor. Although JQ1 led to widespread eviction of BRD4 from chromatin, its effect on gene transcription was limited to a restricted set of genes. This was unlinked to Myc downregulation or its chromatin association. Yet, JQ1-sensitive genes were enriched for Myc and E2F targets, were expressed at high levels, and showed high promoter occupancy by RNAPol2, BRD4, Myc and E2F. Their marked decrease in transcriptional elongation upon JQ1 treatment, indicated that BRD4-dependent promoter clearance was rate limiting for transcription. At JQ1-insensitive genes the drop in transcriptional elongation still occurred, but was compensated by enhanced RNAPol2 recruitment. Similar results were obtained with other inhibitors of transcriptional elongation. Thus, the selective transcriptional effects following JQ1 treatment are linked to the inability of JQ1-sensitive genes to sustain compensatory RNAPol2 recruitment to promoters. These observations highlight the role of BET proteins in supporting transcriptional elongation and rationalize how a general suppression of elongation may selectively affects transcription.",,"['Donato, E', 'Croci, O', 'Sabo, A', 'Muller, H', 'Morelli, M J', 'Pelizzola, M', 'Campaner, S']","['Donato E', 'Croci O', 'Sabo A', 'Muller H', 'Morelli MJ', 'Pelizzola M', 'Campaner S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4547-6849'],"['Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.', 'Center for Genomic Science of IIT@SEMM, Fondazione Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia (IIT), Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (BRD4 protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Azepines/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatin/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/metabolism', 'E2F Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Triazoles/*pharmacology']",PMC5310924,2016/07/23 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/07/23 06:00'],"['2016/02/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016182 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):479-490. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.182.

In hematological malignancies, acute compartment syndrome caused by severe soft tissue bleeding is extremely rare. We present a patient with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia who had acute compartment syndrome caused by severe soft tissue bleeding in her right forearm. CASE PRESENTATION: A 72-year-old Japanese woman was referred to our hospital with swelling and pain of her right forearm without a previous history of trauma. She was diagnosed with chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia. Extreme thrombocytosis was present, although no evidence of acquired von Willebrand disorder was found. Compartment syndrome caused by soft tissue bleeding was confirmed. An emergency fasciotomy for decompression was conducted.

Treatment resistance to TKIs still remains an important problem in the treatment of CML. The aim of our study was to analyze the molecular response (MR) in CML patients treated with Imatinib in our institution. We have analyzed 53 CML patients (pts), 28 females and 25 males, treated with IM as a front or second line treatment. Only 15 pts were treated with IM as a front-line therapy, while 38 pts were pretreated with hydroxyurea or/and interferon. Median duration of CML was 6 years (range: 1 year- 17 years). Median duration of IM treatment was 3 years (range: 1 year-10 years). MR was analyzed in one up to 8 time points with Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR method.

MMR was not achieved in 24/53(45.3%). Our results have shown smaller percentage of patients (55%) with MMR, mostly due to the fact that larger proportion of patients (38/53) were heavily pretreated with HU or/and Interferon for a prolonged period of time, before the IM treatment.

A notable example of such a case is bacterial l-asparaginases (L-ASNases) used for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The replacement of the bacterial enzymes by human ones is thought to set the basis for a major improvement of antileukemic therapy. Recently, we solved the crystal structure of a human enzyme possessing L-ASNase activity, designated hASNase-3. This enzyme is expressed as an inactive precursor protein and post-translationally undergoes intramolecular processing leading to the generation of two subunits which remain noncovalently, yet tightly associated and constitute the catalytically active form of the enzyme. We discovered that this intramolecular processing can be drastically and selectively accelerated by the free amino acid glycine. In the present study, we report on the molecular engineering of hASNase-3 aiming at the improvement of its catalytic properties. We created a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based high-throughput screening system for the characterization of rationally designed mutant libraries, capitalizing on the finding that free glycine promotes autoproteolytic cleavage, which activates the mutant proteins expressed in an E. coli strain devoid of aspartate biosynthesis. Successive screening rounds led to the isolation of catalytically improved variants showing up to 6-fold better catalytic efficiency as compared to the wild-type enzyme. Our work establishes a powerful strategy for further exploitation of the human asparaginase sequence space to facilitate the identification of in vitro-evolved enzyme species that will lay the basis for improved ALL therapy.",,"['Karamitros, Christos S', 'Konrad, Manfred']","['Karamitros CS', 'Konrad M']",,"['Enzyme Biochemistry Group, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Gottingen, D-37077, Germany.', 'Enzyme Biochemistry Group, Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Gottingen, D-37077, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160801,United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)'],IM,"['Asparaginase/genetics/*isolation & purification/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Fluorescence', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy']",,2016/07/22 06:00,2017/06/27 06:00,['2016/07/22 06:00'],"['2016/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acschembio.6b00283 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2016 Sep 16;11(9):2596-607. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.6b00283.

Much of the previous research on social media and health communication has focused on Facebook groups related to a specific disease or Facebook pages related to an advocacy organization. Less is known about how people communicate about cancer on personal Facebook pages. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we expand upon previous research by examining how cancer caregivers use personal Facebook pages for cancer-related communication. METHODS: We examined themes in cancer-related exchanges through a content analysis of 12 months of data from 18 publically available Facebook pages hosted by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (15 852 total posts). RESULTS: Six themes emerged: (1) documenting the cancer journey, (2) sharing emotional strain associated with caregiving, (3) promoting awareness and advocacy about pediatric cancer, (4) fundraising, (5) mobilizing support, and (6) expressing gratitude for support. CONCLUSIONS: Building upon previous research documenting the increasing use of social media for health-related communication and support, our findings show that personal Facebook pages offer a platform for cancer caregivers to share their cancer-related experiences, promote advocacy and awareness, and mobilize social support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Providers must recognize the importance of social media as a vehicle for support and communication for families of children with cancer. Nurses should educate parents on how to appraise information obtained through Facebook using evidence-based guidelines.

L-asparaginase is an integral component of treatment for patients with ALL and since its introduction into pediatric treatment protocols in the 1960s, survival rates in children have progressively risen to nearly 90%. Outcomes for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients, aged 15-39 years and diagnosed with ALL, have historically been less favorable. However, recent reports suggest substantially increased survival in AYA patients treated on pediatric-inspired protocols that include a greater cumulative dose of asparaginase. All currently available asparaginases share the same mechanism of action - the deamination and depletion of serum asparagine levels - yet each displays a markedly different pharmacokinetic profile. Pegylated asparaginase derived from the bacterium Escherichia coli is used as first-line therapy; however, up to 30% of patients develop a treatment-limiting hypersensitivity reaction. Patients who experience a hypersensitivity reaction to an E. coli-derived asparaginase can continue treatment with Erwinia chrysanthemi asparaginase. Erwinia asparaginase is immunologically distinct from E. coli-derived asparaginases and exhibits no cross-reactivity. Studies have shown that with adequate dosing, therapeutic levels of Erwinia asparaginase activity can be achieved, and patients switched to Erwinia asparaginase due to hypersensitivity can obtain outcomes similar to patients who do not experience a hypersensitivity reaction.

Sloan, et al., PLoS Pathog 11:e1005059, 2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005059). Since it is well known that certain other components of the PML NB complex play an important role during an intrinsic immune response to HSV-1 and are also degraded or inactivated by ICP0, here we further investigate the role of MORC3 during HSV-1 infection. We demonstrate that MORC3 has antiviral activity during HSV-1 infection and that this antiviral role is counteracted by ICP0. In addition, MORC3's antiviral role extends to wild-type (wt) human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection, as its plaque-forming efficiency increased in MORC3-depleted cells. We found that MORC3 is recruited to sites associated with HSV-1 genomes after their entry into the nucleus of an infected cell, and in wt infections this is followed by its association with ICP0 foci prior to its degradation. The RING finger domain of ICP0 was required for degradation of MORC3, and we confirmed that no other HSV-1 protein is required for the loss of MORC3. We also found that MORC3 is required for fully efficient recruitment of PML, Sp100, hDaxx, and gammaH2AX to sites associated with HSV-1 genomes entering the host cell nucleus. This study further unravels the intricate ways in which HSV-1 has evolved to counteract the host immune response and reveals a novel function for MORC3 during the host intrinsic immune response. IMPORTANCE: Herpesviruses have devised ways to manipulate the host intrinsic immune response to promote their own survival and persistence within the human population. One way in which this is achieved is through degradation or functional inactivation of PML NB proteins, which are recruited to viral genomes in order to repress viral transcription. Because MORC3 associates with PML NBs in uninfected cells and is a target for HSV-1-mediated degradation, we investigated the role of MORC3 during HSV-1 infection. We found that MORC3 is also recruited to viral HSV-1 genomes, and importantly it contributes to the fully efficient recruitment of PML, hDaxx, Sp100, and gammaH2AX to these sites. Depletion of MORC3 resulted in an increase in ICP0-null HSV-1 and wt HCMV replication and plaque formation; therefore, this study reveals that MORC3 is an antiviral factor which plays an important role during HSV-1 and HCMV infection.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Materials and Methods The authors used the American Medical Association Physician Masterfile to construct a cohort of 43 763 radiologists (20% women) and 64 990 psychiatrists (27% women) (comparison group) who graduated from medical school in 1916-2006. Vital status was obtained from record linkages with the Social Security Administration and commercial databases, and cause of death was obtained from the National Death Index. Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all causes and specific causes of death. Results During the follow-up period (1979-2008), 4260 male radiologists and 7815 male psychiatrists died. The male radiologists had lower death rates (all causes) compared with the psychiatrists (RR = 0.94; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.97), similar cancer death rates overall (RR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.93, 1.07), but increased acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndrome death rates (RR = 1.62; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.50); these rates were driven by those who graduated before 1940 (RR = 4.68; 95% CI: 0.91, 24.18). In these earliest workers (before 1940) there were also increased death rates from melanoma (RR = 8.75; 95% CI: 1.89, 40.53), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (RR = 2.69; 95% CI: 1.33, 5.45), and cerebrovascular disease (RR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.11, 2.01). The 208 deaths in female radiologists precluded detailed investigation, and the number of female radiologists who graduated before 1940 was very small (n = 47). Conclusion The excess risk of acute myeloid leukemia and/or myelodysplastic syndrome mortality in radiologists who graduated before 1940 is likely due to occupational radiation exposure. The melanoma, NHL, and cerebrovascular disease mortality risks are possibly due to radiation. The authors found no evidence of excess mortality in radiologists who graduated more recently, possibly because of increased radiation protection and/or lifestyle changes.

Here, we evaluated the antiproliferative activity and the toxicological effects of the methanolic extract and a pure compound obtained from Solanum capsicoides seeds. The phytochemical profile was analyzed by chromatographic and spectroscopy methods. The acute toxicity was assessed in mice orally treated with the extract (2000 mg/kg), in vitro hemolytic activity and micronucleus test. The mutagenicity, developmental toxicity, and lethal dose (LD50) of carpesterol were estimated by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool (TEST) software. A sulforhodamine B assay was employed to evaluate the antiproliferative activity. The toxicological assays did not observe signs of toxicity, either during the behavioral observations or in the autopsies, as well as no mutagenicity and hemolytic activity. The carpesterol did not present mutagenic effect and hemolytic activity but presents developmental toxicology and LD50 of 410 mg/kg in toxicity estimations by the TEST software. The S. capsicoides extract exhibited antiproliferative activity mainly in leukemia (K562) cell lineage. However, carpesterol presented antiproliferative activity in glioma (U251), breast (MCF-7), kidney (786-0), ovary (OVCAR-03), and K562 cell lineages.

However current unmet clinical needs include combating activation of additional survival signaling pathways in persistent leukemia stem cells after long-term TKI therapy. A ubiquitous signaling alteration in cancer, including CML, is activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling, which may potentiate stem cell activity and mediate resistance to both conventional chemotherapy and targeted inhibitors. We have developed a novel nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor, imipramine blue (IB) that targets ROS generation. ROS levels are known to be elevated in CML with respect to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and not corrected by TKI. We demonstrate that IB has additive benefit with nilotinib in inhibiting proliferation, viability, and clonogenic function of TKI-insensitive quiescent CD34+ CML chronic phase (CP) cells while normal CD34+ cells retained their clonogenic capacity in response to this combination therapy in vitro. Mechanistically, the pro-apoptotic activity of IB likely resides in part through its dual ability to block NF-kappaB and re-activate the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Combining BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibition with NADPH oxidase blockade may be beneficial in eradication of CML and worthy of further investigation.",,"['Laidlaw, Kamilla M E', 'Berhan, Samuel', 'Liu, Suhu', 'Silvestri, Giovannino', 'Holyoake, Tessa L', 'Frank, David A', 'Aggarwal, Bharat', 'Bonner, Michael Y', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Jorgensen, Heather G', 'Arbiser, Jack L']","['Laidlaw KM', 'Berhan S', 'Liu S', 'Silvestri G', 'Holyoake TL', 'Frank DA', 'Aggarwal B', 'Bonner MY', 'Perrotti D', 'Jorgensen HG', 'Arbiser JL']",,"[""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, G12 0ZD, United Kingdom."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, G12 0ZD, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, G12 0ZD, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02215, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Department of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Atlanta Veterans Administration Hospital, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow, G12 0ZD, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Dermatology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Atlanta Veterans Administration Hospital, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",['eng'],"['11008/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'P30 AR042687/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AR047901/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA163800/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'OGG85SX4E4 (Imipramine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imipramine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",PMC5239504,2016/07/21 06:00,2018/02/07 06:00,['2016/07/21 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10541 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10541 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 9;7(32):51651-51664. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10541.,['NOTNLM'],"['NADPH oxidase', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imipramine blue', 'nilotinib', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,"['J.L.A. is the inventor of imipramine blue (US Patent 8435979) which is owned by', 'Emory University.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2600 samples peripheral (blood, bone marrow, fine-needle aspirate, lymph node, and pleural fluid cell suspensions) were analyzed using a 10-color B-cell panel and a 10-color T-cell panel. A 10-color plasma cell/lymphoplasmacytic panel was performed when appropriate. RESULTS: 790/2600 samples (30%) showed at least one aberrant B-cell population and 27(1%) showed an aberrant T-cell population. 41/790 samples (5.1%) showed two aberrant B-cell populations. Thirteen patients had two B-cell populations with different surface immunoglobulin restriction (one kappa+ and one lambda+), most with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia-related phenotype. Five cases showed two B-cell populations with the same light chain restriction but distinctly different immunophenotypes. In 23 cases, two populations had the same light chain restriction and differed by expression of one or 2 markers, thus, a possibility of intraclonal differentiation could not be excluded. Cases with possible intraclonal differentiation had a significantly higher proportion of aberrant B-cells than those with two coexisting aberrant B-cell populations (49.9% vs. 27.7%, p = 0.008). In only one sample one population of clonal B-cell and one clonal T-cell population with large granular lymphocyte related phenotype were found. CONCLUSION: Using our panels 5.1% of cases with lymphoproliferative disorder-associated aberrant findings show two aberrant (clonal) lymphoid and/or plasma cell populations.

A detailed toxicity profile of this platform has not previously been reported. The toxicity and response rates for its use beyond first relapse are unknown. PROCEDURES: We performed a multi-institutional, retrospective study including children with relapsed ALL treated with the R3 reinduction chemotherapy backbone block 1 across five pediatric centers. Data were extracted from medical records and analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were included in the study, including 16 patients with >/=2nd relapse. Ninety-seven percent of patients experienced at least one Grade >/=3 nonhematologic adverse event (AE). Grade 3 or higher infection was reported in 90% of patients. Other nonhematologic Grade >/=3 AEs included electrolyte abnormalities, elevation in hepatic enzymes, and pain. Eighty-five percent of patients achieved a complete remission (CR). There were no significant differences in the incidence of AEs, CR rate, and rate of minimal residual disease negativity between patients with 1st or >/=2nd relapse. CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that R3 block 1 is a highly active reinduction regimen in childhood relapsed ALL. However, it was associated with a high incidence of severe toxicities, particularly infection. The toxicity profiled in our report should be used to inform optimal supportive care and future clinical trial design with the R3 backbone, particularly when new agents are combined with this regimen.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Sun, Weili', 'Orgel, Etan', 'Malvar, Jemily', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Wilkes, Jennifer J', 'Gardner, Rebecca', 'Tolbert, Vanessa P', 'Smith, Alison', 'Hur, Minjun', 'Hoffman, Jill', 'Rheingold, Susan R', 'Burke, Michael J', 'Wayne, Alan S']","['Sun W', 'Orgel E', 'Malvar J', 'Sposto R', 'Wilkes JJ', 'Gardner R', 'Tolbert VP', 'Smith A', 'Hur M', 'Hoffman J', 'Rheingold SR', 'Burke MJ', 'Wayne AS']",,"[""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California. wsun@chla.usc.edu."", 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California. wsun@chla.usc.edu.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, Washington."", 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', 'School of Medicine, St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.', ""Infectious Disease, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Division of Oncology, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Pediatric Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin."", ""Children's Center for Cancer and Blood Diseases, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, California."", 'Keck School of Medicine, USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.']",['eng'],['P30 CA014089/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160720,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC7451261,2016/07/21 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/21 06:00'],"['2016/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26129 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1943-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26129.

However, ABL TKIs cannot eradicate leukemia stem cells. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for Ph-positive leukemia are needed. Aberrant activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is important for the initiation and maintenance of human cancers. Copanlisib (BAY80-6946) is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kalpha and PI3K-delta. Here we investigated the efficacy of combination therapy of copanlisib with an ABL TKI (imatinib, nilotinib, or ponatinib) using BCR-ABL-positive cells. Although the effects of the ABL TKI treatment were reduced in the presence of the feeder cell line, HS-5, copanlisib inhibited cell growth. Upon combining ABL TKI and copanlisib, cell growth was reduced. Ponatinib and copanlisib combined therapy reduced tumor volume and increased survival in mouse allograft models, respectively. These results indicate that the PI3Kalpha and -delta inhibitors overcame the chemoprotective effects of the feeder cells and enhanced ABL TKI cytotoxicity. Thus, co-treatment with ABL TKI and copanlisib may be a powerful strategy against ABL TKI-resistant cells, including those harboring the related T315I mutation.",,"['Okabe, Seiichi', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Tanaka, Yuko', 'Sakuta, Juri', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Okabe S', 'Tauchi T', 'Tanaka Y', 'Sakuta J', 'Ohyashiki K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'WI6V529FZ9 (copanlisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Imidazoles/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",PMC5288172,2016/07/21 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/07/21 06:00'],"['2016/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['10605 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10605 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):53116-53126. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10605.,['NOTNLM'],"['ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'feeder cell', 'phosphoinositide 3-kinase']",,"['Kazuma Ohyashiki received research support from Novartis and Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'Company.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The control group was left uninfected and was mock-inoculated with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). Mortality rates, body weights, cecal lesions, and viremia of infected chickens in each group were evaluated. Immune status was evaluated by measuring several parameters: immune organ weight/body weight index, specific humoral responses to inactivated NDV vaccine and to inoculated E. tenella, proportions of blood CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD8alpha+ lymphocytes and transcriptional levels of cytokines in blood and cecal tonsils. The results show that co-infections of ALV-J and E. tenella induced a higher mortality rate and a lower body weight in SPF chickens compared to single-pathogen infection. In co-infected chickens, ALV-J accelerated the disease symptoms induced by E. tenella, and the E. tenella extended the ALV-J viremia.

We previously reported that the IL-9-dependent TS1 cell line sequentially acquired activating substitutions in JAK1 and JAK3 upon successive selections for growth factor independent and JAK inhibitor-resistant cells, suggestive of a defect in mutation avoidance mechanisms. In the first part of this paper, we discovered that the gene encoding mutL homolog-1 (MLH1), a key component of the DNA mismatch repair system, is silenced by promoter methylation in TS1 cells. By means of stable ectopic expression and RNA interference methods, we showed that the high frequencies of growth factor-independent and inhibitor-resistant cells with activating JAK mutations can be attributed to the absence of MLH1 expression. In the second part of this paper, we confirm the clinical relevance of our findings by showing that chronic myeloid leukemia relapses upon ABL-targeted therapy correlated with a lower expression of MLH1 messenger RNA. Interestingly, the mutational profile observed in our TS1 model, characterized by a strong predominance of T:A>C:G transitions, was identical to the one described in the literature for primitive cells derived from chronic myeloid leukemia patients.

The aims of the present study were to describe the incidence of NPM1, FLT3 and CEBPA mutations and to analyze their prognostic impact in this population. The incidences of these mutations within a population of 216 pediatric AML cases were: NPM1-mutated 4.2 %, CEBPA-mutated 1.9 %, FLT3-ITD 10.2 % and FLT3-TKD 7.9 %. Among 33 patients with normal karyotype, we found significantly higher frequencies for NPM1-mutated 24.2 % and CEBPA-mutated 12.1 %. Overall survival (pOS) for the 163 eligible non-acute promyelocytic leukemia cases was 46.2 +/- 4.3 %, while leukemia-free survival probability was 51.0 +/- 4.4 % (n = 135). The NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD-negative genotype showed better outcome than any other combined NPM1/FLT3 genotype; this difference was statistically significant within the group of high-risk patients (pOS +/- SE 83.3 +/- 15.2 % versus 33.1 +/- 4.7 %; p = 0.0251). This is the first report of the frequencies of these mutations in Argentina. Despite the limited number of patients, a favorable prognosis of AML with genotype NPM1-mutated/FLT3-ITD-negative was confirmed.

RAG2 localizes directly to lysine 4 trimethylated histone 3 (H3K4me3) through a plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. The relative contribution of RAG2-dependent and RAG1-intrinsic mechanisms in determining RAG1 binding patterns is not known. Through analysis of deep RAG1 ChIP-seq data, we provide a quantitative description of the forces underlying genome-wide targeting of RAG1. Surprisingly, sequence-specific DNA binding contributes minimally to RAG1 targeting outside of antigen receptor loci. Instead, RAG1 binding is driven by two distinct modes of interaction with chromatin: the first is driven by H3K4me3, promoter-focused and dependent on the RAG2 PHD, and the second is defined by H3K27Ac, enhancer-focused and dependent on 'non-core' portions of RAG1. Based on this and additional chromatin and genomic features, we formulated a predictive model of RAG1 targeting to the genome. RAG1 binding sites predicted by our model correlate well with observed patterns of RAG1-mediated breaks in human pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Overall, this study provides an integrative model for RAG1 genome-wide binding and off-target activity and reveals a novel role for the RAG1 non-core region in RAG1 targeting.","['(c) The Author(s) 2016.

Using a microfluidic device, cell mechanotype can be rapidly analyzed by measuring the time required for cells to deform as they flow through constricted channels. While cells typically exhibit deformation timescales, or transit times, on the order of milliseconds to tens of seconds, transit times can span several orders of magnitude and vary from day to day within a population of single cells; this makes it challenging to characterize different cell samples based on transit time data. Here we investigate how variability in transit time measurements depends on both experimental factors and heterogeneity in physical properties across a population of single cells. We find that simultaneous transit events that occur across neighboring constrictions can alter transit time, but only significantly when more than 65% of channels in the parallel array are occluded. Variability in transit time measurements is also affected by the age of the device following plasma treatment, which could be attributed to changes in channel surface properties. We additionally investigate the role of variability in cell physical properties. Transit time depends on cell size; by binning transit time data for cells of similar diameters, we reduce measurement variability by 20%. To gain further insight into the effects of cell-to-cell differences in physical properties, we fabricate a panel of gel particles and oil droplets with tunable mechanical properties. We demonstrate that particles with homogeneous composition exhibit a marked reduction in transit time variability, suggesting that the width of transit time distributions reflects the degree of heterogeneity in subcellular structure and mechanical properties within a cell population. Our results also provide fundamental insight into the physical underpinnings of transit measurements: transit time depends strongly on particle elastic modulus, and weakly on viscosity and surface tension. Based on our findings, we present a comprehensive methodology for designing, analyzing, and reducing variability in transit time measurements; this should facilitate broader implementation of transit experiments for rapid mechanical phenotyping in basic research and clinical settings.",,"['Nyberg, Kendra D', 'Scott, Michael B', 'Bruce, Samuel L', 'Gopinath, Ajay B', 'Bikos, Dimitri', 'Mason, Thomas G', 'Kim, Jin Woong', 'Choi, Hong Sung', 'Rowat, Amy C']","['Nyberg KD', 'Scott MB', 'Bruce SL', 'Gopinath AB', 'Bikos D', 'Mason TG', 'Kim JW', 'Choi HS', 'Rowat AC']",,"['Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. rowat@ucla.edu and Department of Bioengineering, University of California, Los Angeles, USA.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. rowat@ucla.edu.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. rowat@ucla.edu.', 'Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology, University of California, Los Angeles, USA. rowat@ucla.edu.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, USA and Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Los Angeles, USA.', 'Department of Bionano Technology, Hanyang University, Ansan, 426-791, Republic of Korea and Department of Applied Chemistry, Hanyang University, Ansan, 426-791, Republic of Korea.', 'Shinsegae International Co.

This makes it harder to reproduce the exact values of measurements coming from different laboratories. Furthermore, some cancer types are very heterogeneous, meaning that there might be different underlying causes for the same type of cancer among different individuals. If a model does not take potential biases in the data into account, this can lead to problems when trying to predict the stage of a certain cancer type. This is especially true when these biases differ between the training and test set. RESULTS: We introduce a method that can estimate this bias on a per-feature level and incorporate calculated feature confidences into a weighted combination of classifiers with disjoint feature sets. In this way, the method provides a prediction that is adjusted for the potential biases on a per-patient basis, providing a personalized prediction for each test patient. The new method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many different cancer data sets with measured DNA methylation or gene expression. Moreover, we show how to visualize the learned classifiers to display interesting associations with the target label. Applied to a leukemia data set, our method finds several ribosomal proteins associated with the risk group, which might be interesting targets for follow-up studies. This discovery supports the hypothesis that the ribosomes are a new frontier in genadaptivelearninge regulation. CONCLUSION: We introduce a new method for robust prediction of phenotypes from molecular measurements such as DNA methylation or gene expression. Furthermore, the visualization capabilities enable exploratory analysis on the learnt dependencies and pave the way for a personalized prediction of phenotypes.

Understanding of cancer stemness-related signaling pathways at the molecular level will help control cancer and stop metastasis in the clinic.Experimental Design: By analyzing miRNA profiles and functions in cancer development, we aimed to identify regulators of breast tumor stemness and metastasis in human xenograft models in vivo and examined their effects on self-renewal and invasion of breast cancer cells in vitro To discover the direct targets and essential signaling pathways responsible for miRNA functions in breast cancer progression, we performed microarray analysis and target gene prediction in combination with functional studies on candidate genes (overexpression rescues and pheno-copying knockdowns).Results: In this study, we report that hsa-miR-206 suppresses breast tumor stemness and metastasis by inhibiting both self-renewal and invasion. We identified that among the candidate targets, twinfilin (TWF1) rescues the miR-206 phenotype in invasion by enhancing the actin cytoskeleton dynamics and the activity of the mesenchymal lineage transcription factors, megakaryoblastic leukemia (translocation) 1 (MKL1), and serum response factor (SRF). MKL1 and SRF were further demonstrated to promote the expression of IL11, which is essential for miR-206's function in inhibiting both invasion and stemness of breast cancer.Conclusions: The identification of the miR-206/TWF1/MKL1-SRF/IL11 signaling pathway sheds lights on the understanding of breast cancer initiation and progression, unveils new therapeutic targets, and facilitates innovative drug development to control cancer and block metastasis.

As no antibodies are clinically available for immunotherapy of myeloid leukemias (MLs), we aimed to develop an Fc-optimized CD133 mAb for induction of NK ADCC against MLs. When comparing different available CD133 mAbs, no difference was observed with regard to binding to primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells. However, clone 293C3 recognized acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells in a substantially higher percentage of patient cases and was thus chosen to generate chimeric mAbs with either wild-type Fc part (293C3-WT) or a variant containing amino-acid exchanges (S239D/I332E) to enhance affinity to CD16 on NK cells (293C3-SDIE). In vitro, treatment with 293C3-SDIE significantly enhanced activation, degranulation and lysis of primary CD133-positive AML cells by allogeneic and autologous NK cells as compared with its wild-type counterpart. In line with the observed lower expression levels of CD133 on healthy cells compared with malignant hematopoietic cells, 293C3-SDIE caused no relevant toxicity towards committed hematopoietic progenitor cells. In a NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIL2rgtmWjl/Sz xenotransplantation model, 293C3-SDIE facilitated elimination of patient AML cells by human NK cells. Thus, 293C3-SDIE constitutes an attractive immunotherapeutic compound, in particular for elimination of minimal residual disease in the context of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in AML.",,"['Koerner, S P', 'Andre, M C', 'Leibold, J S', 'Kousis, P C', 'Kubler, A', 'Pal, M', 'Haen, S P', 'Buhring, H-J', 'Grosse-Hovest, L', 'Jung, G', 'Salih, H R']","['Koerner SP', 'Andre MC', 'Leibold JS', 'Kousis PC', 'Kubler A', 'Pal M', 'Haen SP', 'Buhring HJ', 'Grosse-Hovest L', 'Jung G', 'Salih HR']",,"['Department for Internal Medicine II, Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, University Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Department for Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Internal Medicine II, Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Immunology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department for Internal Medicine II, Clinical Collaboration Unit Translational Immunology, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Partner site Tubingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Eberhard Karls University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160720,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice']",,2016/07/21 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/07/21 06:00'],"['2016/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016194 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.194 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):459-469. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.194.

Consequently, 8 top-ranked hits were eventually identified and were further subjected to MD simulation. It was indicated that all hits could reach equilibrium with DOT1L in the MD simulation and further binding free energy calculations suggested that phenoxyacetamide-derived hits such as L01, L03, L04 and L05 exhibited remarkably higher binding affinity compared to other hits.

We identified consecutive patients with FLT3-ITD AML diagnosed between 2008 and 2014 who received haematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in first complete remission (CR1). Post-HCT initiation of sorafenib (yes/no) was evaluated as a time-varying covariate in the overall survival/progression-free survival (OS/PFS) analysis and we performed a landmark analysis of controls alive without relapse at the median date of sorafenib initiation. We identified 26 sorafenib patients and 55 controls. Median follow-up was 27.2 months post-HCT for sorafenib survivors, and 38.4 months for controls (P = 0.021). The median time to initiating sorafenib was 68 days post-HCT; 43 controls were alive without relapse at this cut-off. Sorafenib patients had improved 2-year OS in the d+68 landmark analysis (81% vs. 62%, P = 0.029). Sorafenib was associated with improved 2-year PFS (82% vs. 53%, P = 0.0081) and lower 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (8.2% vs. 37.7%, P = 0.0077).

Furthermore, they report a possible benefit on motor and cognitive outcomes. We debate the safety of Nilotinib and the reported efficacy signals.

However, the role of BDNF in pediatric AL remains poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We carried out a cohort observational study to evaluate BDNF levels in BM or peripheral blood (PB) samples from children with AL. METHODS: BM or PB samples were collected from 57 children and adolescents with acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL), 14 children and adolescents with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and 44 healthy individuals (HI) of the same age range. RESULTS: BDNF levels at diagnosis in AL patients were significantly lower when compared to HI. Samples from patients in complete remission from disease had higher levels of BDNF compared to those obtained from patients with malignant cells. Moreover, BDNF levels at diagnosis in patients who died were significantly lower compared to those found in survivors.

Identification of the atypical plasma cells in the body fluids may be critical for prognostic considerations. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed clinicopathologic findings of 21 serous effusion specimens from 13 cases of ME including 10 pleural, two concurrent pleural and pericardial, and one peritoneal from 1994 to 2014. RESULT: All 13 patients had bone marrow biopsy-proven plasma cell myeloma (PCM), including one plasmablastic-variant, one anaplastic-variant and one plasma cell leukemia. The time between the bone marrow diagnoses to serous cavity involvement ranged from 43 days to 9 years (mean 2.6 years, median 1.8 years). Monoclonal protein types showed predominant IgA subtypes (50%) including IgA-kappa (2), IgA-lambda (3), IgG-kappa (2), IgG-lambda (1) free kappa chain (1) and free lambda chain (1) and three unknown. All 13 patients died of disease (median survival 32 days). Concurrent imaging studies showed evidence of adjacent local disease. Cytology of the serous fluids revealed abundant plasma cells with varying degrees of atypia, including large cells with increased N/Cratios, coarse chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. All were CD138 positive. Of these, Cytology confirmed malignancy in 19/21(90%) cases. Five cases were positive for kappa-light chain and eight cases for lambda-light chain. Cytogenetics of 3/7 cases showed normal karyotype and 4/7 cases showed complex-karyotype. The patients with kappa light-chain had better survival compared to lambda light-chain (p = 0.051, log rank test). CONCLUSION: ME in PCM can present early in the natural history of the disease or very late. The preponderance of IgA-myeloma and complex-cytogenetics abnormalities is a noteworthy finding. Although there are different hypotheses regarding how ME develops in PCM, our finding supports the hypothesis that direct spread of PCM into serous cavities is a likely mechanism. Diagn.

We developed a quantitative pyrosequencing-based methylation assay covering the TERT proximal promoter and a partial exon 1 (TERTpro/Ex1) region and tested both cell lines and primary leukaemia cells derived from AML and AML with preceding myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS) patients (n = 43). Prognostic impact of methylation status of the upstream TERT promoter region was assessed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The activity of the telomerase inhibitor, imetelstat, was measured using leukaemia cell lines. The TERTpro/Ex1 region was highly methylated in all cell lines and primary leukaemia cells showed diverse methylation profiles. Most cases showed hypermethylated regions at the upstream TERTpro/Ex1 region, which were associated with inferior patient survival.

On the other hand, histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as cholesteryl butyrate, present differentiating activity and.can potentiate action of drugs such as all-trans retinoic acid. Solid lipid nanoparticles represent a promising alternative for administration of hydrophobic drugs such as ATRA. This study aimed to develop, characterize, and evaluate the cytotoxicity of all-trans retinoic acid-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles for leukemia treatment. The influence of in situ formation of an ion pairing between all-trans retinoic acid and lipophilic amines on the characteristics of the particles (size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency) was evaluated. Cholesteryl butyrate, a butyric acid donor, was used as a component of the lipid matrix. In vitro activity on cell viability and distribution of cell cycle phases were evaluated for HL-60, Jurkat, and THP-1 cell lines. The encapsulation efficiency of all-trans retinoic acid in cholesteryl butyrate-solid lipid nanoparticles was significantly increased by the presence of the amine. Inhibition of cell viability by all-trans retinoic acid-loaded solid lipid nanoparticles was more pronounced than the free drug. Analysis of the distribution of cell cycle phases also showed increased activity for all-trans retinoic acid-loaded cholesteryl butyrate-solid lipid nanoparticles, with a clear increase in subdiploid DNA content. The ion pair formation in SLN containing cholesteryl butyrate can be explored as a simple and inexpensive strategy to improve the efficacy and bioavail-ability of ATRA in the treatment of the cancer and metabolic diseases in which this retinoid plays an important role.",,"['Silva, Elton Luiz', 'Lima, Flavia Alves', 'Carneiro, Guilherme', 'Ramos Jonas Periera', 'Gomes, Dawidson Assis', 'de Souza-Fagundes, Elaine Maria', 'Ferreira, Lucas Antonio Miranda']","['Silva EL', 'Lima FA', 'Carneiro G', 'Ramos Jonas Periera', 'Gomes DA', 'de Souza-Fagundes EM', 'Ferreira LA']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Nanosci Nanotechnol,Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,101088195,"['0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '50QA4YCP7F (cholesteryl butanoate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Cholesterol Esters/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', '*Tretinoin/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology']",,2016/07/20 06:00,2016/08/19 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1166/jnn.2016.11677 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nanosci Nanotechnol. 2016 Feb;16(2):1291-300. doi: 10.1166/jnn.2016.11677.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In real data analysis, such as microarray data, the dataset contains a huge number of insignificant and irrelevant features that tend to lose useful information. Classes with high relevance and feature sets with high significance are generally referred for the selected features, which determine the samples classification into their respective classes. In this paper, kernel fuzzy inference system (K-FIS) algorithm is applied to classify the microarray data (leukemia) using t-test as a feature selection method. Kernel functions are used to map original data points into a higher-dimensional (possibly infinite-dimensional) feature space defined by a (usually nonlinear) function varphi through a mathematical process called the kernel trick. This paper also presents a comparative study for classification using K-FIS along with support vector machine (SVM) for different set of features (genes). Performance parameters available in the literature such as precision, recall, specificity, F-measure, ROC curve, and accuracy are considered to analyze the efficiency of the classification model. From the proposed approach, it is apparent that K-FIS model obtains similar results when compared with SVM model.

In rare cases, bone marrow necrosis (BMN) and osteolytic lesions are presenting features of AML. The following case describes a patient with known polycythemia vera (PV) that presented with signs of multiple myeloma, including hypercalcemia, anemia, and lytic lesions of the thoracic spine and skull. Laboratory workup was not indicative of myeloma. A bone marrow biopsy was performed, which revealed extensive BMN and initial pathology was consistent with metastatic carcinoma. However, no immunohistochemical stains could be performed due to the extent of BMN; a repeat biopsy was therefore performed. Flow cytometry and CD45 staining were consistent with PV that had transformed to AML. Due to the patient's comorbidities, she was a poor candidate for stem cell transplant and did not wish to pursue chemotherapy. Ultimately, she pursued hospice care. Based on our literature review, both BMN and osteolytic lesions are rare manifestations of AML and have not been reported to occur simultaneously. These findings can lead to a diagnostic dilemma and suspicion of other malignancies.

ColDx is a gene expression, microarray-based assay shown to be independently prognostic for recurrence-free interval (RFI) and overall survival in CC. The objective of this study was to further validate ColDx using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens collected as part of the Alliance phase III trial, C9581. PATIENTS AND METHODS: C9581 evaluated edrecolomab versus observation in patients with stage II CC and reported no survival benefit. Under an initial case-cohort sampling design, a randomly selected subcohort (RS) comprised 514 patients from 901 eligible patients with available tissue. Forty-nine additional patients with recurrence events were included in the analysis. Final analysis comprised 393 patients: 360 RS (58 events) and 33 non-RS events. Risk status was determined for each patient by ColDx. The Self-Prentice method was used to test the association between the resulting ColDx risk score and RFI adjusting for standard prognostic variables. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent of patients (216 of 393) were classified as high risk. After adjustment for prognostic variables that included mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, ColDx high-risk patients exhibited significantly worse RFI (multivariable hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; P < .01). Age and MMR status were marginally significant. RFI at 5 years for patients classified as high risk was 82% (95% CI, 79% to 85%), compared with 91% (95% CI, 89% to 93%) for patients classified as low risk. CONCLUSION: ColDx is associated with RFI in the C9581 subsample in the presence of other prognostic factors, including MMR deficiency. ColDx could be incorporated with the traditional clinical markers of risk to refine patient prognosis.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Frankel, Wendy L', 'Venook, Alan P', 'Ye, Xing', 'Friedman, Paula N', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Colacchio, Thomas Anthony', 'Mulligan, Jude Marie', 'Davison, Timothy S', ""O'Brien, Eamonn"", 'Kerr, Peter', 'Johnston, Patrick G', 'Kennedy, Richard D', 'Harkin, D Paul', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Bertagnolli, Monica M', 'Warren, Robert S', 'Innocenti, Federico']","['Niedzwiecki D', 'Frankel WL', 'Venook AP', 'Ye X', 'Friedman PN', 'Goldberg RM', 'Mayer RJ', 'Colacchio TA', 'Mulligan JM', 'Davison TS', ""O'Brien E"", 'Kerr P', 'Johnston PG', 'Kennedy RD', 'Harkin DP', 'Schilsky RL', 'Bertagnolli MM', 'Warren RS', 'Innocenti F']",,"[""Donna Niedzwiecki and Xing Ye, Duke University, Durham; Federico Innocenti, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC; Wendy L.

Nowadays, more and more research focuses on the design of the arsenic drugs, especially organic arsenicals, and on the mechanism of the inducing cell death. Here we have synthesized some organic arsenicals with Schiff base structure, which showed a better antitumor activity for three different kinds of cancer cell lines, namely HL-60, SGC 7901 and MCF-7. Compound 2a (2-(((4-(oxoarsanyl)phenyl)imino)methyl)phenol) and 2b (2-methoxy-4-(((4-(oxoarsanyl)phenyl)imino)methyl)phenol) were chosen for further mechanism study due to their best inhibitory activities for HL-60 cells, of which the half inhibitory concentration (IC50) were 0.77 muM and 0.51 muM, respectively. It was illustrated that 2a or 2b primarily induced the elevation of reactive oxygen species, decrease of glutathione level, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of Caspase-3 and apoptosis, whereas all of the phenomena can be eliminated by the addition of antioxidants. Therefore, we concluded that compound 2a and 2b can induce the oxidative stress-mediated intrinsic apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Both the simplicity of structure with Schiff base group and the better anticancer efficiency demonstrate that organic arsenicals are worthy of further exploration as a class of potent antitumor drugs.",,"['Fan, Xiao-Yang', 'Chen, Xin-You', 'Liu, Yu-Jiao', 'Zhong, Hui-Min', 'Jiang, Feng-Lei', 'Liu, Yi']","['Fan XY', 'Chen XY', 'Liu YJ', 'Zhong HM', 'Jiang FL', 'Liu Y']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Chemistry and Molecular Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, P.

The WD-repeat protein embryonic ectoderm development (EED) is a non-catalytic but an essential component of PRC2 and its mutations were identified in hematopoietic malignancies. To clarify the role(s) of EED in adult hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis, we generated Eed conditional knockout (Eed(Delta/Delta)) mice. Eed(Delta/Delta) mice died in a short period with rapid decrease of hematopoietic cells. Hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) were markedly decreased with impaired bone marrow (BM) repopulation ability. Cell cycle analysis of HSPCs demonstrated increased S-phase fraction coupled with suppressed G0/G1 entry. Genes encoding cell adhesion molecules are significantly enriched in Eed(Delta/Delta) HSPCs, and consistently, Eed(Delta/Delta) HSPCs exhibited increased attachment to a major extracellular matrix component, fibronectin. Thus, EED deficiency increases proliferation on one side but promotes quiescence possibly by enhanced adhesion to the hematopoietic niche on the other, and these conflicting events would lead to abnormal differentiation and functional defect of Eed(Delta/Delta) HSPCs. In addition, Eed haploinsufficiency induced hematopoietic dysplasia, and Eed heterozygous mice were susceptible to malignant transformation and developed leukemia in cooperation with Evi1 overexpression. Our results demonstrated differentiation stage-specific and dose-dependent roles of EED in normal hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis.",,"['Ikeda, Kenichiro', 'Ueda, Takeshi', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Nakata, Yuichiro', 'Sera, Yasuyuki', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Miyama, Takahiko', 'Kobayashi, Hiroshi', 'Takubo, Keiyo', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Honda, Zen-Ichiro', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Matsubara, Akio', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Honda, Hiroaki']","['Ikeda K', 'Ueda T', 'Yamasaki N', 'Nakata Y', 'Sera Y', 'Nagamachi A', 'Miyama T', 'Kobayashi H', 'Takubo K', 'Kanai A', 'Oda H', 'Wolff L', 'Honda Z', 'Ichinohe T', 'Matsubara A', 'Suda T', 'Inaba T', 'Honda H']",,"['Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Stem Cell Biology, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1, Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, 8-1 Kawada-cho, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8666, Japan."", 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Health Care Center and Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Institute of Environmental Science for Human Life, Ochanomizu University, 2-1-1 Otsuka Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8611, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Urology, Institute of Biomedical and Health Sciences, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore Center for Translational Medicine, 14 Medical Drive, #12-01, 117599, Singapore.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Model, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, 1-2-3 Kasumi, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160719,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Eed protein, mouse)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology', 'Fibronectins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Haploinsufficiency', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Heterozygote', 'Histones', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/*genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",PMC4949429,2016/07/20 06:00,2018/06/05 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2016/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/06/05 06:00 [medline]']","['srep29454 [pii]', '10.1038/srep29454 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jul 19;6:29454. doi: 10.1038/srep29454.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress has been made in its treatment during the last few decades, and chemoimmunotherapy based on fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab is considered the treatment of choice for patients with standard-risk CLL and good performance status. However, due to the characterization of high-risk biological subgroups and its presentation in elderly patients and/or with comorbidities, targeted therapies, such as B-cell receptor inhibitors, have been developed and approved during the last few years.

Our previous study showed that metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (Grm3) may be involved in autoreactive B-cell apoptosis in a B-cell-depleted agent atacicept-treated lupus-like mice. In the present study, we explore whether Grm3 is involved in the apoptosis in B-cell-related tumor including multiple myeloma and B-cell leukemia. We found that human B-cell leukemia cell line Nalm-6 cells and mouse myeloma cell line SP 2/0 cells could express Grm3. In addition, Grm3 expression emerged mainly in the middle stage of Nalm-6 and SP 2/0 cell apoptosis. Furthermore, apoptosis-induced agents effectively upregulated Grm3 expression in SP 2/0 cells. Critically, Grm3 deficiency promoted tumor progression in an SP 2/0 xenograft mouse model by suppressing cell apoptosis, whereas Grm3 overexpression effectively upregulates SP 2/0 cell apoptosis. Finally, we showed that Grm3 mediated cell apoptosis by Foxo1. Together, our data suggest that Grm3 effectively suppresses the mouse myeloma cell line SP 2/0 cell growth by mediating apoptosis. Thus, Grm3 may be used as an indicator in apoptosis of B-cell-related tumor and a potential target for the treatment of B-cell-related tumor including multiple myeloma and B-cell leukemia.",,"['Liu, Xiaoling', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Wang, Zhiding', 'Wang, Xiaoqian', 'Zhu, Gaizhi', 'Han, Gencheng', 'Chen, Guojiang', 'Hou, Chunmei', 'Wang, Tianxiao', 'Shen, Beifen', 'Li, Yan', 'Ma, Ning', 'Xiao, He', 'Wang, Renxi']","['Liu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang Z', 'Wang X', 'Zhu G', 'Han G', 'Chen G', 'Hou C', 'Wang T', 'Shen B', 'Li Y', 'Ma N', 'Xiao H', 'Wang R']",,"['Laboratory of Immunology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Beijing 100850, P.R.

Activation-induced deaminase (AID) can drive lymphomagenesis by generating off-target DNA breaks at loci that harbor highly active enhancers and display convergent transcription. The first active transcriptional profiles from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients acquired here reveal striking similarity at structural variation (SV) sites. Specific transcriptional features, namely convergent transcription and Pol2 stalling, were detected at breakpoints. The overlap was most prominent at SV with recognition motifs for the recombination activating genes (RAG). We present signal feature analysis to detect vulnerable regions and quantified from human cells how convergent transcription contributes to R-loop generation and RNA polymerase stalling. Wide stalling regions were characterized by high DNAse hypersensitivity and unusually broad H3K4me3 signal.

A secondary mutation of threonine 790 (T790M) is associated with approximately half of the cases of acquired resistance. Strategies or agents to overcome this type of resistance are still limited. In this study, enhanced antitumor effect of AT-101, a-pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, on gefitinib was explored in NSCLC with T790M mutation. METHODS: The effect of cotreatment with AT-101 and gefitinib on the viability of NSCLC cell lines harboring acquired T790M mutation was investigated using the MTT assay. The cellular apoptosis of NSCLC cells after cotreatment with AT-101 and gefitinib was assessed by FITC-annexin V/PI assay and Western blots analysis. The potential underlying mechanisms of the enhanced therapeutic effect for AT-101 was also studied using Western blots analysis. The in vivo anti-cancer efficacy of the combination with AT-101 and gefitinib was examined in a mouse xenograft model. RESULTS: In this study, we found that treatment with AT-101 in combination with gefitinib significantly inhibited cell proliferation, as well as promoted apoptosis of EGFR TKIs resistant lung cancer cells. The apoptotic effects of the use of AT-101 was related to the blocking of antiapoptotic protein: Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1 and downregrulation of the molecules in EGFR pathway. The observed enhancements of tumor growth suppression in xenografts supported the reverse effect of AT-101 in NSCLC with T790M mutation, which has been found in in vitro studies before. CONCLUSIONS: AT-101 enhances gefitinib sensitivity in NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutations. The addition of AT-101 to gefitinib is a promising strategy to overcome EGFR TKIs resistance in NSCLC with EGFR T790M mutations.",,"['Zhao, Ren', 'Zhou, Shun', 'Xia, Bing', 'Zhang, Cui-Ying', 'Hai, Ping', 'Zhe, Hong', 'Wang, Yan-Yang']","['Zhao R', 'Zhou S', 'Xia B', 'Zhang CY', 'Hai P', 'Zhe H', 'Wang YY']",,"['Department of radiation oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Graduated School, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hangzhou Cancer Hospital, Nanjing Medical University, Hangzhou, 310000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of radiation oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Department of radiation oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Department of radiation oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Cancer Institute, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China.', 'Department of radiation oncology, General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China. fdwyy1981@hotmail.com.', 'Cancer Institute, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, Ningxia, China. fdwyy1981@hotmail.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160718,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'KAV15B369O (Gossypol)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)', 'S7RL72610R (gossypol acetic acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Gossypol/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quinazolines/*therapeutic use', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC4950625,2016/07/20 06:00,2017/09/29 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2015/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-016-2519-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-016-2519-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2016 Jul 18;16:491. doi: 10.1186/s12885-016-2519-3.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AT-101', '*Bcl-2', '*EGFR T790M mutation', '*EGFR TKIs resistance', '*Gefitinib', '*Non-small cell lung cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current study tested the hypothesis whether inhibition of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway could improve the anti-tumor effects of sorafenib in HCC. ICG-001, a small molecule which blocks the interaction of beta-catenin with its transcriptional coactivator CBP, dose-dependently enhanced the growth-suppressive and apoptosis-induction effects of sorafenib in multiple HCC cell lines. Downregulation of beta-catenin by RNA interference increased sorafenib sensitivity, whereas overexpression of beta-catenin reduced sorafenib sensitivity in Huh7 cells. The sorafenib-sensitization effect of short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated beta-catenin downregulation in Huh7 cells was attenuated by beta-catenin overexpression. Mechanistically, sorafenib combined with ICG-001 or shRNA-mediated beta-catenin downregulation augmented the induction of apoptosis, and resulted in a significant downregulation of Mcl-1 in HCC cells. In Huh7 cell mouse xenograft model, the combination of ICG-001 and sorafenib showed a more significant growth-retarding effect than single agent treatment of sorafenib or ICG-001.

All of the 13 patients had lymphatic systemic diseases (8 cases with diffuse large B cell lymphoma, 1 with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, 2 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 1 with multiple myeloma). 6 patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (3 cases with nausea and anorexia as well as the sentation of having a foreign body in pharyngeal, 2 cases with pain or a burning sensation behind the sternum, and 1 case having difficulty or pain when swallowing), while 7 patients had no obvious manifestations. 6 patients accepted fluconazole 400 mg/d for 2 weeks and achieved satisfactory results; Meanwhile 7 cases were given nystatin 1 million uint 3 times a day for 2 weeks, of which 6 cases responded well, and 1 case was not relieved until he was given fluconazole 400 mg/d for 1 week. Treatmentassociated adverse events included mildly elevated aminotransferase (1 case) and mild gastrointestinal adverse reaction (1 case). CONCLUSION: The fungal esophagitis in patients with hematologic malignancies was not rare. Most of those patients had lymphatic systemic diseases and the main pathogen was candida albicans. The clinical manifestations of fungal esophagitis were quite atypical and about more than half of those patients had no gastrointestinal symptoms. Either fluconazole or nystatin was safe and effective treatment with slight adverse reactions.",,"['Zhou, Y L', 'Wei, X D', 'Mi, R H', 'Ai, H', 'Zhang, L N', 'Liu, Y Y', 'Li, Y F', 'Song, Y P']","['Zhou YL', 'Wei XD', 'Mi RH', 'Ai H', 'Zhang LN', 'Liu YY', 'Li YF', 'Song YP']",,"['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou 450008, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,['8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)'],IM,"['Esophagitis/*microbiology', 'Fluconazole/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*microbiology', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*complications/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7348348,2016/07/20 06:00,2017/01/11 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.06.013 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jun 14;37(6):507-11. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0253-2727.2016.06.013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Screening ABL(Deltaexon7) and ABL(35INS) in 74 normal people and 76 CML patients (53 patients in remission and 23 patients with TKIs resistance) by using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis combined with cloning sequencing. RESULTS: A novel spliceosome ABL(Deltaexon7+ 35INS) (ABL(Deltaexon7) and ABL(3)5INS existed at the same time) was identified and the mutation was detected in 8 (10.8%) of 74 normal people, 4 (7.5%) of 53 remission patients and 2 (8.7%) of 23 resistant patients. While 47 (63.5%) cases expressed ABL(Deltaexon7) and 8 (10.8% ) cases expressed ABL(35INS) in 74 healthy people, 30 (56.6%) cases expressed ABL(Deltaexon7) and 5 (9.4% ) cases expressed ABL(35INS) in 53 remission patients, 12 (52.2%) cases expressed ABL(Deltaexon7) and 3(13.0%) cases expressed ABL(35INS) in 23 resistant patients. Three kinds of spliceosome in all groups had no statistical difference. CONCLUSION: ABL(Deltaexon7+ 35INS), ABL(Deltaexon7) and ABL(35INS) may be not uncommon in ABL gene and were unrelated to resistance in CML with TKIs treatment.

METHODS: Newly diagnosed Ph (-) ALL patients with bone marrow morphology analysis on day 14 during induction chemotherapy were analyzed retrospectively. The proportion of the D14 blasts which had an impact on achieving a CR by the first induction chemotherapy and outcomes were determined by ROC curve. RESULTS: 166 ALL patients including 94 male and 72 female were analyzed. The median age was 32 years (range, 18-64 years). The CR rate by the first induction chemotherapy was 74.7% with a total CR rate as 93.3%. By ROC analysis, 7.5% of the D14 blasts had the best sensitivity and specificity. The patients with D14 blasts >/=7.5% had lower CR rates after the first and overall induction chemotherapy compared with those with D14 blasts <7.5% (42.7% vs 85.9%, P<0.001 and 75.9% vs 95.6%, P=0.001 respectively).

METHODS: The clinical data of 23 MCL patients were retrospectively analyzed. Immunohistochemical stain was performed to detect the protein expressions of Mcl-1, pNF-kappaB p65 and 14-3-3zeta of MCL patients to analyze its prognostic factors. RESULTS: Among 23 MCL patients, there were 17(73.9%) patients with IPI 0-2 (low risk group) and 6(26.1%) patients with IPI 3-4. Only the rate of 2y-progression-free survival (PFS) of group IPI 0-2 was superior to that of group IPI 3-4 patients (47.1% vs 0, P=0.049); There were 16 (69.5%) patients with MIPI < 5.7, whose rates of overall response rate (ORR), 2y overall survival (OS) and PFS were better than those of the ones with MIPI >/= 5.7(ORR: 81.3% vs 33.3% P=0.032; OS: 68.8% vs 16.7% P=0.041; PFS: 50% vs 0, P=0.040 respectively).

RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 1 091(20-3 024) days after transplantation. The 3-year OS and DFS rates were 77.1% (95%CI 71.2%-83.8%), 73.7% (95%CI 67.2%-80.3%), respectively. 3-year DFS for patients needed less than 200 days to attain minimal residual disease (MRD) </=0.03% was significantly higher than that of patients required 200 days or more (88.9% vs 46.9%, P=0.042). 3-year DFS for patients with constant MRD negative 90.0% was greater than that of the remaining group 61.1% , but the difference was insignificant (P=0.090). A multivariate analysis of risk factors for relapse identified days from diagnosis to MRD negative was the only independent factor [RR=0.022 (95% CI 0.001-0.604), P=0.024].

Eradication of quiescent LSCs is a promising approach to prevent recurrence of CML. Here we report on new biophysical differences between quiescent and proliferating CD34+ LSCs, and speculate how this information could be of use to eradicate quiescent LSCs. Using AFM measurements on cells collected from four untreated CML patients, substantial differences are observed between quiescent and proliferating cells in the elastic modulus, pericellular brush length and its grafting density at the single cell level.

Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression has been shown to have a role in CLL pathogenesis; however, a comparison of miRNA expression between CLL cells in the LN and the peripheral blood (PB) has previously not been reported. On the basis of the analysis of 17 paired LN and PB samples from CLL patients, we identify a panel of miRNAs that are increased in LN CLL cells correlating with an activation phenotype. When evaluated in CLL cells from 38 patients pre and post treatment with ibrutinib, a subset of these miRNAs (miR-22, miR-34a, miR-146b and miR-181b) was significantly decreased in response to ibrutinib. A concomitant increase in putative miRNA target transcripts (ARID1B, ARID2, ATM, CYLD, FOXP1, HDAC1, IBTK, PTEN and SMAD4) was also observed. Functional studies confirmed targets of ibrutinib-responsive miRNAs to include messenger RNA transcripts of multiple tumor suppressors. Knockdown of endogenous miR-34a and miR146b resulted in increased transcription of tumor suppressors and inhibition of cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate that ibrutinib downregulates the expression of a subset of miRNAs related to B-cell activation leading to increased expression of miRNA targets including tumor suppressors and a reduction in cell proliferation.",,"['Saleh, L M', 'Wang, W', 'Herman, S E M', 'Saba, N S', 'Anastas, V', 'Barber, E', 'Corrigan-Cummins, M', 'Farooqui, M', 'Sun, C', 'Sarasua, S M', 'Zhao, Z', 'Abousamra, N K', 'Elbaz, O', 'Abdelghaffar, H A', 'Wiestner, A', 'Calvo, K R']","['Saleh LM', 'Wang W', 'Herman SE', 'Saba NS', 'Anastas V', 'Barber E', 'Corrigan-Cummins M', 'Farooqui M', 'Sun C', 'Sarasua SM', 'Zhao Z', 'Abousamra NK', 'Elbaz O', 'Abdelghaffar HA', 'Wiestner A', 'Calvo KR']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Greenwood Genetic Center, Greenwood, SC and School of Nursing, Clemson University, Clemson, SC, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology Department, Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160624,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/genetics/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics']",,2016/07/20 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016181 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.181 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):340-349. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.181.

Although some transcription factors (TFs) involved in cerebral ischemia, systematic surveys of their changes during ischemic brain injury have not been reported. Moreover, some multi-target agents effectively protected against ischemic stroke, but their mechanisms, especially the targets of TFs, are still unclear. Therefore, a comprehensive approach by integrating network pharmacology strategy and a new concatenated tandem array of consensus transcription factor response elements method to systematically investigate the target TFs critical in the protection against cerebral ischemia by a medication was first reported, and then applied to a multi-target drug, Danhong injection (DHI). High-throughput nature and depth of coverage, as well as high quantitative accuracy of the developed approach, make it more suitable for analyzing such multi-target agents. Results indicated that pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 and cyclic AMP-dependent transcription factor 1, along with six other TFs, are putative target TFs for DHI-mediated protection against cerebral ischemia.

However, a subset of patients develops resistance to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), mainly due to point mutations in the region encoding the kinase domain of the fused BCR-ABL oncogene. To identify potential therapeutic targets in imatinibresistant CML cells, we derived imatinib-resistant CML-T1 human cell line clone (CML-T1/IR) by prolonged exposure to imatinib in growth media. Mutational analysis revealed that the Y235H mutation in BCR-ABL is probably the main cause of CML-T1/IR resistance to imatinib. To identify alternative therapeutic targets for selective elimination of imatinib-resistant cells, we compared the proteome profiles of CML-T1 and CML-T1/IR cells using 2-DE-MS. We identified eight differentially expressed proteins, with strongly upregulated Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) in the resistant cells, suggesting that this protein may influence cytosolic pH, Ca2+ concentration or signaling pathways such as Wnt in CML-T1/IR cells. We tested several compounds including drugs in clinical use that interfere with the aforementioned processes and tested their relative toxicity to CML-T1 and CML-T1/IR cells. Calcium channel blockers, calcium signaling antagonists and modulators of calcium homeostasis, namely thapsigargin, ionomycin, verapamil, carboxyamidotriazole and immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporine A and tacrolimus (FK-506) were selectively toxic to CML-T1/IR cells. The putative cellular targets of these compounds in CML-T1/IR cells are postulated in this study. We propose that Ca2+ homeostasis can be a potential therapeutic target in CML cells resistant to TKIs. We demonstrate that a proteomic approach may be used to characterize a TKI-resistant population of CML cells enabling future individualized treatment options for patients.",,"['Toman, O', 'Kabickova, T', 'Vit, O', 'Fiser, R', 'Polakova, K Machova', 'Zach, J', 'Linhartova, J', 'Vyoral, D', 'Petrak, J']","['Toman O', 'Kabickova T', 'Vit O', 'Fiser R', 'Polakova KM', 'Zach J', 'Linhartova J', 'Vyoral D', 'Petrak J']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'BIOCEV, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, CZ-25250 Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Genetics and Microbiology, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Charles University in Prague, CZ-12843 Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, CZ-12820 Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160718,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proteome)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'Homeostasis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mutation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proteome/*metabolism', 'Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC4968618,2016/07/20 06:00,2017/03/09 06:00,['2016/07/20 06:00'],"['2016/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2016.4945 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Sep;36(3):1258-68. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.4945.

To solve these problems, a chemosensitization agent can be applied to increase the susceptibility of these cells to ATO. Curcumin (CUR), which possesses a wide range of anticancer activities, is a commonly used chemosensitization agent for various types of tumors, including hematopoietic malignancies. In the present study, we investigated the cytotoxic effects and potential mechanisms in MDS-SKM-1 and leukemia stem-like KG1a cells treated with CUR and ATO alone or in combination. CUR and ATO exhibited growth inhibition detected by MTT assays and apoptosis analyzed by Annexin V/PI analyses in both SKM-1 and KG1a cells. Apoptosis of SKM-1 and KG1a cells determined by Annexin V/PI was significantly enhanced in the combination groups compared with the groups treated with either agent alone. Further evaluation was performed by western blotting for two hallmark markers of apoptosis, caspase-3 and cleaved-PARP. Co-treatment of the cells with CUR and ATO resulted in significant synergistic effects. In SKM-1 and KG1a cells, 31 and 13 proteins analyzed by protein array assays were modulated, respectively. Notably, survivin protein expression levels were downregulated in both cell lines treated with CUR alone and in combination with ATO, particularly in the latter case. Susceptibility to apoptosis was significantly increased in SKM-1 and KG1a cells treated with siRNA-survivin and ATO. These results suggested that CUR increased the sensitivity of SKM-1 and KG1a cells to ATO by downregulating the expression of survivin.",,"['Zeng, Yingjian', 'Weng, Guangyang', 'Fan, Jiaxin', 'Li, Zhangqiu', 'Wu, Jianwei', 'Li, Yuanming', 'Zheng, Rong', 'Xia, Pingfang', 'Guo, Kunyuan']","['Zeng Y', 'Weng G', 'Fan J', 'Li Z', 'Wu J', 'Li Y', 'Zheng R', 'Xia P', 'Guo K']",,"['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Jiangmen Traditional Chinese Medical Hospital of Jinan University, Jiangmen, Guangdong 529000, P.R.

The secretory activity of chondrocytes is usually studied in cell cultures and may differ from that in intact cartilage. According to McCutchen's theory of 'weeping' joint lubrication, loading of the articular cartilage during motion squeezes the fluid with lubricating properties from the cartilage. The purpose of the study was to obtain cartilage interstitial fluid (CIF) from intact cartilage and to evaluate its influence on gene expression in the synovial membrane cells. CIF was rinsed out from the cartilage of newborn rats at a pressure of three bar. The chondrocytes survived rinsing and grew in culture. Cytokines in CIF were detected using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The influence of CIF and CIF-like cocktail (all cytokines found in CIF) on gene expression in the synovial membrane cells was studied after a 4 h-incubation, by real-time PCR. Data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon matched-pair test or by the MannWhitney U test. CIF contained basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF)1, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1), bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7), macrophage (M)-colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte (G)-CSF and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). CIF stimulated the expression of hyaluronan synthase (HAS)1 and 2, lubricin, collagen I, versican, aggrecan, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)2 and 3, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) 1-3, interleukin (IL)-6 and TGFbeta1, and decreased the expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and IL-1beta.

These differences were statistically significant both after 2 and 4weeks from CLL cells injection. In addition comparison of mice treated with rituximab with untreated controls for changes in spleen iron uptake confirmed that it is possible to monitor treatment efficacy in this mouse model of CLL using USPIO-enhanced MRI.

One such locus resides in LNK/SH2B3, which in mice is expressed in hematopoietic cells and suppresses thrombopoietin signaling via its receptor myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene. However, the mechanisms underlying the association of LNK single-nucleotide polymorphisms with coronary heart disease are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To understand the functional effects of LNK single-nucleotide polymorphisms and explore the mechanisms whereby LNK loss of function impacts atherosclerosis and thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using human cord blood, we show that the common TT risk genotype (R262W) of LNK is associated with expansion of hematopoietic stem cells and enhanced megakaryopoiesis, demonstrating reduced LNK function and increased myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene signaling. In mice, hematopoietic Lnk deficiency leads to accelerated arterial thrombosis and atherosclerosis, but only in the setting of hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia acts synergistically with LNK deficiency to increase interleukin 3/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor signaling in bone marrow myeloid progenitors, whereas in platelets cholesterol loading combines with Lnk deficiency to increase activation. Platelet LNK deficiency increases myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene signaling and AKT activation, whereas cholesterol loading decreases SHIP-1 phosphorylation, acting convergently to increase AKT and platelet activation. Together with increased myelopoiesis, platelet activation promotes prothrombotic and proatherogenic platelet/leukocyte aggregate formation. CONCLUSIONS: LNK (R262W) is a loss-of-function variant that promotes thrombopoietin/myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene signaling and platelet and leukocyte production. In mice, LNK deficiency is associated with both increased platelet production and activation. Hypercholesterolemia acts in platelets and hematopoietic progenitors to exacerbate thrombosis and atherosclerosis associated with LNK deficiency.","['(c) 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.']","['Wang, Wei', 'Tang, Yang', 'Wang, Ying', 'Tascau, Liana', 'Balcerek, Joanna', 'Tong, Wei', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Welch, Carrie', 'Tall, Alan R', 'Wang, Nan']","['Wang W', 'Tang Y', 'Wang Y', 'Tascau L', 'Balcerek J', 'Tong W', 'Levine RL', 'Welch C', 'Tall AR', 'Wang N']",,"[""From the Division of Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Columbia University, New York, NY (W.W., Y.T., Y.W., L.T., C.W., A.R.T., N.W.);

Previous reviews have focused on the application of AMD3100 in the treatment of HIV, but a comprehensive evaluation of AMD3100 in the treatment of leukemia, solid tumor, and diagnosis is lacking. In this review, we broadly describe AMD3100, including the background, functional mechanism and clinical applications. Until the late 1990s, CXCR4 was known as a crucial factor for hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) retention in bone marrow. Subsequently, the action and synergy of plerixafor with Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) led to the clinical approval of plerixafor as the first compound for mobilization of HSPCs. The amount of HSPC mobilization and the rapid kinetics promoted additional clinical uses. Recently, CXCR4/CXCL12 (C-X-C motif chemokine 12) axis was found to be involved in a variety of roles in tumors, including leukemic stem cell (LSC) homing and signaling transduction. Thus, CXCR4 targeting has been a treatment strategy against leukemia and solid tumors. Understanding this mechanism will help shed light on therapeutic potential for HIV infection, inflammatory diseases, stem-cell mobilization, leukemia, and solid tumors. Clarifying the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis and role of AMD3100 will help remove malignant cells from the bone marrow niche, rendering them more accessible to targeted therapeutic agents.",,"['Liu, Tao', 'Li, Xiaobo', 'You, Shuo', 'Bhuyan, Soumitra S', 'Dong, Lei']","['Liu T', 'Li X', 'You S', 'Bhuyan SS', 'Dong L']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7530-7427'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, 1760 Haygood Drive NE, HSRB E363, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.', ""Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Wuxi, 214400 Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, 1760 Haygood Drive NE, HSRB E363, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory of Molecular Design and Drug Discovery, Tianjin Institute of Pharmaceutical Research, Tianjin, 300193 China.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.', 'School of Public Health, Division of Health Systems, Management, and Policy, The University of Memphis, Memphis, TN 38152 USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Emory University School of Medicine, 1760 Haygood Drive NE, HSRB E363, Atlanta, GA 30322 USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160716,England,Exp Hematol Oncol,Experimental hematology & oncology,101590676,,,,PMC4947283,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/05/25 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40164-016-0050-5 [doi]', '50 [pii]']",epublish,Exp Hematol Oncol. 2016 Jul 16;5:19. doi: 10.1186/s40164-016-0050-5. eCollection 2015.,['NOTNLM'],"['AMD3100', 'Breast cancer', 'Leukemia', 'Plerixafor', 'Tumor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

QS mechanisms also have a role in higher organisms in maintaining homeostasis, regulation of the immune system and collective behavior of cancer cell populations. In the present study, we used a p190(BCR-ABL) driven pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL3) cell line derived from the pleural fluid of a terminally ill patient with ALL to test the QS hypothesis in leukemia. ALL3 cells don't grow at low density (LD) in liquid media but grow progressively faster at increasingly high cell densities (HD) in contrast to other established leukemic cell lines that grow well at very low starting cell densities. The ALL3 cells at LD are poised to grow but shortly die without additional stimulation. Supernates of ALL3 cells (HDSN) and some other primary cells grown at HD stimulate the growth of the LD ALL3 cells without which they won't survive. To get further insight into the activation processes we performed microarray analysis of the LD ALL3 cells after stimulation with ALL3 HDSN at days 1, 3, and 6. This screen identified several candidate genes, and we linked them to signaling networks and their functions. We observed that genes involved in lipid, cholesterol, fatty acid metabolism, and B cell activation are most up- or down-regulated upon stimulation of the LD ALL3 cells using HDSN. We also discuss other pathways that are differentially expressed upon stimulation of the LD ALL3 cells. Our findings suggest that the Ph+ ALL population achieves dominance by functioning as a collective aberrant ecosystem subject to defective quorum-sensing regulatory mechanisms.",,"['Patel, Sapan J', 'Dao, Su', 'Darie, Costel C', 'Clarkson, Bayard D']","['Patel SJ', 'Dao S', 'Darie CC', 'Clarkson BD']",,"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Molecular Pharmacology Program1275 York Avenue, Box #96, New York, NY 10065, USA; Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Biochemistry and Proteomics Group, Clarkson University8 Clarkson Avenue, Potsdam, NY 13699-5810, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Molecular Pharmacology Program 1275 York Avenue, Box #96, New York, NY 10065, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biomolecular Science, Biochemistry and Proteomics Group, Clarkson University 8 Clarkson Avenue, Potsdam, NY 13699-5810, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Molecular Pharmacology Program 1275 York Avenue, Box #96, New York, NY 10065, USA.']",['eng'],['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20160601,United States,Am J Cancer Res,American journal of cancer research,101549944,,,,PMC4937729,2016/07/19 06:00,2016/07/19 06:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Cancer Res. 2016 Jun 1;6(6):1177-230. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'FAM129C', 'cancer cell population', 'cancer ecosystem', 'cholesterol metabolism', 'hallmark of cancer', 'quorum sensing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After more than two decades without effective chemotherapeutic options and a dismal prognosis of less than 5 years, only the introduction of interferonalpha (IFNalpha) allowed for response rates between 80-90 % and survival improvement. Nowadays, however, patients are rarely treated with IFN-alpha as purine analogues were found to be highly effective in HCL facilitating a near normal life span in most cases. Moreover, novel therapeutic tools for patients with relapsed or refractory disease after purine analogues have emerged such as rituximab and, more recently, vemurafenib. In the absence of long-term safety data for these novel agents, however, IFN-alpha may still represent a viable therapeutic option when the profound immunosuppressive side effects of purine analogues are to be avoided. We herein report a HCL patient, who has received multiple lines of therapy, including pentostatin, cladribine, and a total of 164 months of treatment with IFNalpha yielding long-term disease control. Our case illustrates that long-term administration of IFN-alpha with adequate dose-adjustments according to toxicity and disease activity is feasible in HCL and may still be a viable therapeutic option when purine analogues are considered unsuitable.",,"['Bohn, Jan-Paul', 'Gastl, Guenther', 'Steurer, Michael']","['Bohn JP', 'Gastl G', 'Steurer M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Anichstrasse 35, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Anichstrasse 35, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V, Medical University of Innsbruck, Anichstrasse 35, 6020 Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160617,Austria,Memo,Memo,101467972,,,,PMC4923076,2016/07/19 06:00,2016/07/19 06:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12254-016-0269-1 [doi]', '269 [pii]']",ppublish,Memo. 2016;9:63-65. doi: 10.1007/s12254-016-0269-1.

Six days after EAE induction, F3 or F3.olig2 cells (1 x 10(6)/mouse) were intravenously transplanted. MOG-injected mice displayed severe neurobehavioral deficits which were remarkably attenuated and restored by cell transplantation, in which F3.olig2 cells were superior to its parental F3 cells. Transplanted cells migrated to the injured spinal cord, matured to oligodendrocytes, and produced myelin basic proteins (MBP). The F3.olig2 cells expressed growth and neurotrophic factors including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), nerve growth factor (NGF), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). In addition, the transplanted cells markedly attenuated inflammatory cell infiltration, reduced cytokine levels in the spinal cord and lymph nodes, and protected host myelins.

METHODS: NB4 cells were treated with LG268 for 24 h or 48 h. The effect of LG268 on cell proliferation was assessed by the CCK-8 assay and colony-forming assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of Survivin, PARP, c-Myc, cyclin D1, ERK, p-ERK, p38 MAPK, and p- p38 MAPK were detected by western blot. RESULTS: We found that LG268 inhibited the proliferation of NB4 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometry analysis showed that LG268 accelerated apoptosis in NB4 cells in a time- dependent manner and that LG268 treatment led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase. Moreover, LG268 significantly decreased the protein levels of Survivin, c-Myc, and cyclinD1. Cleaved PARP was observed in the LG268 treatment group but not in the control group. In addition, LG268 increased the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK and decreased the phosphorylation level of ERK.

Fifty-three patients received CsA+MTX while 24 received CsA+MMF.

Recurrent gene mutations and fusions were tested in an additional 87 adult and 93 pediatric patients. Among the 29 newly identified in-frame gene fusions, those involving MEF2D and ZNF384 were clinically relevant and were demonstrated to perturb B-cell differentiation, with EP300-ZNF384 inducing leukemia in mice. Eight gene expression subgroups associated with characteristic genetic abnormalities were identified, including leukemia with MEF2D and ZNF384 fusions in two distinct clusters. In subgroup G4 which was characterized by ERG deletion, DUX4-IGH fusion was detected in most cases. This comprehensive dataset allowed us to compare the features of molecular pathogenesis between adult and pediatric B-ALL and to identify signatures possibly related to the inferior outcome of adults to that of children. We found that, besides the known discrepancies in frequencies of prognostic markers, adult patients had more cooperative mutations and greater enrichment for alterations of epigenetic modifiers and genes linked to B-cell development, suggesting difference in the target cells of transformation between adult and pediatric patients and may explain in part the disparity in their responses to treatment.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Small DOK1 variants remain in cells of solid tumors and leukemias, albeit, their functions are elusive. To assess the so far unknown role of DOK1 in colorectal cancer (CRC), we generated DOK1 mutants which mimic the domain structure and subcellular distribution of DOK1 protein variants in leukemia patients. We found that cytoplasmic DOK1 activated peroxisome-proliferator-activated-receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) resulting in inhibition of the c-FOS promoter and cell proliferation, whereas nuclear DOK1 was inactive. PPARgamma-agonist increased expression of endogenous DOK1 and interaction with PPARgamma. Forward translation of this cell-based signaling model predicted compartmentalization of DOK1 in patients. In a large series of CRC patients, loss of DOK1 protein was associated with poor prognosis at early tumor stages (*p=0.001; n=1492). In tumors with cytoplasmic expression of DOK1, survival was improved, whereas nuclear localization of DOK1 correlated with poor outcome, indicating that compartmentalization of DOK1 is critical for CRC progression. Thus, DOK1 was identified as a prognostic factor for non-metastatic CRC, and, via its drugability by PPARgamma-agonist, may constitute a potential target for future cancer treatments.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Core binding factor is a heterodimeric transcription factor comprised of one of 3 RUNX proteins (RUNX1-3) and a CBFbeta binding partner. CBFbeta enhances DNA binding of RUNX subunits by relieving auto-inhibition. Both RUNX1 and CBFbeta are frequently mutated in human leukemia. More recently, RUNX proteins have been shown to be key players in epithelial cancers, suggesting the targeting of this pathway could have broad utility. In order to test this, we developed small molecules which bind to CBFbeta and inhibit its binding to RUNX. Treatment with these inhibitors reduces binding of RUNX1 to target genes, alters the expression of RUNX1 target genes, and impacts cell survival and differentiation. These inhibitors show efficacy against leukemia cells as well as basal-like (triple-negative) breast cancer cells. These inhibitors provide effective tools to probe the utility of targeting RUNX transcription factor function in other cancers.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

We have evaluated progression rates in a decentralised healthcare setting and characterised patients progressing to AP/BC on TKI treatment. METHODS: Using data from the Swedish CML register, we identified CP-CML patients diagnosed 2007-2011 who progressed to AP/BC within 2 yrs from diagnosis (n = 18) as well as patients diagnosed in advanced phase during 2007-2012 (n = 36) from a total of 544 newly diagnosed CML cases. We evaluated baseline characteristics, progression rates, outcome and adherence to guidelines for monitoring and treatment. RESULTS: The cumulative progression rate at 2 yrs was 4.3%. All 18 progression cases had been treated with imatinib, and six progressed within 6 months. High-risk EUTOS score was associated to a higher risk of progression. Insufficient cytogenetic and/or molecular monitoring was found in 33%. Median survival after transformation during TKI treatment was 1.4 yrs. In those presenting with BC and AP, median survival was 1.6 yrs and not reached, respectively. CONCLUSION: In this population-based setting, progression rates appear comparable to that reported from clinical trials, with similar dismal patient outcome.

These models were limited by their inability to transplant clinically aggressive disease. Second, we established three patient-derived xenograft models of human t-AML. These models led to rapidly fatal disease in recipient immunodeficient xenografted mice.

However, outcomes of HCT performed for AML not in remission are historically poor given high relapse rates and transplant-related mortality. Preliminary studies suggest conditioning with clofarabine and myeloablative busulfan (CloBu4) may exert significant anti-leukemic effects without excessive toxicity in refractory hematologic malignancies. A prospective multicenter phase II trial was conducted to determine the efficacy of CloBu4 for patients proceeding directly to HCT with AML not in remission. Seventy-one patients (median age: 56 years) received CloBu4. At day 30 after HCT, 90% achieved morphologic remission. The incidence of non-relapse mortality and relapse at 2 years was 25% and 55%, respectively. The 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) were 26% and 20%, respectively.

These studies, however, typically have small sample sizes, short-term follow ups or a limited panel of medical covariates. We extend this research in a large, well-characterized sample of transplant patients, asking whether patients' perceived emotional support and psychological distress predict mortality over 2 years. Prior to transplant, 400 cancer patients (55.5% males; 82.8% White; Mage=50.0 years; 67.0% leukemia, 20.0% lymphoma) were interviewed by a social caseworker, who documented the patients' perceived emotional support and psychological distress. Subsequently, patients received an allogeneic HSCT (51.0% matched-related donor, 42.0% matched-unrelated donor and 7.0% cord blood). HSCT outcomes were obtained from medical records. Controlling for demographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity and marital status) and medical confounders (disease type, conditioning regimen, remission status, cell dosage, donor and recipient CMV seropositivity, donor sex, comorbidities and disease risk), ratings of good emotional support pre-transplant predicted longer overall survival (hazard ratio (HR)=0.61, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.42-0.91; P=0.013). Pre-transplant psychological distress was unrelated to survival, however (Ps>0.58). Emotional support was marginally associated with lower rates of treatment-related mortality (HR=0.58, CI, 0.32-1.05; P=0.073). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional support contributes to better outcomes following HSCT. Future studies should examine whether intervention efforts to optimize emotional resources can improve survival in cancer patients.",,"['Ehrlich, K B', 'Miller, G E', 'Scheide, T', 'Baveja, S', 'Weiland, R', 'Galvin, J', 'Mehta, J', 'Penedo, F J']","['Ehrlich KB', 'Miller GE', 'Scheide T', 'Baveja S', 'Weiland R', 'Galvin J', 'Mehta J', 'Penedo FJ']",,"['Department of Psychology and Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Psychology and Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Northwestern Memorial Hospital, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Psychology and Institute for Policy Research, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medical Social Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160718,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Caregivers/*psychology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*psychology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Social Support', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Survival Rate']",,2016/07/19 06:00,2017/12/13 06:00,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2015/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016191 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.191 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2016 Dec;51(12):1594-1598. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.191.

Mice hemizygous for Crebbp develop myelodysplasia with proliferative features, reminiscent of human MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasm-unclassifiable (MDS/MPN-U), and a proportion goes on to develop acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We have also shown that the Crebbp+/- non-hematopoietic bone marrow microenvironment induces excessive myeloproliferation of wild-type cells. We now report that transplantation of unfractionated Crebbp+/- bone marrow into wild-type recipients resulted in either early-onset AML or late-onset MDS and MDS/MPN-U. In contrast, purified Lin-Sca-1+c-Kit++ cells primarily gave rise to MDS with occasional transformation to AML. Furthermore, Crebbp+/- common myeloid progenitors and granulocyte/macrophage progenitors could trigger skewed myelopoiesis, myelodysplasia and late-onset AML. Surprisingly, the phenotypically abnormal cells were all of wild-type origin. MDS, MPN and AML can thus all be transferred from Crebbp+/- BM to wild-type hosts but fractionated bone marrow does not recapitulate the full disease spectrum of whole bone marrow, indicating that not only mutational status but also cellular context contribute to disease outcome.

Therefore, they are not able to discriminate between myeloid or lymphoid blast cell lineages. The objective of the proposed work is to achieve automatic discrimination of reactive lymphoid cells (RLC), lymphoid and myeloid blast cells and to obtain their morphologic patterns through feature analysis. METHODS: In the training stage, a set of 696 blood cell images was selected in 32 patients (myeloid acute leukemia, lymphoid precursor neoplasms and viral or other infections). For classification, we used support vector machines, testing different combinations of feature categories and feature selection techniques. Further, a validation was implemented using the selected features over 220 images from 15 new patients (five corresponding to each category). RESULTS: Best discrimination accuracy in the training was obtained with feature selection from the whole feature set (90.1%). We selected 60 features, showing significant differences (P < 0.001) in the mean values of the different cell groups. Nucleus-cytoplasm ratio was the most important feature for the cell classification, and color-texture features from the cytoplasm were also important. In the validation stage, the overall classification accuracy and the true-positive rates for RLC, myeloid and lymphoid blast cells were 80%, 85%, 82% and 74%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The methodology appears to be able to recognize reactive lymphocytes well, especially between reactive lymphocytes and lymphoblasts.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Bigorra, Laura', 'Merino, Anna', 'Alferez, Santiago', 'Rodellar, Jose']","['Bigorra L', 'Merino A', 'Alferez S', 'Rodellar J']",,"['Hemotherapy-Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, CDB, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hemotherapy-Hemostasis, Hospital Clinic de Barcelona, CDB, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CoDAlab, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",20160718,United States,J Clin Lab Anal,Journal of clinical laboratory analysis,8801384,,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/pathology', 'Humans', 'Image Cytometry/*instrumentation/methods', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/*instrumentation/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphocytes/classification/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/classification/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Support Vector Machine']",PMC6817297,2016/07/19 06:00,2017/05/24 06:00,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcla.22024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Lab Anal. 2017 Mar;31(2). doi: 10.1002/jcla.22024.

To better understand the mechanisms of 2HG pathophysiology, we introduced the analogous glioma-associated mutations into the NADP(+ )isocitrate dehydrogenase genes (IDP1, IDP2, IDP3) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Intriguingly, expression of the mitochondrial IDP1(R148H) mutant allele results in high levels of 2HG production as well as extensive mtDNA loss and respiration defects. We find no evidence for a reactive oxygen-mediated mechanism mediating this mtDNA loss. Instead, we show that 2HG production perturbs the iron sensing mechanisms as indicated by upregulation of the Aft1-controlled iron regulon and a concomitant increase in iron levels. Accordingly, iron chelation, or overexpression of a truncated AFT1 allele that dampens transcription of the iron regulon, suppresses the loss of respirative capacity. Additional suppressing factors include overexpression of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase gene ALD5 or disruption of the retrograde response transcription factor RTG1 Furthermore, elevated alpha-ketoglutarate levels also suppress 2HG-mediated respiration loss; consistent with a mechanism by which 2HG contributes to mtDNA loss by acting as a toxic alpha-ketoglutarate analog.

However, little is known on association between MRD status and germline genetic variation. We examined 159 Caucasian (Slavic) patients with pediatric ALL, treated according to ALL-IC-BFM 2002/2009 protocols, in search for association between 23 germline polymorphisms and MRD status at day 15, day 33 and week 12, with adjustment for MRD-associated clinical covariates. Three variants were significantly associated with MRD: rs1544410 in VDR (MRD-day15); rs1051266 in RFC (MRD-day33, MRD-week12), independently and in an additive effect with rs10519613 in IL15 (MRD-day33). The risk alleles for MRD-positivity were: A allele of VDR (OR = 2.37, 95%CI = 1.07-5.21, P = 0.03, MRD-day15); A of RFC (OR = 1.93, 95%CI = 1.05-3.52, P = 0.03, MRD-day33 and MRD-week12, P < 0.01); A of IL15 (OR = 2.30, 95%CI = 1.02-5.18, P = 0.04, MRD-day33).

To explore the contribution of diminished deformability and increased fragility to these in vivo phenomena, iron status was correlated with the corresponding in vitro measurements using ektacytometry on whole erythrocytes or resealed ghost membranes. Compared to normal controls (Group 1: n = 15), those with iron deficiency of unknown origin (Group 2: n = 15), or when associated with primary proliferative polycythemia (Group 3: n = 20), were significantly less deformable and more fragile, whereas the latter category of patients, who were not anaemic (Group 4: n = 33), occupied an intermediate position. These observations support the contention that shortened intramedullary and extramedullary lifespan is contributed to by the altered physical characteristics of the red cell membrane. This observation is therapeutically important since the lesion can be readily corrected by oral iron supplementation which, at the same time, reverses the symptoms of the anaemia and prevents the development of paradoxical hyperviscosity. Additionally, it is speculated that the risk of thrombotic events in the polycythemic group may be reduced, since these appear to occur more frequently in the face of depleted body iron stores.",,"['Anderson, C', 'Aronson, I', 'Jacobs, P']","['Anderson C', 'Aronson I', 'Jacobs P']",,"['a The Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology , University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital , Observatory , Cape Town , 8000 , South Africa.', 'a The Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology , University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital , Observatory , Cape Town , 8000 , South Africa.', 'a The Leukaemia Centre and the Department of Haematology , University of Cape Town and Groote Schuur Hospital , Observatory , Cape Town , 8000 , South Africa.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1999/01/01 00:00,1999/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1999.11746471 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1999;4(5):457-60. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1999.11746471.,['NOTNLM'],"['Iron deficient', 'arterial thrombosis', 'ektacytometry', 'increased fragmentation', 'paradoxical hyperviscosity', 'reduced deformability']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It typically affects males, causes marked splenomegaly and moderate enlargement of the liver, whilst lymphadenopathy is inconspicuous. Pancytopenia is characteristic with unusually profound monocytopenia, variable reduction in platelets, and the presence in the peripheral blood and marrow of abnormal small lymphocytes having irregular cytoplasmic margins. Ultrastructure, combined with cytochemistry and flow cytometry, have refined diagnosis. A variant exists between this classical entity and B prolymphocytic leukaemia, where blastic transformation or massive lymph node enlargement are found, and this is of ominous significance. In all these patients with this entity conventional chemotherapy is ineffective and shortens survival. Our previous experience with splenectomy results in excellent clinical control for long periods of time, but without disease eradication. There followed a vogue for the use of interferon but this is limited by high cost and dose-dependent side-effects. Contemporary management centres on the purine analogues, where durable responses are possible with fludarabine and deoxycoformycin, but best with 2'chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA). To document the efficacy of the latter agent, we analysed the outcome in seventeen consecutive patients treated over the last five years. Four were ineligible for analysis, although two had 2-CDA. The other thirteen, managed on a standard seven-day course of 0.1 mg/kg 2-CDA given as a continuous intravenous infusion, all responded promptly. Apart from transient leucopenia complications have been minimal, and oral co-trimoxazole prophylaxis for pneumocystis carinii was maintained during the first one year. In all thirteen there was a rapid return to normal of peripheral blood count and marrow on aspiration and trephine biopsy. Even in the longest follow-up clinical and haematologic remission has been maintained and no patients have required retreatment. One individual has relapsed in the marrow at two years. Despite the relative expense of the agent the excellent treatment outcome and patient acceptability, coupled with its safety, leads to the recommendation that in South Africa-as elsewhere in the world-this be regarded as the first line of treatment.",,"['Jacobs, P', 'Wood, L', 'Mansvelt, E P', 'Gartrell, K']","['Jacobs P', 'Wood L', 'Mansvelt EP', 'Gartrell K']",,"['a The Department of Haematology and the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit , Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic , Burnham Road, Plumstead 7800 , Cape Town , South Africa.', 'a The Department of Haematology and the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit , Constantiaberg Medi-Clinic , Burnham Road, Plumstead 7800 , Cape Town , South Africa.', 'b The Department of Haematological Pathology , University of Stellenbosch and Tygerberg Academic Hospital , Private Bag X3, Tygerberg 7505 , Cape, South Africa.', 'b The Department of Haematological Pathology , University of Stellenbosch and Tygerberg Academic Hospital , Private Bag X3, Tygerberg 7505 , Cape, South Africa.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1999/01/01 00:00,1999/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '1999/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1999/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1999.11746465 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1999;4(5):403-14. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1999.11746465.,['NOTNLM'],"['2-CDA', 'Hairy cell leukaemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known to be metabolized mostly by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 isoforms while its efflux is mediated by the transporters ABCB1 and ABCG2. Genetic polymorphism of some of these enzymes and transporters have been linked with inter-individual variations in the pharmacokinetics of the drug. This study, therefore, investigated the influence of CYP3A5*3, ABCG2 421C>A and ABCB1 3435 C>T genetic polymorphism on the clinical outcome and steady-state trough plasma concentration (TPC) of imatinib in Nigerians with CML. METHODS: A total of 110 Nigerians with CML each of whom had been receiving a 400 mg daily dose of imatinib for at least 1 month were genotyped for CYP3A5*3, ABCG2 421C>A and ABCB1 3435 C>T. The TPC of all the patients were determined by a validated HPLC method and possible relationships between genotypes, age, clinical outcome, sex, TPC and ethnicity were analysed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Subjects of TT genotype of ABCB1 C3435T had higher frequencies of complete haematological response (CHR), complete cytogenetic response (CCR) and major molecular response (MMR) but these were not statistically significant (P < 0.05). No genetic polymorphism in ABCG2 421C>A was observed. However, significant associations were observed between TPC and various genotypes in both CYP3A5*3 (P < 0.001) and ABCB1 C3435T (P < 0.001). The GG and TT genotypes in CYP3A5*3 and ABCB1 C3435T, respectively, were linked with higher TPC. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: This is the first pharmacogenetics study of CML patients in the Nigerian population with ethnic differences in the distribution of ABCB1 C3435T.

Both hematopoietic stem cells and mature cells have the same genome, but their gene expression is controlled by an additional layer of epigenetics such as DNA methylation and post-translational histone modifications, enabling each cell-type to acquire various forms and functions. Until recently, several studies have largely focussed on the transcription factors andniche factors for the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which hematopoietic cells replicate and differentiate. Several lines of emerging evidence suggest that epigenetic modifications eventually result in a defined chromatin structure and an ""individual"" gene expression pattern, which play an essential role in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Distinct epigenetic marks decide which sets of genes may be expressed and which genes are kept silent. Epigenetic mechanisms are interdependent and ensure lifelong production of blood and bone marrow, thereby contributing to stem cell homeostasis. The epigenetic analysis of hematopoiesis raises the exciting possibility that chromatin structure is dynamic enough for regulated expression of genes. Though controlled chromatin accessibility plays an essential role in maintaining blood homeostasis; mutations in chromatin impacts on the regulation of genes critical to the development of leukemia. In this review, we explored the contribution of epigenetic machinery which has implications for the ramification of molecular details of hematopoietic self-renewal for normal development and underlying events that potentially co-operate to induce leukemia.",,"['Sharma, Shilpa', 'Gurudutta, Gangenahalli']","['Sharma S', 'Gurudutta G']",,"['Division of Stem Cell Gene Therapy Research, Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS), Delhi, India.', 'Division of Stem Cell Gene Therapy Research, Institute of Nuclear Medicine & Allied Sciences (INMAS), Delhi, India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Korea (South),Int J Stem Cells,International journal of stem cells,101497587,,,,PMC4961102,2016/07/19 06:00,2016/07/19 06:01,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2015/12/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/19 06:01 [medline]']","['ijsc.2016.9.1.36 [pii]', '10.15283/ijsc.2016.9.1.36 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Stem Cells. 2016 May 30;9(1):36-43. doi: 10.15283/ijsc.2016.9.1.36.,['NOTNLM'],"['Epigenetics', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Regulation', 'Self-renewal']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined upon the enforced expression of miR-34a in TIM3 positive leukemia stem cells and study the impact of leukemia stem cells and its metastasis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples were collected from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) children along with controls. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed with TIM3 antibody followed by Sorting of TIM3 positive cells by flow cytometry and the expression level of miR-34a was quantified by qRT-PCR assay. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry in accordance with Sorting of TIM3 positive cells by flow cytometry concludes that the leukemia stem cells (LSC) were present in the samples. Induced expression of miR-34a in TIM3 positive leukemia stem cells (LSC), inhibits the clonogenic expansion, tumor progression and metastasis of leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: The enforced expression of miR-34a in TIM3 positive leukemia stem cells inhibits the leukemia stem cells and its metastasis. Our study illustrates that miR-34a is a key regulator and which will be developed as a novel therapeutic agent against leukemia stem cells (LSC).",,"['Wang, S', 'Wang, T', 'Li, M-Z', 'Cheng, X-L', 'Li, X-L']","['Wang S', 'Wang T', 'Li MZ', 'Cheng XL', 'Li XL']",,"[""Department of Neonatal Medicine, Wuhan Medical $ Health Care Center for Women and Children (Wuhan Children's Hospital Wuhan Women and Children Care Hospital), Wuhan, China. lixiaolan1978@yahoo.com.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Cell Movement/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Stem Cells/metabolism']",,2016/07/19 06:00,2017/08/22 06:00,['2016/07/19 06:00'],"['2016/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/22 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2016 Jul;20(13):2878-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is thought that IDH1 mutants act by inhibiting TET2 to alter DNA methylation, but there are significant unexplained clinical differences between IDH1- and TET2-mutant diseases. We have discovered that mice expressing endogenous mutant IDH1 have reduced numbers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), in contrast to Tet2 knockout (TET2-KO) mice. Mutant IDH1 downregulates the DNA damage (DD) sensor ATM by altering histone methylation, leading to impaired DNA repair, increased sensitivity to DD, and reduced HSC self-renewal, independent of TET2. ATM expression is also decreased in human IDH1-mutated AML. These findings may have implications for treatment of IDH-mutant leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Of those cured, protracted treatments can lead to long-term morbidity or later toxicity and death. Here we describe 2 patients with brain metastases who failed multiple lines of standard chemotherapy and radiation but had complete response to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). CASE 1: A 35-year-old woman presented with choriocarcinoma in the brain, lungs, and subcutaneous tissues 11 months after full-term delivery. Her FIGO risk score was 14. Over 3 years she was treated with EMA-CO, EMA-CE, Taxol, gemcitabine, brain radiation, and excisional craniotomy for recurrent choriocarcinoma. She showed complete response of choriocarcinoma brain metastases following 2 cycles of PLD. She was choriocarcinoma free until her death 9 months later from acute myelogenous leukemia. CASE 2: A 52-year-old multigravid woman presented with choriocarcinoma 3 years following miscarriage. Her FIGO score was 16. Over 18 months she was treated with EMA-CO, TP/TE and IT MTX, and radiation. Her disease proved resistant and midbrain tumor unresectable. She showed complete response to PLD following 3 cycles but ultimately died from neurologic complications.

Changes in CD150 expression level have been reported in association with autoimmunity and with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We characterized the core promoter for SLAMF1 gene in human B-cell lines and explored binding sites for a number of transcription factors involved in B cell differentiation and activation. Mutations of SP1, STAT6, IRF4, NF-kB, ELF1, TCF3, and SPI1/PU.1 sites resulted in significantly decreased promoter activity of varying magnitude, depending on the cell line tested. The most profound effect on the promoter strength was observed upon mutation of the binding site for Early B-cell factor 1 (EBF1). This mutation produced a 10-20 fold drop in promoter activity and pinpointed EBF1 as the master regulator of human SLAMF1 gene in B cells. We also identified three potent transcriptional enhancers in human SLAMF1 locus, each containing functional EBF1 binding sites. Thus, EBF1 interacts with specific binding sites located both in the promoter and in the enhancer regions of the SLAMF1 gene and is critical for its expression in human B cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Here we investigated the antiproliferative activity of the flavonoids isolated from Baccharis scandens against human leukemia cell lines and found that the methoxyflavonoid gardenin B was the most cytotoxic compound against HL-60 and U-937 cells, showing IC50 values between 1.6 and 3.0 muM, but had no significant cytotoxic effects against quiescent or proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These effects on viability were accompanied by the concentration- and time-dependent appearance of apoptosis as evidenced by DNA fragmentation, formation of apoptotic bodies and a sub-G1 ratio increase. Comparative studies with the best-studied bioflavonoid quercetin indicate that gardenin B is a more cytotoxic and more apoptotic inducer than quercetin. Cell death induced by gardenin B was associated with: (i) a significant induction of caspase-2, -3, -8 and -9 activities; (ii) cleavage of the initiator caspases (caspase-2, -8 and -9), of the executioner caspase-3, and of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; and (iii) a concentration-dependent reactive oxygen species generation.

Pulmonary mucormycosis commonly occurs in patients with severe neutropenia. Typically, pulmonary mucormycosis causes tissue necrosis resulting from angioinvasion and subsequent thrombosis, so most cases can occur with necrotizing pneumonia and/or hemoptysis. Some complex cases may invade adjacent organs, such as the mediastinum, pericardium, and chest wall. However, to the best our knowledge there is little known regarding bronchoesophageal fistula due to pulmonary mucormycosis after induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. We present a case report about this unusual presentation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 51-year-old Korean man was diagnosed as having acute myeloid leukemia and received induction chemotherapy. After prolonged severe neutropenia, he complained of coughing with aspiration. Imaging showed a bronchoesophageal fistula with extensive necrotizing pneumonia in the middle and lower lobes of his right lung. Bronchoscopy showed near total tissue necrosis in the middle lobe of his right lung, creating an orifice. A bronchial scope was passed through and was able to be connected with his esophagus; a bronchial wall biopsy was performed. Esophagoscopy revealed a large linear defect of his esophageal wall 30 cm from the incision that may have connected with the bronchus. A bronchial biopsy showed typical hyphae with necrotic tissue, indicating pulmonary mucormycosis. He was given amphotericin B, and a wide excision of lung and esophagus was planned.

Here, we examined receptors of four mammalian species permissive to all X/P-MLVs (Mus dunni, human, rabbit, mink). Interference assays showed the four to be functionally distinct. Preinfection with X-MLVs consistently blocked all nine XPR1-dependent viruses, while preinfection with P-MLVs and wild mouse X/P-MLVs produced distinctive interference patterns in the four cells. These patterns indicate shared usage of independent, but not always fully functional, receptor sites. XPR1 sequence comparisons identified candidate sites in receptor-determining regions that correlate with some interference patterns.

But the detailed molecular mechanism underlying the responses of female reproductive systems to hypoxic stress remains largely unknown. In the present report, we used marine medaka Oryzias melastigma as a model, together with high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, aiming to determine the changes in transcriptional signature in the ovary of marine fish under hypoxic stress. Our result discovered over two hundred differential expressed genes in ovary in response to hypoxia. The bioinformatics analysis together with quantitative RT-PCR validation on the deregulated genes highlighted the dysregulations of a number of female reproductive functions including interruptions of ovarian follicle development, gonad development and steroid metabolic process. Additionally, we revealed that these deregulations are through the modulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).

RESULTS: QOL in children with ALL of the consolidation phase group was significantly decreased compared with that of healthy controls, except in the area of emotional functioning. Regarding the maintenance phase group, QOL impairment was noted in the physical and school functioning, but no differences were noted in social functioning. The off-treatment group had a large effect size only for physical functioning, and the social functioning score was even better in children with ALL than in matched controls.

METHODS: In vitro functional analysis in AML cells and genetic association study were performed. RESULTS: Our functional analysis of SLC29A1 on anticancer effects of AraC showed that cytotoxic effects of AraC in AML cell lines were decreased by the reduction of SLC29A1 expression (P < 0.05). To investigate whether SLC29A1 polymorphisms could affect the achievement of complete remission (CR) in AML, we genotyped a total of six common single nucleotide polymorphisms on SLC29A1 in 103 AML patients, including 17 successes and 86 failures in CR. As a result, rs3734703 in 3'-untranslated region was significantly associated with CR even after correction for multiple testing (Fisher's exact test, P = 0.008; P corr = 0.04). A haplotype, ht3 (A-G-G-T-C-A; frequency = 0.294 in success group; frequency = 0.120 in failure group), also revealed a significant association with CR (P = 0.01; simulated P sim = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although further replication in larger subjects and further functional evaluations are required, our results suggest the contribution of SLC29A1 to cytotoxic effects of AraC.

The cellular biological behaviors, including proliferation, colony-forming ability and apoptosis were tested afterward. RESULTS: Activation of LXR by GW3965 significantly decreased the cell proliferation rates and colony-forming abilities in the Jurkat and SupT1 cells, but increased their apoptosis rates. Western blot assay show that GW3965 treatment dramatically up-regulated the SOCS3 protein in both cell lines, without affecting E2F1, E2F2 and F2F3a expression levels. SOCS3 inhibition by si-RNA transfection, instead of E2F1, E2F2 and F2F3a pathway inhibition, abolished the aforementioned effects of LXR activation on Jurkat and SupT1 cells. CONCLUSION: Our finding suggests that LXR activation regulates leukemic cell fate and biological behavior via SOCS3 pathway, rather than E2F family members.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we report that patients with CTCL show increased IL15 in a clinical stage-dependent manner. Mechanistically, we show that ZEB1 is a transcriptional repressor of IL15 in T cells and that hypermethylation of the ZEB1 binding region within the IL15 promoter, as seen in patients with CTCL, prevents ZEB1 binding and causes increased transcription of IL15 Using a transgenic mouse model of IL15, we provide evidence that overexpression of IL15 induces a spontaneous CTCL that mimics the human neoplasm. Excessive autocrine production of IL15 in T cells inhibits an HDAC1-mediated negative autoregulatory loop, resulting in the upregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC6 and transcriptional induction of the onco-miR-21. Interruption of IL15 downstream signaling with isotype-specific HDAC inhibitors halts (HDAC1) or significantly delays (HDAC6) the progression of CTCL in vivo and provides preclinical evidence supporting a hierarchical model of oncogenic signaling in CTCL. SIGNIFICANCE: To date, CTCL pathogenesis remains unknown, and there are no curative therapies. Our findings not only demonstrate a critical role for IL15-mediated inflammation in cutaneous T-cell lymphomagenesis, but also uncover a new oncogenic regulatory loop in CTCL involving IL15, HDAC1, HDAC6, and miR-21 that shows differential sensitivity to isotype-specific HDAC inhibitors.

Cancer stem cells have been postulated to represent a therapy-refractory reservoir for relapse, but formal proof of this model is lacking. We prospectively characterized leukemia stem cell populations (LSCs) from a well-defined cohort of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at diagnosis and relapse to assess the effect of the disease course on these critical populations. Leukemic samples were collected from patients with newly diagnosed AML before therapy and after relapse, and LSC frequency was assessed by limiting dilution analyses. LSC populations were identified using fluorescent-labeled cell sorting and transplantation into immunodeficient NOD/SCID/interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain null mice. The surface antigen expression profiles of pretherapy and postrelapse LSCs were determined for published LSC markers. We demonstrate a 9- to 90-fold increase in LSC frequency between diagnosis and relapse. LSC activity at relapse was identified in populations of leukemic blasts that did not demonstrate this activity before treatment and relapse. In addition, we describe genetic instability and exceptional phenotypic changes that accompany the evolution of these new LSC populations. This study is the first to characterize the evolution of LSCs in vivo after chemotherapy, identifying a dramatic change in the physiology of primitive AML cells when the disease progresses.

Unfortunately, cancer cells usually develop drug resistance to TRAIL, which is a major obstacle for its clinical application. One promising strategy is co-administrating with sensitizer to overcome cancer cells resistance to TRAIL. Clitocine, a natural amino nucleoside purified from wild mushroom, is recently demonstrated that can induce apoptosis in multidrug-resistant human cancer cells by targeting Mcl-1. In the present study,we found that pretreatment with clitocine dramatically enhances TRAIL lethality in its resistant human colon cancer cells by inducing apoptosis. More importantly, combination of clitocine and TRAIL also effectively inhibits xenograft growth and induces tumor cells apoptosis in athymic mice. The disruption of the binding between Mcl-1 and Bak as well as mitochondrial translocation of Bax mediated by clitocine are identified as the key underlying mechanisms, which leading to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Enforced exogenous Mcl-1 can effectively attenuate clitocine/TRAIL-induced apoptosis by suppressing the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, clitocine regulates Mcl-1 expression at the posttranslational level as no obvious change is observed on mRNA level and proteasome inhibitor MG132 almost blocks the Mcl-1 suppression by clitocine. In fact, more ubiquitinated Mcl-1 was detected under clitocine treatment. Our findings indicate that clitocine is potentially an effective adjuvant agent in TRAIL-based cancer therapy.",,"['Sun, Jian-Guo', 'Ruan, Feng', 'Zeng, Xue-Li', 'Xiang, Jun', 'Li, Xia', 'Wu, Ping', 'Fung, Kwok Pui', 'Liu, Fei-Yan']","['Sun JG', 'Ruan F', 'Zeng XL', 'Xiang J', 'Li X', 'Wu P', 'Fung KP', 'Liu FY']",,"[""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, 88 Jiefang Road, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""School of Biomedical Sciences (SBS), The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong SAR, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhejiang University, Research Centre of Siyuan Natural Pharmacy and Biotoxicology, College of Life Sciences, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, 310058, People's Republic of China. liuf64@zju.edu.cn."", ""Zhejiang University, Joint Centre of Zhejiang University and The Chinese University of Hong Kong on Natural Products and Toxicology Research, Zijinggang Campus, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. liuf64@zju.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidine Nucleosides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '105798-74-1 (clitocine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrimidine Nucleosides/*administration & dosage', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",,2016/07/17 06:00,2018/02/14 06:00,['2016/07/17 06:00'],"['2016/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s10495-016-1273-y [doi]', '10.1007/s10495-016-1273-y [pii]']",ppublish,Apoptosis. 2016 Oct;21(10):1144-57. doi: 10.1007/s10495-016-1273-y.,['NOTNLM'],"['*Apoptosis', '*Clitocine', '*Human colon cancer', '*Mcl-1', '*TRAIL']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the molecular level, this aberration rearranges the gene for the AML1-transcription factor on chromosome 21, which is essential for normal hematopoiesis, to the MTG8 gene on chromosome 8, thereby leading to a specific AML1/MTG8 fusion mRNA. This fusion gene is involved in leukemogenesis presumably by interfering with normal AML1-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML patients with t(8;21) have a favourable response to chemotherapy and a relatively good prognosis after intensive consolidation treatment with high dose AraC or autologous stem cell transplantation. RT-PCR for the specific AML1/MTG8 fusion transcripts can be used for the sensitive detection of residual leukemic cells during and after therapy. However, since a considerable proportion of these patients shows a positive PCR result even in long-term complete hematological remission, the prognostic value of qualitative PCR methods is doubtful. In contrast, quantitative PCR methods might be able to identify patients with a high risk of relapse by serial quantification of minimal residual disease (MRD). Because of its high degree of standardisation and automation, the recently developed real time PCR method can be used for the valid and reproducible detection of MRD in large prospective trials.

Recently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as new gene regulators and prognostic markers in several cancers. In this study, we found that metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression was up-regulated in GBC tissues (P < 0.05). Luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull down assays showed that MALAT1 is a target of miR-363-3p. Real-time quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis indicated that MALAT1 regulated Myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (MCL-1) expression as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-363-3p in GBC cells. Furthermore, MALAT1 silencing decreased GBC cell proliferation and the S phase cell population and induced apoptosis in vitro. In vivo, tumour volumes were significantly decreased in the MALAT1 silencing group compared with those in the control group. These data demonstrated that the MALAT1/miR-363-3p/MCL-1 regulatory pathway controls the progression of GBC. Inhibition of MALAT1 expression may be to a novel therapeutic strategy for gallbladder cancer.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

MMPs participate in many physiological processes and have also been implicated in various pathological conditions including tumor invasion and metastasis. The functions of MMPs are known to be controlled by mechanisms leading to activation of their latent forms and through inhibition of both active and latent forms by natural tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). The complex relationships between MMPs and TIMPs within the bone marrow microenvironment during normal hematopoiesis as well as during leukemic growth and dissemination have not been extensively investigated. We reported that primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) blasts and leukemic KG-1 cells penetrate reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel) in an in vitro invasion assay, secrete the gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) and express active MMP-2 on the cell surface. We also analyzed MMP/TIMP expression in normal bone marrow cells of the myeloid and stromal lineages and showed that MMP-2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 are produced in the bone marrow microenvironment. Furthermore, we examined the role of gelatinases in the transmigration of stem/progenitor cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood. We found that steady-state bone marrow CD34(+) cells, unlike circulating peripheral blood CD34(+) cells, did not express MMP-2 and MMP-9 mRNA transcripts and proteins, and that various cytokines were able to upregulate expression of these MMPs in bone marrow CD34(+) cells and trans-Matrigel migration of these cells.

The values of the nucleolar coefficient reflecting the number of nucleoli per lymphoblast ranged between 1.66 and 2.03. The slightly larger values of the nucleolar coefficient in T-ALL were not statistically significant in comparison with those in nonT-ALL. Lymphoblasts in the bone marrow as well as the peripheral blood of both nonT and T-ALL patients mostly contained, ""active"" (RNA transcribing) large nucleoli with a relatively uniform distribution of RNA.

In this study we evaluate whether heparin can also induce a naturally occurring programmed cell death in lymphocytes from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a neoplastic lineage where apoptosis is blocked by the expression of the proto-oncogene bc1-2. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) from 7 cases of B-CLL patients in different stages were cultured with three different heparin sodium concentrations for 4 days. Apoptosis was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis and by cytofluorimetric analysis. Bcl-2 expression was tested by flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry on cytospin preparations. Agarose gel electrophoresis showed the characteristic DNA fragmentation pattern of apoptosis in all the cases of B-CLL stage III and IV after heparin incubation. DNA from normal and neoplastic lymphocytes cultured without heparin did not undergo spontaneous apoptosis. Cytofluorimetric analysis confirmed the agarose gel pattern and found a level of apoptosis over 50% after culture of neoplastic PBL with heparin. In these cases bcl-2 expression was found to be significantly reduced after heparin incubation when comparing to bcl-2 level before incubation. Our data adds further evidence regarding the potential role of heparin in oncogene inhibition and in apoptosis induction.

In contrast to these divergent effects on blast proliferation, all three cytokines inhibit constitutive (spontaneous) AML blast cytokine secretion independent of their effects on spontaneous blast proliferation. In the present study we investigated whether the inhibitory effects on AML blast cytokine secretion could be reversed by exogenous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or IL3. Our results demonstrated that IL4/IL10/IL13 inhibited AML blast secretion of IL1beta, IL6 and Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) even in the presence of exogenous G-CSF, GM-CSF and IL3.

BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute leukemia (AL) have been associated with PRRT in heavily pretreated patients with a history of exposure to alkylating agents. Commenced 15 years ago, PRRT is now becoming established as first- and second-line therapy for gastroentero pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEPNETs), and early treatment minimizes myelotoxicity, which is the most significant potential adverse event following PRRT. RESULTS: Sixteen key articles involving primary research were identified. A total of 2225 patients were treated (2104 treated with PRRT monotherapy and 121 with PRRT combined with chemotherapy). The average age of patients in these studies ranged from 53 to 64 years with median duration of follow-up ranging from 6 to 62 months. Short-term myelotoxicity was observed in 221 patients (10%), occurring in 213 of 2104 patients treated with PRRT monotherapy and 8 of 121 patients treated with PRRT combined with chemotherapy. Acute toxicity manifested as modest self-limited grade 3/4 toxicity (CTCAE or WHO), most often affecting platelets during the first cycle of treatment. Toxicity manifesting early was easily managed with dose modification or therapy cessation and was ameliorated by appropriate patient selection. MDS/AL was a rare stochastic event occurring in 32 (1.4%) patients. Where bone marrow biopsy was performed, cases of MDS displayed cytogenetic abnormalities, consistent with secondary MDS. Factors associated with myelotoxicity included age >70 years, impaired renal function, baseline cytopenias, prior number of therapies, prior chemotherapy (alkylating agents), and prior radiotherapy. CONCLUSION: Early therapy with PRRT-containing regimens improves outcomes, minimizes myelotoxicity, and renders the risk of MDS and AL negligible.",,"['Kesavan, Murali', 'Turner, J Harvey']","['Kesavan M', 'Turner JH']",,"['School of Medicine and Pharmacology, The University of Western Australia , Crawley, Australia .', 'School of Medicine and Pharmacology, The University of Western Australia , Crawley, Australia .']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160715,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '5H0DOZ21UJ (Lutetium)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'RWM8CCW8GP (Octreotide)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Capecitabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Dacarbazine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lutetium/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors/*radiotherapy', 'Octreotide/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Radiation Injuries/*etiology', 'Radioisotopes/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Temozolomide']",,2016/07/16 06:00,2017/02/06 06:00,['2016/07/16 06:00'],"['2016/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cbr.2016.2035 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2016 Aug;31(6):189-98. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2016.2035.

In leukemia, where leukemogenic stem cells and their progeny circulate within the peripheral blood or bone marrow, the EPR effect may not be operative. Thus, for leukemia therapeutics, it is essential to target and bind individual circulating cells. Here, we investigate mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN)-supported lipid bilayers (protocells), an emerging class of nanocarriers, and establish the synthesis conditions and lipid bilayer composition needed to achieve highly monodisperse protocells that remain stable in complex media as assessed in vitro by dynamic light scattering and cryo-electron microscopy and ex ovo by direct imaging within a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model. We show that for vesicle fusion conditions where the lipid surface area exceeds the external surface area of the MSN and the ionic strength exceeds 20 mM, we form monosized protocells (polydispersity index <0.1) on MSN cores with varying size, shape, and pore size, whose conformal zwitterionic supported lipid bilayer confers excellent stability as judged by circulation in the CAM and minimal opsonization in vivo in a mouse model. Having established protocell formulations that are stable colloids, we further modified them with anti-EGFR antibodies as targeting agents and reverified their monodispersity and stability. Then, using intravital imaging in the CAM, we directly observed in real time the progression of selective targeting of individual leukemia cells (using the established REH leukemia cell line transduced with EGFR) and delivery of a model cargo. Overall, we have established the effectiveness of the protocell platform for individual cell targeting and delivery needed for leukemia and other disseminated disease.",,"['Durfee, Paul N', 'Lin,

Because of its clinical importance, we previously mapped breakpoints of intragenic deletions and developed a multiplex PCR assay to detect recurrent intragenic DeltaIKZF1. Since the multiplex PCR was not able to detect complete deletions (IKZF1 Delta1-8), which account for ~30% of all DeltaIKZF1, we aimed at investigating the genomic scenery of IKZF1 Delta1-8. Six samples of cases with IKZF1 Delta1-8 were analyzed by microarray assay, which identified monosomy 7, isochromosome 7q, and large interstitial deletions presenting breakpoints within COBL gene. Then, we established a multiplex ligation-probe amplification (MLPA) assay and screened copy number alterations within chromosome 7 in 43 diagnostic samples with IKZF1 Delta1-8. Our results revealed that monosomy and large interstitial deletions within chromosome 7 are the main causes of IKZF1 Delta1-8. Detailed analysis using long distance inverse PCR showed that six patients (16%) had large interstitial deletions starting within intronic regions of COBL at diagnosis, which is ~611 Kb downstream of IKZF1, suggesting that COBL is a hotspot for DeltaIKZF1. We also investigated a series of 25 intragenic deletions (Delta2-8, Delta3-8 or Delta4-8) and 24 relapsed samples, and found one IKZF1-COBL tail-to-tail fusion, thus supporting that COBL is a novel hotspot for DeltaIKZF1. Finally, using RIC score methodology, we show that breakpoint sequences of IKZF1 Delta1-8 are not analog to RAG-recognition sites, suggesting a different mechanism of error promotion than that suggested for intragenic DeltaIKZF1.",,"['Lopes, Bruno Almeida', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Barbosa, Thayana Conceicao', 'Zur Stadt, Udo', 'Horstmann, Martin', 'Venn, Nicola C', 'Heatley, Susan', 'White, Deborah L', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Emerenciano, Mariana']","['Lopes BA', 'Meyer C', 'Barbosa TC', 'Zur Stadt U', 'Horstmann M', 'Venn NC', 'Heatley S', 'White DL', 'Sutton R', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'Marschalek R', 'Emerenciano M']",,"['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia/Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Center for Diagnostics, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Center for Diagnostics, University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Research Institute Children's Cancer Center, Hamburg, Germany."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Discipline of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', 'Discipline of Medicine, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.', 'Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia/Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology/ZAFES, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Biocenter, Germany.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cobl protein, human)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)', 'Chromosome 7, monosomy']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Breakpoints', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/genetics', 'DNA Copy Number Variations', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Isochromosomes/genetics', 'Male', 'Microfilament Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",PMC5288169,2016/07/16 06:00,2018/01/19 06:00,['2016/07/16 06:00'],"['2016/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10590 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10590 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):53064-53073. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10590.,['NOTNLM'],"['COBL', 'IKZF1', 'RAG', 'acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'relapse']",,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In fact, the oncogenic fusion-protein (PML-RAR) typical of this leukemia contains the retinoid-nuclear-receptor RARalpha. PML-RAR is responsible for the differentiation block of the leukemic blast. Besides PML-RAR, two endogenous RARalpha proteins are present in APL blasts, i.e. RARalpha1 and RARalpha2. We developed different cell populations characterized by PML-RAR, RARalpha2 and RARalpha1 knock-down in the APL-derived NB4 cell-line. Unexpectedly, silencing of PML-RAR and RARalpha2 results in similar increases in the constitutive expression of several granulocytic differentiation markers. This is accompanied by enhanced expression of the same granulocytic markers upon exposure of the NB4 blasts to ATRA. Silencing of PML-RAR and RARalpha2 causes also similar perturbations in the whole genome gene-expression profiles of vehicle and ATRA treated NB4 cells. Unlike PML-RAR and RARalpha2, RARalpha1 knock-down blocks ATRA-dependent induction of several granulocytic differentiation markers. Many of the effects on myeloid differentiation are confirmed by over-expression of RARalpha2 in NB4 cells. RARalpha2 action on myeloid differentiation does not require the presence of PML-RAR, as it is recapitulated also upon knock-down in PML-RAR-negative HL-60 cells. Thus, relative to RARalpha1, PML-RAR and RARalpha2 exert opposite effects on APL-cell differentiation. These contrasting actions may be related to the fact that both PML-RAR and RARalpha2 interact with and inhibit the transcriptional activity of RARalpha1. The interaction surface is located in the carboxy-terminal domain containing the D/E/F regions and it is influenced by phosphorylation of Ser-369 of RARalpha1.",,"['Gianni, Maurizio', 'Fratelli, Maddalena', 'Bolis, Marco', 'Kurosaki, Mami', 'Zanetti, Adriana', 'Paroni, Gabriela', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Borleri, Gianmaria', 'Rochette-Egly, Cecile', 'Terao, Mineko', 'Garattini, Enrico']","['Gianni M', 'Fratelli M', 'Bolis M', 'Kurosaki M', 'Zanetti A', 'Paroni G', 'Rambaldi A', 'Borleri G', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Terao M', 'Garattini E']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, 24127 Bergamo, Italy.', 'Department of Functional Genomics and Cancer, IGBMC (Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire), INSERM, U964, CNRS, UMR7104, Universite de Strasbourg, 67404 Illkirch Cedex, France.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, IRCCS-Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche ""Mario Negri"", 20156 Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",PMC5514891,2016/07/16 06:00,2018/03/20 06:00,['2016/07/16 06:00'],"['2016/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10556 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10556 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2017 Jun 6;8(23):37041-37060. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10556.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'PML-RAR', 'RARalpha2', 'retinoic acid', 'silencing']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of beta1 and beta2 integrins and CD44 in adherence of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells to bone marrow stromal cell (MSC) monolayers and the ability of MSC to prevent apoptosis of CLL cells was investigated. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells, from 8 patients with CD5-positive B-CLL, were effectively depleted of CD3-positive cells with an immunomagnetic column. Purity of B-CLL cells, as judged by coexpression of CD19 and CD5 on two-color fluor-ocytometry, was 92+/-4% (mean+/-SD) (n = 8). (51)Cr-labelled B-CLL cells, were incubated with isotype murine monoclonal antibodies or blocking MoAb's against the following adhesion proteins: integrins beta1, alpha4, and alphaL (chain of LFA-1), CD44 and CD106 (VCAM-1). The B-CLL cell adherence to marrow stromal cell (MSC) monolayers at 2hrs was 29+/-12% (mean+/-1SD). MoAb's against CD106, alpha4, and beta1 caused a significant inhibition of heterotypic adherence in 2/8, 3/8 and 4/8 experiments. Despite universal expression of alphaL on B-CLL cells, MoAb against alphaL did not influence adhesion of B-CLL cells in any of the eight experiments. MoAb's against CD44 caused an increase in B-CLL cell adherence to MSC in 1/8 experiments. No correlation between basal adhesion and intensity of alpha4 expression was noted. The absence of this correlation can be explained by the highly variable expression of alpha4 on the B-CLL cells from a limited number of patients. Notably, the intensity of alpha4 and beta1 expression, on the B-CLL cells correlated with the degree of inhibition by anti-alpha4 and anti-beta1 MoAb. A significant positive correlation was noted between baseline adhesion and intensity of beta1 expression. Thus, alpha4beta1 and its ligand VCAM-1 are important for adhesion of B-CLL cells to MSC. However, other ligands of alpha4 and other as yet undescribed adhesion proteins may also play a role in B-CLL cell adhesion to MSC.

Drug repositioning, reuse of a drug previously approved for the treatment of another condition to treat ATL, offers the possibility of reduced time and risk. Among clinically available angiotensin II receptor blockers, telmisartan is well known for its unique ability to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, which plays various roles in lipid metabolism, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis. Here, telmisartan reduced cell viability and enhanced apoptotic cells via caspase activation in ex vivo peripheral blood monocytes from asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (ACs) or via caspase-independent cell death in acute-type ATL, which has a poor prognosis. Telmisartan also induced significant growth inhibition and apoptosis in leukemia cell lines via caspase activation, whereas other angiotensin II receptor blockers did not induce cell death. Interestingly, telmisartan increased the LC3-II-enriched protein fraction, indicating autophagosome accumulation and autophagy. Thus, telmisartan simultaneously caused caspase activation and autophagy. A hypertension medication with antiproliferation effects on primary and leukemia cells is intriguing. Patients with an early diagnosis of ATL are generally monitored until the disease progresses; thus, suppression of progression from AC and indolent ATL to acute ATL is important. Our results suggest that telmisartan is highly effective against primary cells and leukemia cell lines in caspase-dependent and -independent manners, and its clinical use may suppress acute transformation and improve prognosis of patients with this mortal disease. This is the first report demonstrating a cell growth-inhibitory effect of telmisartan in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells from leukemia patients.",,"['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Soeda, Shuhei', 'Yoshimitsu, Makoto', 'Arima, Naomichi', 'Kuroki, Ayako', 'Hirata, Shinya', 'Tanaka, Hiroaki', 'Imakyure, Osamu', 'Tone, Nanako', 'Honda, Shin-Ichiro', 'Soeda, Shinji']","['Kozako T', 'Soeda S', 'Yoshimitsu M', 'Arima N', 'Kuroki A', 'Hirata S', 'Tanaka H', 'Imakyure O', 'Tone N', 'Honda S', 'Soeda S']",,"['Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology Kagoshima University Hospital Japan; Division of Hematology and Immunology School of Medical and Dental Sciences Center for Chronic Viral Diseases Graduate Kagoshima University Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology Kagoshima University Hospital Japan; Division of Hematology and Immunology School of Medical and Dental Sciences Center for Chronic Viral Diseases Graduate Kagoshima University Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Immunology School of Medical and Dental Sciences Center for Chronic Viral Diseases Graduate Kagoshima University Japan.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology Kumamoto University Hospital Japan.', 'Faculty of Sports and Health Science Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences Fukuoka University Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160413,England,FEBS Open Bio,FEBS open bio,101580716,,,,PMC4856423,2016/07/16 06:00,2016/07/16 06:01,['2016/07/16 06:00'],"['2015/10/28 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/2211-5463.12055 [doi]', 'FEB412055 [pii]']",epublish,FEBS Open Bio. 2016 Apr 13;6(5):442-60. doi: 10.1002/2211-5463.12055. eCollection 2016 May.,['NOTNLM'],"['*adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*drug repositioning', '*human T-cell leukemia virus-1', '*telmisartan']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neurofibromin1 (encoded by the NF1 gene) is a negative regulator of RAS activation. Patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 harbor loss-of-function mutations in NF1 and have a 200- to 500-fold increased risk of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Leukemia cells from patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia display hypersensitivity to certain cytokines, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. The granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor utilizes pre-associated JAK2 to initiate signals after ligand binding. JAK2 subsequently activates STAT5, among other downstream effectors. Although STAT5 is gaining recognition as an important mediator of growth factor signaling in myeloid leukemias, the contribution of STAT5 to the development of hyperactive RAS-initiated myeloproliferative disease has not been well described. In this study, we investigated the consequence of STAT5 attenuation via genetic and pharmacological approaches in Nf1-deficient murine models of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. We found that homozygous Stat5 deficiency extended the lifespan of Nf1-deficient mice and eliminated the development of myeloproliferative neoplasm associated with Nf1 gene loss. Likewise, we found that JAK inhibition with ruxolitinib attenuated myeloproliferative neoplasm in Nf1-deficient mice. Finally, we found that primary cells from a patient with KRAS-mutant juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia displayed reduced colony formation in response to JAK2 inhibition.

The programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 pathway suppresses host antitumor responses, although little is known about the significance of PD-1/PD-L1 expression in the tumor microenvironment. To investigate the clinicopathological impact of PD-L1 expression in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), we performed PD-L1 immunostaining in 135 ATLL biopsy samples. We observed 2 main groups: 1 had clear PD-L1 expression in lymphoma cells (nPD-L1(+), 7.4% of patients), and the other showed minimal expression in lymphoma cells (nPD-L1(-), 92.6%). Within the nPD-L1(-) group, 2 subsets emerged: the first displayed abundant PD-L1 expression in nonmalignant stromal cells of the tumor microenvironment (miPD-L1(+), 58.5%) and the second group did not express PD-L1 in any cell (PD-L1(-), 34.1%). nPD-L1(+) ATLL (median survival time [MST] 7.5 months, 95% CI [0.4-22.3]) had inferior overall survival (OS) compared with nPD-L1(-) ATLL (MST 14.5 months, 95% CI [10.1-20.0]) (P = .0085). Among nPD-L1(-) ATLL, miPD-L1(+) ATLL (MST 18.6 months, 95% CI [11.0-38.5]) showed superior OS compared with PD-L1(-) ATLL (MST 10.2 months, 95% CI [8.0-14.7]) (P = .0029). The expression of nPD-L1 and miPD-L1 maintained prognostic value for OS in multivariate analysis (P = .0322 and P = .0014, respectively). This is the first report describing the clinicopathological features and outcomes of PD-L1 expression in ATLL.

The fundamental decision in AML then becomes whether to recommend standard or investigational treatment. This decision must rest on the likely outcome of standard treatment. Hence we review factors that predict treatment related mortality and resistance to therapy, the latter the principal cause of failure even in patients aged 70 or above. We emphasize the limitations of prediction of resistance based only on pre- treatment factors and stress the need to incorporate post-treatment factors, for example indicators of minimal residual disease.

Therefore, therapeutic targets that modulate disrupted signaling cascades are of significant interest. In this study, we demonstrate that the tetraspanin membrane scaffold, CD82, regulates protein kinase c alpha (PKCalpha)-mediated signaling critical for AML progression. Utilizing a palmitoylation mutant form of CD82 with disrupted membrane organization, we find that the CD82 scaffold controls PKCalpha expression and activation. Combining single molecule and ensemble imaging measurements, we determine that CD82 stabilizes PKCalpha activation at the membrane and regulates the size of PKCalpha membrane clusters. Further evaluation of downstream effector signaling identified robust and sustained activation of ERK1/2 upon CD82 overexpression that results in enhanced AML colony formation. Together, these data propose a mechanism where CD82 membrane organization regulates sustained PKCalpha signaling that results in an aggressive leukemia phenotype.

Secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are one of the most devastating late effects, cause much morbidity and are the most frequent cause of late (yet still premature) treatment-related mortality. They occur in up to 7% of HSCT recipients by 20 years post-HSCT, and with no evidence yet of a plateau in incidence with longer follow-up. This review describes the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features and risk factors of the three main categories of post-HSCT SMNs. A wide range of solid SMNs has been described, usually occurring 10 years or more post-HSCT, related most often to previous or conditioning radiotherapy. Therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplasia occurs earlier, typically three to seven years post-HSCT, mainly in recipients of autologous transplant and is related to previous alkylating agent or topoisomerase II inhibitor chemotherapy.

A prospective study was conducted to quantify the medical cost burden of NIs among AL patients. METHODS: Nine hundred ninety-four patients diagnosed with AL between January 2011 and December 2013 were included. Relevant necessary information was extracted from the hospital information system and hospital infection surveillance system. The primary outcome was incidence of NIs and the secondary was economic burden results, including extra medical costs and prolonged length of stay (LOS). We estimated the total incremental cost of NIs by comparing all-cause health care costs in patients with versus without infections. Prolonged duration of stay was compared in patients with different infections. RESULTS: Of 994 patients with AL, 277 (27.9%) experienced NIs. NI was associated with a total incremental cost of $3,092 per patient ($5,227 vs $2,135; P < .01) and infected patients experienced a longer LOS (21 vs 10 days; P < .01). Patients with multisite infection had the highest total medical cost ($8,474.90 vs $2,209.90; P < .01) and the longest LOS (25 vs 15 days; P < .01). Western medicine was the main contributor to the rise of total cost in all kinds of infections. CONCLUSIONS: NI was associated with higher medical costs, which imposed an economic burden on patients with AL. The study highlights the influence of NIs on LOS and health care costs and appeal to the establishment of prophylactic measures for NIs to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources in the long run.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and', 'Epidemiology, Inc.

Tumour cells with highest adaptive potential have a selective advantage over less fit cells. Naturally occurring transmissible cancers provide an ideal model system for investigating the evolutionary arms race between cancer cells and their surrounding micro-environment and macro-environment. However, the evolutionary landscapes in which contagious cancers reside have not been subjected to comprehensive investigation. Here, we provide a multifocal analysis of transmissible tumour progression and discuss the selection forces that shape it. We demonstrate that transmissible cancers adapt to both their micro-environment and macro-environment, and evolutionary theories applied to organisms are also relevant to these unique diseases. The three naturally occurring transmissible cancers, canine transmissible venereal tumour (CTVT) and Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease (DFTD) and the recently discovered clam leukaemia, exhibit different evolutionary phases: (i) CTVT, the oldest naturally occurring cell line is remarkably stable; (ii) DFTD exhibits the signs of stepwise cancer evolution; and (iii) clam leukaemia shows genetic instability. While all three contagious cancers carry the signature of ongoing and fairly recent adaptations to selective forces, CTVT appears to have reached an evolutionary stalemate with its host, while DFTD and the clam leukaemia appear to be still at a more dynamic phase of their evolution. Parallel investigation of contagious cancer genomes and transcriptomes and of their micro-environment and macro-environment could shed light on the selective forces shaping tumour development at different time points: during the progressive phase and at the endpoint. A greater understanding of transmissible cancers from an evolutionary ecology perspective will provide novel avenues for the prevention and treatment of both contagious and non-communicable cancers.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Refinements in treatment protocols and improvements in supportive care for this most common pediatric malignancy have led to a cure rate that now approaches 90%. However, certain pediatric ALL subgroups remain relatively intractable to treatment and many patients who relapse face a similarly dismal outcome. Moreover, survivors of pediatric ALL suffer the long-term sequelae of their intensive treatment throughout their lives. Therefore, the development of drugs to treat relapsed/refractory pediatric ALL, as well as those that more specifically target leukemia cells, remains a high priority. As pediatric malignancies represent a minority of the overall cancer burden, it is not surprising that they are generally underrepresented in drug development efforts. The identification of novel therapies relies largely on the reappropriation of drugs developed for adult malignancies. However, despite the large number of experimental agents available, clinical evaluation of novel drugs for pediatric ALL is hindered by limited patient numbers and the availability of effective established drugs. The Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) was established in 2005 to provide a mechanism by which novel therapeutics could be evaluated against xenograft and cell line models of the most common childhood malignancies, including ALL, to prioritize those with the greatest activity for clinical evaluation. In this article, we review the results of >50 novel agents and combinations tested against the PPTP ALL xenografts, highlighting comparisons between PPTP results and clinical data where possible.",,"['Jones, L', 'Carol, H', 'Evans, K', 'Richmond, J', 'Houghton, P J', 'Smith, M A', 'Lock, R B']","['Jones L', 'Carol H', 'Evans K', 'Richmond J', 'Houghton PJ', 'Smith MA', 'Lock RB']",,"[""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia."", ""Molecular Medicine, Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI, Bethesda, MD, USA.', ""Leukaemia Biology Program, Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160715,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Salvage Therapy/trends', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,2016/11/03 06:00,2017/08/15 06:00,['2016/07/16 06:00'],"['2016/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016192 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.192 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Nov;30(11):2133-2141. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.192.

In patients with AL amyloidosis, LC aggregates progressively accumulate in organs, resulting in organ failure that is particularly lethal when the heart is involved. A significant obstacle in the development of treatments for patients with AL amyloidosis, as well as for those with any disease that is rare, severe and heterogeneous, has been satisfying traditional clinical trial end points (for example, overall survival or progression-free survival). It is for this reason that many organizations, including the United States Food and Drug Administration through its Safety and Innovation Act Accelerated Approval pathway, have recognized the need for biomarkers as surrogate end points. The international AL amyloidosis expert community is in agreement that the N-terminal fragment of the pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is analytically validated and clinically qualified as a biomarker for use as a surrogate end point for survival in patients with AL amyloidosis. Underlying this consensus is the demonstration that NT-proBNP is an indicator of cardiac response in all interventional studies in which it has been assessed, despite differences in patient population, treatment type and treatment schedule. Furthermore, NT-proBNP expression is directly modulated by amyloidogenic LC-elicited signal transduction pathways in cardiomyocytes. The use of NT-proBNP will greatly facilitate the development of targeted therapies for AL amyloidosis.

Organomegaly was measured by magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetry of the liver and spleen. In multivariate analysis of all patients, an increased spleen volume 450 ml (hazard ratio (HR), 5.2; 95% confidence interval (CI), (2.1-13.0); P=0.003) and an elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP; HR 5.0 (1.1-22.2); P=0.02) were associated with adverse OS. The 3-year OS was 100, 77, and 39%, respectively (P<0.0001), for patients with 0 (low risk, n=37), 1 (intermediate risk, n=32) or 2 (high risk, n=39) parameters. For advSM patients with fully available clinical and molecular data (n=60), univariate analysis identified splenomegaly 1200 ml, elevated AP and mutations in the SRSF2/ASXL1/RUNX1 (S/A/R) gene panel as significant prognostic markers. In multivariate analysis, mutations in S/A/R (HR 3.2 (1.1-9.6); P=0.01) and elevated AP (HR 2.6 (1.0-7.1); P=0.03) remained predictive adverse prognostic markers for OS.

We evaluated the prognostic value and biological impact of minimal residual disease (MRD) and of the allelic ratio (AR) of FLT3-internal-tandem duplication (ITD) in childhood AML. We retrospectively screened 494 children with de novo AML for FLT3-ITD mutation, identifying 54 harboring the mutation; 51% of them presented high ITD-AR at diagnosis and had worse event-free survival (EFS, 19.2 versus 63.5% for low ITD-AR, <0.05). Forty-one percent of children with high levels of MRD after the 1st induction course, measured by a patient-specific real-time-PCR, had worse EFS (22.2 versus 59.4% in low-MRD patients, P<0.05). Next, we correlated these parameters with gene expression, showing that patients with high ITD-AR or persistent MRD had characteristic expression profiles with deregulated genes involved in methylation and acetylation. Moreover, patients with high CyclinA1 expression presented an unfavorable EFS (20.3 versus 51.2% in low CyclinA1 group, P<0.01). Our results suggest that ITD-AR levels and molecular MRD should be considered in planning clinical management of FLT3-ITD patients.

We studied 521 patients with CN-AML in CR1, for whom mutational status of NPM1 and FLT3-ITD was available, including the FLT3-ITD allelic ratio. PRT consisted of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) (n=68), myeloablative conditioning (MAC) alloHSCT (n=137), autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (autoHSCT) (n=168) or chemotherapy (n=148).

First-line imatinib treatment, with selective switching to nilotinib when patients fail to meet specific molecular targets or for imatinib intolerance, results in excellent overall molecular responses and survival. However, this strategy is less effective in cases of primary imatinib resistance; moreover, 25% of patients develop secondary resistance such that 20-35% of patients initially treated with imatinib will eventually experience treatment failure. Early identification of these patients is of high clinical relevance. Since the drug efflux transporter ABCB1 has previously been implicated in TKI resistance, we determined if early increases in ABCB1 mRNA expression (fold change from diagnosis to day 22 of imatinib therapy) predict for patient response. Indeed, patients exhibiting a high fold rise (2.2, n=79) were significantly less likely to achieve early molecular response (BCR-ABL1(IS) 10% at 3 months; P=0.001), major molecular response (P<0.0001) and MR4.5 (P<0.0001). Additionally, patients demonstrated increased levels of ABCB1 mRNA before the development of mutations and/or progression to blast crisis. Patients with high fold rise in ABCB1 mRNA were also less likely to achieve major molecular response when switched to nilotinib therapy (49% vs 82% of patients with low fold rise).

We searched for specific genes whose expression level was associated with response status. Using microarrays, we analyzed gene expression patterns in bone marrow CD34(+) cells in serial samples from 32 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia-related changes before and during the AZA therapy. At baseline, a comparison of the responders and non-responders showed 52 differentially expressed genes (P < 0.01). Functional annotation of the deregulated genes revealed categories primarily related to ribosomes and pathways associated with proliferation. The expression level of RPL28 correlated with overall survival. We identified altered expression in 167 genes in responders, 26 genes in non-responders with stable disease, and 13 genes in non-responders with disease progression using paired t test of expression levels in patients before and during treatment.

GILZ regulates numerous signal transduction pathways involved in proliferation and survival of normal and neoplastic cells. Here, we have demonstrated the potential of GILZ in alleviating apoptosis induced by ER stress inducers. Whereas the glucocorticoid, dexamethasone, protects from tunicamycin-induced cell death, silencing endogeneous GILZ in dexamethasone-treated cancer cells alter the capacity of glucocorticoids to protect from tunicamycin-mediated apoptosis. Under ER stress conditions, overexpression of GILZ significantly reduced activation of mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis by maintaining Bcl-xl level. GILZ protein affects the UPR signaling shifting the balance towards pro-survival signals as judged by down-regulation of CHOP, ATF4, XBP1s mRNA and increase in GRP78 protein level. Interestingly, GILZ sustains high mitochondrial OXPHOS during ER stress and cytoprotection mediated by GILZ is abolished in cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA, which are OXPHOS-deficient. These findings reveal a new role of GILZ, which acts as a cytoprotector against ER stress through a pathway involving mitochondrial OXPHOS.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although FC plays a key role as a posttherapy prognosticator and evaluator of therapeutic efficacy, the manual analysis of cytometry data is a barrier to optimization of reproducibility and objectivity. This study investigates the utility of our recently introduced nonparametric Bayesian framework in accurately predicting the direction of change in disease progression in AML patients using FC data. METHODS: The highly flexible nonparametric Bayesian model based on the infinite mixture of infinite Gaussian mixtures is used for jointly modeling data from multiple FC samples to automatically identify functionally distinct cell populations and their local realizations. Phenotype vectors are obtained by characterizing each sample by the proportions of recovered cell populations, which are, in turn, used to predict the direction of change in disease progression for each patient. RESULTS: We used 200 diseased and nondiseased immunophenotypic panels for training and tested the system with 36 additional AML cases collected at multiple time points. The proposed framework identified the change in direction of disease progression with accuracies of 90% (nine out of ten) for relapsing cases and 100% (26 out of 26) for the remaining cases. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that these promising results are an important first step toward the development of automated predictive systems for disease monitoring and continuous response evaluation.

However, it is unknown if the widespread use of hypomethylating agents has changed the risk of immunisation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of azacitidine (AZA) therapy on red blood cell (RBC) alloimmunisation in transfused patients with MDS, myelodysplastic syndromes/myeloproliferative syndromes (MDS/MPS) and secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have analysed retrospectively all patients with MDS, MDS/MPS and secondary AML from MDS, who received their first transfusion in our hospital between January 1995 and December 2014. We have assessed the impact of age, sex, RBC and platelets units transfused, and AZA treatment on developing alloantibodies. RESULTS: In our study, the number of RBC units transfused increased the risk of developing alloantibodies. However aging and the treatment with AZA were associated with a lower rate of alloimmunisation. DISCUSSION: Patients with MDS, MDS/MPS and secondary AML who received treatment with AZA developed RBC antibodies at a lower rate than control group.

We used logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Seventy-nine cases (25%) and 339 controls (20%) had performed night work. Overall, working in night shifts was not associated with CLL (OR = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.78-1.45, compared with day work). However, long-term night shift (>20 years) was positively associated with CLL (OR(tertile 3 vs . day-work) = 1.77; 95% = 1.14-2.74), although no linear trend was observed (P trend = 0.18). This association was observed among those with rotating (OR(tertile 3 vs . day-work) = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.33-3.92; P trend = 0.07), but not permanent night shifts (OR(tertile 3 vs . day-work) = 1.16; 95% CI = 0.60-2.25; P trend = 0.86). The association between CLL and long-term rotating night shift warrants further investigation.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Costas, Laura', 'Benavente, Yolanda', 'Olmedo-Requena, Rocio', 'Casabonne,

This study was undertaken to evaluate the relationships between clinical factors, type of MDS, DNA ploidy, and Ki-67 expression. DESIGN: Air-dried bone marrow smears from 27 patients were Feulgen stained for DNA and analyzed using the CAS 200 image analyzer. Ki-67 expression was also examined by image analysis in 25 of these cases in bone marrow core biopsy specimens using the monoclonal antibody MIB-1. Age, sex, bone marrow cellularity, and MDS grade of each patient were also recorded. Percent S-phase was assessed only for the diploid samples. RESULTS: There were 16 diploid and 11 aneuploid cases on analysis of Feulgen-stained bone marrow aspirate smears. The percentage of MIB-1+ cells ranged from 6.4%-61.7% (mean-37.7 +/- 6.4%). Among the 16 diploid cases, 18.2 +/- 5.7% of the cells were in S-phase. High grade MDS (RAEB-T, RAEB, CMML) was associated with younger age and male sex (p = 0.03), lower percentage of cells in S-phase (p = 0.04), greater bone marrow cellularity (p = 0.005), and greater MIB-1 expression (p = 0.04). With increasing age, there were more females (p = 0.03), more low grade MDS (RA, RARS), and a lower percentage of cells in S-Phase (p = 0.04). Female patients tended to be older, have less cellular bone marrows (p = 0.003), less MIB-1 expression (p = 0.03), low grade MDS (p = 0.02), and increased percentage of cells in S phase (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: Ki-67 expression, percent cells in S-phase, clinical parameters and subtype of MDS tend to distinguish two separate groups of MDS patients, and may explain in part the difference in biologic behaviour between high and low grade MDS.",,"['Ben-Ezra, J M', 'Trinh, K', 'Harris, A C', 'Kornstein, M J']","['Ben-Ezra JM', 'Trinh K', 'Harris AC', 'Kornstein MJ']",,"['a Department of Pathology , Medical College of Virginia Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Pathology , Medical College of Virginia Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Pathology , Medical College of Virginia Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.', 'a Department of Pathology , Medical College of Virginia Campus of Virginia Commonwealth University , Richmond , VA , USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1998/01/01 00:00,1998/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '1998/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1998.11746393 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1998;3(3):215-22. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1998.11746393.,['NOTNLM'],"['Ki-67', 'Myelodysplasia', 'S-phase', 'ploidy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most frequent cause of treatment failure is leukaemic relapse, due to the re-emergence of malignant recipient clones. Clinical and haematological relapse is usually preceded by molecular evidence of relapse. Early detection of molecular relapse may allow intervention with immunotherapy such as donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). This study was undertaken to compare results from two centres who employ either Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of DNA polymorphisms as their routine method of detecting residual host cells following BMT for CML in order to establish (1) if these methods are equivalent for routine laboratory use in reporting of chimaerism results to the referring clinician, and (2) if these methods are beneficial for indicating new and early therapeutic strategies. FISH analyses for the X and Y chromosomes (in sex mismatched patients) and/or FISH for BCR and ABL loci were compared with short tandem repeat PCR (STR-PCR) and conventional karyotyping in serial analyses in 25 patients submitted to BMT for Philadelphia positive (Ph) CML. Comparison of all results on samples assessed between 1 and 13 years post BMT indicated that FISH and PCR, performed on the same bone marrow samples displayed similar results in more than 90% of patients in first 3 years after BMT which increased to a concordance rate of 100% in long term survivors. In contrast, comparison of FISH or PCR versus cytogenetic analysis indicated a low concordance rate, with less than 50% of samples showing similar results during all the follow-up period. Eighty percent of recipients (22 patients) had evidence of mixed chimaerism following BMT (initial level of positivity 1-6% recipient cells) during the follow-up period. This low percentage of recipient cells remained stable in 7 patients, while 9 patients reverted to a donor profile. All 16 patients are in haematological remission. In addition the 3 patients with complete donor chimaerism remain in remission. In the remaining 6 patients, a progressive increase in recipient cells occurred (progressive mixed chimaerism, PMC), and was followed by haematological relapse. We conclude that FISH and PCR can be used to monitor CML patients post BMT and transient or stable low level mixed chimaerism is not associated with leukaemia relapse, but PMC is predictive of imminent relapse and its detection may help to illucidate the timing of early intervention with donor lymphocyte infusion.",,"['Palka, G', 'Lawler, M', 'Morizio, E', 'Gardiner, N', 'Stuppia, L', 'De Arce, M A', 'Di Bartolomeo, P D', 'Capodiferro, F', 'Sabatino, G', 'Gatta, V', 'Calabrese, G', 'Cann, S R']","['Palka G', 'Lawler M', 'Morizio E', 'Gardiner N', 'Stuppia L', 'De Arce MA', 'Di Bartolomeo PD', 'Capodiferro F', 'Sabatino G', 'Gatta V', 'Calabrese G', 'Cann SR']",,"['a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'b Dept Haematology, Sir Patrick Dun Research Laboratory , St. James Hospital Dublin , Ireland.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'b Dept Haematology, Sir Patrick Dun Research Laboratory , St. James Hospital Dublin , Ireland.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'd Istituto di Citomorfologia Umana Normale e Patologica CNR , Chieti , Italy.', 'b Dept Haematology, Sir Patrick Dun Research Laboratory , St. James Hospital Dublin , Ireland.', 'c Dept Haematology , Pescara Hospital , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'a Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche , University of Chieti , Italy.', 'b Dept Haematology, Sir Patrick Dun Research Laboratory , St. James Hospital Dublin , Ireland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1998/01/01 00:00,1998/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/15 06:00'],"['2016/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '1998/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1998/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1998.11746391 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1998;3(3):193-203. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1998.11746391.,['NOTNLM'],"['Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH)', 'Haemopoietic chimaerism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)', 'allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT)', 'chronic myeloid leukaemia', 'residual host cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Automated identification of regenerating bone marrow cell populations using support vector machines.,978-986,10.1002/cyto.a.22905 [doi],"Identification and quantification of maturing hematopoietic cell populations in flow cytometry data sets is a complex and sometimes irreproducible step in data analysis. Supervised machine learning algorithms present promise to automatically classify cells into populations, reducing subjective bias in data analysis. We describe the use of support vector machines (SVMs), a supervised algorithm, to reproducibly identify two distinctly different populations of normal hematopoietic cells, mature lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells, in the challenging setting of pediatric bone marrow specimens obtained 1 month after chemotherapy. Four-color flow cytometry data were collected on a FACS Calibur for 77 randomly selected postchemotherapy pediatric patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group clinical trial AAML1031. These patients demonstrated no evidence of detectable residual disease and were divided into training (n = 27) and testing (n = 50) cohorts. SVMs were trained to identify mature lymphocytes and uncommitted progenitor cells in the training cohort before independent evaluation of prediction efficiency in the testing cohort. Both SVMs demonstrated high predictive performance (lymphocyte SVM: sensitivity >0.99, specificity >0.99; uncommitted progenitor cell SVM: sensitivity = 0.94, specificity >0.99) and closely mirrored manual cell classifications by two expert-analysts. SVMs present an efficient, automated methodology for identifying normal cell populations even in stressed bone marrows, replicating the performance of an expert while reducing the intrinsic bias of gating procedures between multiple analysts.

The eventual aim to devise novel therapeutic strategies to treat human diseases, in particular solid tumours and monogenic disorders associated with various enzyme deficiency states. The easy accessibility and the ability of haemopoetic stem cells to self replicate and repopulate makes them desirable targets for gene transfer. In theory the introduction of a small number of gene modifed haemopoetic progenitor cells can allow therapy of an individual for life without any further intervention. This approach has been used for the treatment of single gene defects such as ADA deficiency.

Drug sensitivity tests employing leukemic colony assay revealed the effects of cytotoxic drugs on LSC to be diverse and that cytosine arabinoside predominantly suppresses self-renewal, which probably accounts for its effectiveness in AML therapy. Hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) regulate the growth of LSC and various in vitro effects of HGFs on acute leukemia cells have been reported. These effects appear to reflect physiological functions of each HGF and can be categorized into groups according to their distinct functions. Endogenously produced HGFs stimulate LSC in an autocrine or a paracrine fashion, resulting in autonomous growth of these cells, which also correlates with the patients' prognosis. HGFs can enhance the cytotoxicity of anti-leukemia drugs in vitro, possibly mainly through recruitment of LSC from the dormant state into active cell cycling. HGFs have been clinically tested in leukemia therapy. Although recovery of blood leukocyte counts can consistently be accelerated with HGF treatment, the effectiveness of HGFs in sensitizing leukemia cells to chemotherapeutic agents and/or improving patient prognosis has not been clearly demonstrated.

In this study we investigated the effect of shikonin on the survival of acute myeloid leukemia cells and the role of ER-stress protein ERP57, a protein disulfide isomerase, in improvement of chemotherapy. METHODS: Using MTT assay we studied cytotoxic effects of shikonin on HL-60 cells. The flow cytometry was adopted to examine the shikonin induced mode of cell death in HL-60 cells. The overall protein expression alteration resulting from shikonin treatment was investigated using proteomics methods. Western blotting was performed to quantify the alteration in protein expression in HL-60 after shikonin treatment. Silencing and overexpression studies were carried out to highlight the therapeutic role of ERP57 in shikonin effect on AML cells. RESULTS: Shikonin induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells without significant effect on Primary cells from healthy volunteers. The apoptotic effect was dose and time dependent and was accompanied by strong alteration in cell proteome. Among the proteins targeted by shikonin, ERP57 was significantly downregulated in HL-60 after treatment. Compared to healthy control ERP57 was found to be highly expressed in AML cell line HL60 and was downregulated after shikonin treatment. Overexpression of ERP57 protected HL-60 from shikonin induced apoptosis, whereas knockdown of ERP57 expression resulted in increase in shikonin induced apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that ERP57 plays a crucial role in resistance towards shikonin induced apoptosis in AML cells. Targeting of ERP57 might offer a new therapeutic option for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['(c) 2016 The Author(s) Published by S.

In a small retrospective analysis, we found that 6-MP could induce marked haematological improvement in a considerable number of AML patients who were not treated with intensive remission induction courses. Due to the inherent limitations of retrospective analyses, we then investigated prospectively in 51 consecutive patients over a 3-year period in a single centre, to what extent, oral 6-MP 250 mg twice a week could be beneficial to AML patients who were not-or no longer-eligible for intensive chemotherapy. Clinical response was scored according to changes in blood cell counts and dependency on blood transfusions. Thirteen patients (25%) were considered responders since they showed an increased platelet count from the first month after initiation of 6-MP onwards and they became independent of blood transfusions after 3 months. This effect lasted for 13 (range 7-30+) months. Median overall survival of this subgroup was 16.5 (6-33+) months. Ten patients (20%) had a shorter or incomplete response and a survival of 12 (6-30) months. Seven patients were lost to follow-up. Twenty-one (41%) failed to respond and survived for 4 (1.5-17) months. The response seemed not to be affected by previous chemotherapy, history of myelodysplasia, or karyotype abnormalities, but high leukocyte count initially was unfavourable. 6-MP thus can induce marked improvement of blood cell counts in a considerable proportion of AML patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy, leading to good quality of life and a significant prolongation of survival.",,"['Daenen, S M', 'De Wolf, J T', 'Vellenga, E', 'Van Imhoff, G W', 'Smit, J W', 'Berg-De Rutter, E V']","['Daenen SM', 'De Wolf JT', 'Vellenga E', 'Van Imhoff GW', 'Smit JW', 'Berg-De Rutter EV']",,"['a Department of Haematolog , University Hospital , Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Haematolog , University Hospital , Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Haematolog , University Hospital , Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'a Department of Haematolog , University Hospital , Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'b Central Laboratory , University Hospital , Hanzeplein 1, 9713 GZ Groningen , The Netherlands.', 'c Department of Medical Genetics , A.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) plays a survival role in HL-60 cells by protecting them from the induction of apoptosis via oxidative stress. Flow cytometry and Hoechst staining revealed that PGE2 suppresses menadione-induced apoptosis, cell shrinkage, and chromatin condensation, by blocking the generation of reactive oxygen species. Treatment of DA was found to reverse the survival effect of PGE2 as well as restoring the menadione-mediated cleavage of caspase-3, lamin B, and PARP. DA blocked PGE2-induced activation of the EP2 receptor signaling pathway, including the activation of PKA and the phosphorylation of CREB. DA also inhibited PGE2-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 and the activation of the Ras/Raf/ Erk pathway, which activates downstream targets for cell survival. Finally, DA greatly reduced the PGE2-induced activation of NF-kappaB p50 and p65 subunits.

They imply a causal relationship, but the mechanism of this transformation remains to be established. These terms may ultimately be too restrictive, since the leukemia that develops after exposure to benzene or atomic bomb irradiation is very similar or identical to the therapy-related leukemia syndrome.

With the identification of the Philadelphia chromosome and its association with 95% of cases of CML and later with the possible etiologic role of the BCR-ABL fusion gene in the initiation of CML, a new chapter in the understanding of leukemogenesis was entered upon. Later with the identification of interferons as a therapeutic modality, and demonstration of their role in suppression of the malignant clone and the associated increase in survival, CML was one of the first malignancies in which biologic therapy found an established role. With advances in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, it is hoped that more patients would be able to benefit from this curative therapy with less associated toxicity. However, a large proportion of patients are still unable to undergo an allogeneic transplant due to lack of donors and the expected toxicity. Other therapeutic modalities including new forms of interferon, new agents such as Homoharringtonine, and new techniques such as purged autologous transplant with or without immuno-modulation need to be further developed and perfected.

Current first-line treatments include chemotherapy and steroids that are effective but often associated with adverse effects, whereas the disease may reactivate despite an initial response to first-line agents. Bisphosphonates are osteoclast inhibitors that have shown to be helpful in treating bone lesions of LCH. To date, there are no large international studies to describe their role in treating bone lesions of LCH. METHOD: We conducted a multicenter retrospective review of 13 patients with histologically proven LCH, who had received bisphosphonates either at diagnosis or at disease reactivation. RESULTS: Ten patients (77%) had a single system bone disease, and 3 (23%) had bone lesions as part of multisystem disease. Median follow-up time post-bisphosphonate therapy was 4.6 years (range, 0.8 to 8.2 years). Treatment with bisphosphonates was associated with significant pain relief in almost all patients. Twelve (92%) achieved resolution of active bone lesions, and 10 out of them had no active disease for a median of 3.5 years (range, 0.8 to 5 years). One patient did not respond. No major adverse effects were reported in this series. CONCLUSION: Bisphosphonates are well-tolerated drugs that can significantly improve bone pain and induce remission in active bone LCH. Future prospective studies evaluating the role of bisphosphonates in LCH are warranted.",,"['Chellapandian, Deepak', 'Makras, Polyzois', 'Kaltsas, Gregory', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Naccache, Lamia', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Carret, Anne-Sophie', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Egeler, R Maarten', 'Abla, Oussama']","['Chellapandian D', 'Makras P', 'Kaltsas G', 'van den Bos C', 'Naccache L', 'Rampal R', 'Carret AS', 'Weitzman S', 'Egeler RM', 'Abla O']",,"['Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Endocrinology & Diabetes, 251 Hellenic Airforce & VA General Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Hemato-oncologue pediatrique, Centre hospitalier universitaire de Quebec, Quebec City, Canada.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Sainte-Justine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Department of Pediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],['K08 CA188529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20160701,Italy,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis,Mediterranean journal of hematology and infectious diseases,101530512,,,,PMC4928520,2016/07/15 06:00,2016/07/15 06:01,['2016/07/15 06:00'],"['2016/06/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/15 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4084/MJHID.2016.033 [doi]', 'mjhid-8-1-e2016033 [pii]']",epublish,Mediterr J Hematol Infect Dis. 2016 Jul 1;8(1):e2016033. doi: 10.4084/MJHID.2016.033. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bone marrow blasts, monocytes, and granulocytes from CMML subgroups (n = 30; World Health Organization types 1/2, proliferative/dysplastic, therapy related/de novo, and low/intermediate/high cytogenetic risk) were immunophenotypically compared by flow cytometry with 10 nonneoplastic control marrows. RESULTS: Aberrancies were present in blasts of 26 (87%) of 30 CMMLs (26 diagnostic; four follow-up) and six (60%) of 10 controls (P = .089), monocytes of 28 (93%) of 30 CMMLs and six (60%) of 10 controls (P = .026), and granulocytes of eight (28%) of 29 CMMLs and zero of 10 controls (P = .166). Underexpression of CD14 and CD15 on monocytes was more common in CMMLs compared with controls (P = .008 and P = .043). Statistical analysis showed no significant difference in antigen expression between the CMML subgroups on blasts or monocytes; granulocytes demonstrated more common HLA-DR expression in CMML-2 vs CMML-1.

Transplantation of mutant mouse bone marrow into wild-type recipients was sufficient to recapitulate the phenotypes observed in the mutant animals, including autoimmunity and premature mortality.

In this study, we have shown that indirubin-3-oxime, a derivative of indirubin originally designed for leukemia therapy, could prevent hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced apoptosis in both SH-SY5Y cells and primary cerebellar granule neurons. H2O2 exposure led to the increased activities of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in SH-SY5Y cells. Indirubin-3-oxime treatment significantly reversed the altered activity of both the PI3-K/Akt/GSK3beta cascade and the ERK pathway induced by H2O2. In addition, both GSK3beta and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors significantly prevented H2O2-induced neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, specific inhibitors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) abolished the neuroprotective effects of indirubin-3-oxime against H2O2-induced neuronal apoptosis. These results strongly suggest that indirubin-3-oxime prevents H2O2-induced apoptosis via concurrent inhibiting GSK3beta and the ERK pathway in SH-SY5Y cells, providing support for the use of indirubin-3-oxime to treat neurodegenerative disorders caused or exacerbated by oxidative stress.",,"['Yu, Jie', 'Zheng, Jiacheng', 'Lin, Jiajia', 'Jin, Linlu', 'Yu, Rui', 'Mak, Shinghung', 'Hu, Shengquan', 'Sun, Hongya', 'Wu, Xiang', 'Zhang, Zaijun', 'Lee, Mingyuen', 'Tsim, Wahkeung', 'Su, Wei', 'Zhou, Wenhua', 'Cui, Wei', 'Han, Yifan', 'Wang, Qinwen']","['Yu J', 'Zheng J', 'Lin J', 'Jin L', 'Yu R', 'Mak S', 'Hu S', 'Sun H', 'Wu X', 'Zhang Z', 'Lee M', 'Tsim W', 'Su W', 'Zhou W', 'Cui W', 'Han Y', 'Wang Q']",,"['Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Ningbo Xiaoshi High School, Ningbo, 315010, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Department of Applied Biology and Chemistry Technology, Institute of Modern Chinese Medicine, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'Department of Applied Biology and Chemistry Technology, Institute of Modern Chinese Medicine, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China.', 'The Affiliated Yinzhou Hospital, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Institute of New Drug Research, Guangdong Province Key Laboratory of Pharmacodynamic, Constituents of Traditional Chinese Medicine and New Drug Research, College of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangdong, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Institute of Chinese Medical Sciences, University of Macau, Macau, China.', 'Division of Life Science and Center for Chinese Medicine, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China.', 'Ningbo Xiaoshi High School, Ningbo, 315010, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China. cuiwei@nbu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Applied Biology and Chemistry Technology, Institute of Modern Chinese Medicine, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China. bcyfhan@polyu.edu.hk.', 'Ningbo Key Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, Zhejiang Provincial Key Laboratory of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Ningbo University, Ningbo, 315211, China. wangqinwen@nbu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160713,United States,Cell Mol Neurobiol,Cellular and molecular neurobiology,8200709,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",,2016/07/15 06:00,2017/04/18 06:00,['2016/07/15 06:00'],"['2016/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10571-016-0402-z [doi]', '10.1007/s10571-016-0402-z [pii]']",ppublish,Cell Mol Neurobiol. 2017 May;37(4):655-664. doi: 10.1007/s10571-016-0402-z.

This study investigated the association between cigarette smoking and the risk of ATLL development among Japanese carriers of HTLV-1. METHODS: This study examined the association between smoking and development of ATLL in a cohort of 1,332 Japanese HTLV-1 carriers aged 40-69 years free of ATLL at baseline from two different HTLV-1-endemic areas of Japan. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sex, geographic area, age at baseline, and alcohol drinking were used to estimate the effect of cigarette smoking on ATLL development. RESULTS: Between 1993 and 2012, 25 new ATLL cases were identified among these subjects. The overall crude incidence rate for ATLL was 1.08 per 1,000 person-years among HTLV-1 carriers and was higher among male carriers than among female carriers (2.21 vs. 0.74). The risk of ATLL development increased significantly with increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked per day (hazard ratio for every increment of 20 cigarettes, 2.03; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.13-3.66 overall, 2.07 (95 % CI 1.13-3.73) in male carriers).

Deep molecular responses are associated with improved long-term outcomes and are required prior to attempting cessation of treatment in treatment-free remission clinical trials. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European LeukemiaNet recommend regular monitoring of BCR-ABL1 RNA levels using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR). However, BCR-ABL1 RQ-PCR is a complex laboratory-developed test; routine quantitative results from clinical diagnostic laboratories may differ from those used to establish the recommendations.

As well as BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms, disease persistence has been shown to play a key role. Disease persistence suggests that, despite a targeted therapeutic approach, BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms are being exploited to sustain the survival of a small population of cells termed leukaemic stem cells (LSCs). Increasing evidence highlights the importance of self-renewal and survival pathways in this process. This review will focus on the role of stem-cell restricted self-renewal pathways, namely Hedgehog, Notch, and Bone Morphogenic Pathway (BMP). Wingless-Int/beta-Catenin (Wnt/beta-Catenin) signalling will be discussed within a further review in this series in view of its regulatory role in GSK3beta.

At the top of the haemato-vascular specification cascade lies cloche, a gene that when mutated in zebrafish leads to the striking phenotype of loss of most endothelial and haematopoietic cells and a significant increase in cardiomyocyte numbers. Although this mutant has been analysed extensively to investigate mesoderm diversification and differentiation and continues to be broadly used as a unique avascular model, the isolation of the cloche gene has been challenging due to its telomeric location. Here we used a deletion allele of cloche to identify several new cloche candidate genes within this genomic region, and systematically genome-edited each candidate. Through this comprehensive interrogation, we succeeded in isolating the cloche gene and discovered that it encodes a PAS-domain-containing bHLH transcription factor, and that it is expressed in a highly specific spatiotemporal pattern starting during late gastrulation. Gain-of-function experiments show that it can potently induce endothelial gene expression. Epistasis experiments reveal that it functions upstream of etv2 and tal1, the earliest expressed endothelial and haematopoietic transcription factor genes identified to date. A mammalian cloche orthologue can also rescue blood vessel formation in zebrafish cloche mutants, indicating a highly conserved role in vertebrate vasculogenesis and haematopoiesis. The identification of this master regulator of endothelial and haematopoietic fate enhances our understanding of early mesoderm diversification and may lead to improved protocols for the generation of endothelial and haematopoietic cells in vivo and in vitro.",,"['Reischauer, Sven', 'Stone, Oliver A', 'Villasenor, Alethia', 'Chi, Neil', 'Jin, Suk-Won', 'Martin, Marcel', 'Lee, Miler T', 'Fukuda,

Genetic loss of Ripk3 converted murine FLT3-ITD-driven myeloproliferation into an overt AML by enhancing the accumulation of leukemia-initiating cells (LIC). Failed inflammasome activation and cell death mediated by tumor necrosis factor receptor caused this accumulation of LIC exemplified by accelerated leukemia onset in Il1r1(-/-), Pycard(-/-), and Tnfr1/2(-/-) mice. RIPK3 signaling was partly mediated by mixed lineage kinase domain-like. This link between suppression of RIPK3, failed interleukin-1beta release, and blocked cell death was supported by significantly reduced RIPK3 in primary AML patient cohorts.

Currently, there is very limited understanding of the potential underlying mechanisms that result in the range of phenotypes which constitute JIA.The elucidation of the functional relevance of genetic associations with phenotypic traits is a fundamental problem that hampers the translation of genetic observations to plausible medical interventions. Genome wide association studies, and subsequent fine-mapping studies in JIA patients, have identified many genetic variants associated with disease. Such approaches rely on 'tag' single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The associated SNPs are rarely functional variants, so the extrapolation of genetic association data to the identification of biologically meaningful findings can be a protracted undertaking. Integrative genomics aims to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype.Systems biology, principally through network analysis, is emerging as a valuable way to identify biological pathways of relevance to complex genetic diseases.

We hypothesized that immune checkpoint blockade established by targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 with ipilimumab could restore antitumor reactivity through a graft-versus-tumor effect. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1/1b multicenter, investigator-initiated study to determine the safety and efficacy of ipilimumab in patients with relapsed hematologic cancer after allogeneic HSCT. Patients received induction therapy with ipilimumab at a dose of 3 or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses, with additional doses every 12 weeks for up to 60 weeks in patients who had a clinical benefit. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were enrolled. Immune-related adverse events, including one death, were observed in 6 patients (21%), and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that precluded further administration of ipilimumab was observed in 4 patients (14%). No responses that met formal response criteria occurred in patients who received a dose of 3 mg per kilogram. Among 22 patients who received a dose of 10 mg per kilogram, 5 (23%) had a complete response, 2 (9%) had a partial response, and 6 (27%) had decreased tumor burden. Complete responses occurred in 4 patients with extramedullary acute myeloid leukemia and 1 patient with the myelodysplastic syndrome developing into acute myeloid leukemia. Four patients had a durable response for more than 1 year. Responses were associated with in situ infiltration of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, decreased activation of regulatory T cells, and expansion of subpopulations of effector T cells in the blood. CONCLUSIONS: Our early-phase data showed that administration of ipilimumab was feasible in patients with recurrent hematologic cancers after allogeneic HSCT, although immune-mediated toxic effects and GVHD occurred. Durable responses were observed in association with several histologic subtypes of these cancers, including extramedullary acute myeloid leukemia.

FBXW7 regulates cellular apoptosis by targeting MCL1 for ubiquitination. Recently, we identified PLK1 as a new substrate of FBXW7 modulating the intra-S-phase DNA-damage checkpoint. Taxanes are frequently used in breast cancer treatments, but the acquisition of resistance makes these treatments ineffective. We investigated the role of FBXW7 and their substrates MCL1 and PLK1 in regulating the apoptotic response to paclitaxel treatment in breast cancer cells and their expression in breast cancer tissues. Paclitaxel-sensitive MDA-MB-468 and a paclitaxel-resistant MDA-MB-468R subclone were used to study the role of FBXW7 and substrates in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. Forced expression of FBXW7 or downregulation of MCL1 or PLK1 restored sensitivity to paclitaxel in MDA-MB-468R cells. By contrary, FBXW7-silenced MDA-MB-468 cells became resistant to paclitaxel. The expression of FBXW7 and substrates were studied in 296 invasive carcinomas by immunohistochemistry and disease-free survival was analyzed in a subset of patients treated with paclitaxel. In breast cancer tissues, loss of FBXW7 correlated with adverse prognosis markers and loss of FBXW7 and MCL1 or PLK1 accumulation were associated with diminished disease-free survival in paclitaxel-treated patients. We conclude that FBXW7 regulates the response to paclitaxel by targeting MCL1 and PLK1 in breast cancer cells and thus targeting these substrates may be a valuable adjunct for paclitaxel treatment. Also, FBXW7, MCL1 and PLK1 may be relevant predictive markers of tumor progression and response to paclitaxel treatment.",,"['Gasca, Jessica', 'Flores, Maria Luz', 'Giraldez, Servando', 'Ruiz-Borrego, Manuel', 'Tortolero, Maria', 'Romero, Francisco', 'Japon, Miguel A', 'Saez, Carmen']","['Gasca J', 'Flores ML', 'Giraldez S', 'Ruiz-Borrego M', 'Tortolero M', 'Romero F', 'Japon MA', 'Saez C']",,"['Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Oncology Unit, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.', 'Instituto de Biomedicina de Sevilla (IBIS), Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Seville, Spain.', 'Department of Pathology, Hospital Universitario Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (polo-like kinase 1)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/*genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Paclitaxel/administration & dosage', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Interference']",PMC5288146,2016/07/14 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10481 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10481 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 16;7(33):52751-52765. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10481.,['NOTNLM'],"['FBXW7', 'MCL1', 'PLK1', 'Pathology Section', 'apoptosis', 'paclitaxel']",,['No potential conflicts of interest were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been previously shown that heat shock (HS) is a potent inducer of HTLV-I viral protein expression in long-term cultured cell lines. However, the precise HTLV-I protein(s) and mechanisms by which HS induces its effect remain ill-defined. We initiated these studies by first monitoring the levels of the trans-activator (Tax) protein induced by exposure of the HTLV-I infected cell line to HS. HS treatment at 43 degrees C for 30 min for 24 h led to marked increases in the level of Tax antigen expression in all HTLV-I-infected T cell lines tested including a number of HTLV-I-naturally infected T cell lines. HS also increased the expression of functional HTLV-I envelope gp46 antigen, as shown by increased syncytium formation activity. Interestingly, the enhancing effect of HS was partially inhibited by the addition of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70)-inhibitor pifithlin-mu (PFT). In contrast, the HSP 70-inducer zerumbone (ZER) enhanced Tax expression in the absence of HS. These data suggest that HSP 70 is at least partially involved in HS-mediated stimulation of Tax expression. As expected, HS resulted in enhanced expression of the Tax-inducible host antigens, such as CD83 and OX40. Finally, we confirmed that HS enhanced the levels of Tax and gp46 antigen expression in primary human CD4(+) T cells isolated from HTLV-I-infected humanized NOD/SCID/gammac null (NOG) mice and HTLV-I carriers. In summary, the data presented herein indicate that HS is one of the environmental factors involved in the reactivation of HTLV-I in vivo via enhanced Tax expression, which may favor HTLV-I expansion in vivo.",,"['Kunihiro, Marie', 'Fujii, Hideki', 'Miyagi, Takuya', 'Takahashi, Yoshiaki', 'Tanaka, Reiko', 'Fukushima, Takuya', 'Ansari, Aftab A', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu']","['Kunihiro M', 'Fujii H', 'Miyagi T', 'Takahashi Y', 'Tanaka R', 'Fukushima T', 'Ansari AA', 'Tanaka Y']",,"['Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. m-kunihiro@emro.co.jp.', 'EM Research Organization Inc., Okinawa, 901-2311, Japan. m-kunihiro@emro.co.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. hfujii@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. miya_skywalker2008@yahoo.co.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. ytakah3@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. reiko_tanaka@s5.dion.ne.jp.', 'Laboratory of Hematoimmunology, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. fukutaku@med.u-ryukyu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA. pathaaa@emory.edu.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, 903-0215, Japan. yuetsu@s4.dion.ne.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160711,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression/*radiation effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', '*Hot Temperature', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'T-Lymphocytes/*radiation effects/*virology']",PMC4974526,2016/07/15 06:00,2017/09/28 06:00,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/28 06:00 [medline]']","['v8070191 [pii]', '10.3390/v8070191 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2016 Jul 11;8(7). pii: v8070191. doi: 10.3390/v8070191.,['NOTNLM'],"['*HTLV-I', '*Tax', '*adult T cell leukemia (ATL)', '*heat shock']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum NSE concentration was higher in ALL patients than in healthy controls. In ALL patients, the mean serum NSE level declined after complete remission (CR) but increased with relapse. In addition, the mean serum NSE level was lower in the CR group than in the non-CR group. High NSE levels were associated with poorer progression-free and overall survival than low NSE levels. Serum NSE levels closely correlated with several clinical features, including the immunophenotype, risk stratification and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Multivariate analysis revealed that high NSE expression was an independent prognostic factor in adult ALL patients.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms at genes associated with methotrexate metabolism on survival. METHODS: The presence of the single nucleotide polymorphisms G80A at reduced folate carrier-1 gene and C677T in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene was determined by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and validated by sequencing. Both single nucleotide polymorphisms were evaluated in 71 healthy donors and in an exploratory pilot trial with acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients to determine the influence of these single nucleotide polymorphisms on clinical outcome. Clinical characteristics, response, and outcome were registered. A Cox regression analysis was done to evaluate factors influencing response and overall survival. RESULTS: There were no differences in the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms between volunteers and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients according to the Hardy-Weinberg test. Sensitivity and specificity were 72 and 91% for the G80A, and 64 and 75% for the C677T, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that the T-immunophenotype and the presence of single nucleotide polymorphism G80A reduced folate carrier-1 were associated with a shorter relapse-free survival and overall survival.

Its occurrence in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndrome and other myeloproliferative neoplasm is uncommon. We here in report a 35-year old lady who was diagnosed as CML-chronic phase (CP) in the year 2004 and was on imatinib (400 mg OD) since then with regular follow up and good compliance. She had progression to accelerated phase in April 2014 which was managed by increasing the dose of imatinib to 600 mg OD. In August 2015, she presented with complaints of pain and swelling of the left shoulder suggestive of septic arthritis. Investigations revealed an ill-defined lesion involving muscles around the shoulder and clavicle. Absence of response to antibiotics and negative work up for infectious etiology raised the suspicion for MS which was later confirmed by immunohistochemistry of the aspirate from the lesion. Bone marrow examination was consistent with CML-CP. Hence, the diagnosis of CML with extra medullary blast crises was made.

Here we report a case of pathological cold agglutinin disease which was eventually detected due to blood group discrepancy. CASE DETAILS: A request was sent to the blood bank for two units of packed red cells in a diagnosed case of CLL which showed type IV discrepancy during blood grouping.The discrepancy was subsequently resolved after warm saline washing of red cells along with repetition of reverse grouping with pre-warmed serum. The direct antiglobulin test was positive and revealed autoanibodies against C3b/C3d only. Indirect antiglobulin test was performed with 3-cell panel in a polyspecific gel card (IgG+C3d) showed a pan-reactive pattern along with a positive autocontrol. Subsequently a cold agglutinin titration was performed and titers of 1024 at 4 degrees C; titer of 2 at room temperature were detected. Dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment of serum was undertaken and IgM type of autoantibody was detected in this case confirming a case of secondary cold agglutinin disease in this patient. Two units of red cells were transfused to this patient after successfully performing cross-match with pre-warmed serum. It was advised from the blood bank that the blood should be transfused slowly through a blood-warmer and patient should be kept in warm condition to avoid in-vivo hemolysis due to high titer of cold agglutinin. The transfusion was uneventful and patient is on regular follow-up till now. CONCLUSION: Thus we concluded that serological discrepancies observed in blood bank can successfully guide the bedside transfusion protocol in case of cold agglutinin disease.",,"['Javed, Rizwan', 'Datta, Suvro Sankha', 'Basu, Sabita', 'Chakrapani, Anupam']","['Javed R', 'Datta SS', 'Basu S', 'Chakrapani A']",,"['Department of Transfusion Medicine, TATA Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, West Bengal 700156 India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, TATA Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, West Bengal 700156 India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, TATA Medical Center, 14 MAR (E-W), New Town, Rajarhat, Kolkata, West Bengal 700156 India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, TATA Medical Center, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160120,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC4925551,2016/07/14 06:00,2016/07/14 06:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2015/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-016-0644-4 [doi]', '644 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2016 Jun;32(Suppl 1):290-3. doi: 10.1007/s12288-016-0644-4.

Acute myeloid leukemia secondary to PV is well reported, and the mechanism has been clarified to some extent. Only a limited number of cases have been reported about the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in the course of PV, and the possible underlying mechanism has not been explored well. CASE PRESENTATION: A 75-year-old patient who developed ALL 3 years after he was diagnosed with PV. The presence of remarkable splenomegaly, typical immunophenotyping of the peripheral blood and increased expression of serum fibrosis markers indicated the existence of extramedullary hematopoiesis which may ascribe to myelofibrosis. After the treatment of dosage-modulated chemotherapy, the patient got complete remission.

Clinical examination showed pallor, generalized lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. For evaluation of his polyuric state he underwent routine laboratory investigations, including renal function test, acid-base studies, urine analysis. Blood tests suggested hypokalemia, hypouricemia, hypocalcemia and hyperchloremia with normal liver and kidney function tests. The arterial blood gas analysis was suggestive of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis. Urine analysis was suggestive of hyperuricosuria, hypercalciuria and glycosuria with a positive urine anion gap. His hemogram showed pancytopenia with differential count showing 88% blasts. Bone marrow examination and flowcytometry confirmed the diagnosis of B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Hence this case was atypical and very interesting in the sense that the Fanconi syndrome is very rare to be an initial presenting feature of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient was started on oral as well intravenous supplementation with potassium, bicarbonate, calcium and phosphorus. Simultaneously, as per the modified BFM -90 protocol (four drug based regimen-Prednisolone, vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide along with l-asparaginase), he was started on induction protocol. By the end of 3rd week of induction therapy, his urine output started normalizing and finally settled at the end of induction therapy.

Present study was undertaken to assess seroprevalence of HTLV in voluntary blood donors along with pattern of blood utilisation. METHODS: A total of 258 healthy blood donors who were free from infectious markers in transfusion as per current transfusion guidelines were enrolled. They were screened for HTLV-I/II antibodies by commercially available enzyme immuno assay (EIA) and their blood utilisation data was analysed. RESULT: Five (1.9%) donors were found seropositive for HTLV-I/II of which 1.2 % were first time and 0.9% were repeat donors. Blood utilisation data revealed 20.9% and 38.8% units were utilised within 5 and 6-14 days of collection respectively. 45.9% recipients were transfused with single blood unit. 42.9% recipients were immunosuppressed due to underlying disease. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of HTLV in blood donors, coupled with single unit transfusion, use of fresh blood, non availability of acellular blood products and immunosuppression in recipients can lead to significant transfusion transmitted HTLV infection. We suggest judicious use of blood products and screening of blood donors in prevention of transfusion transmitted HTLV-I/II.",,"['Chaudhari, C N', 'Shah, T', 'Misra, R N']","['Chaudhari CN', 'Shah T', 'Misra RN']",,"['Classified Specialist (Microbiology), INHS Jeevanti, Vasco-Da-Gama-403802.', 'Ex-Post Graduate Student (Microbiology), INHS Asvini, Colaba, Mumbai.-400005.', 'Commanding Officer, INHS Kalyani, Visakhapatnam.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20110721,India,Med J Armed Forces India,"Medical journal, Armed Forces India",7602492,,,,PMC4921436,2009/01/01 00:00,2009/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2007/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2007/09/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2009/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/S0377-1237(09)80052-X [doi]', 'S0377-1237(09)80052-X [pii]']",ppublish,Med J Armed Forces India. 2009 Jan;65(1):38-40. doi: 10.1016/S0377-1237(09)80052-X.

In this report we describe a patient with CLL, who developed a clonally-related pleomorphic highly-aggressive mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after five cycles of a fludarabine-based second-line therapy for the first relapse of CLL. Molecular cytogenetic methods together with whole-exome sequencing revealed numerous gene alterations restricted to the MCL clone (apart from the canonical t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation) including gain of one copy of ATM gene or emergence of TP53, CREBBP, NUP214, FUBP1 and SF3B1 gene mutations. Similarly, gene expression analysis revealed vast differences between the MCL and CLL transcriptome, including overexpression of cyclin D1, downregulation of cyclins D2 and D3, or downregulation of IL4R in the MCL clone. Backtracking analysis using quantitative PCR specifically detecting an MCL-restricted focal deletion of TP53 revealed that the pre-MCL clone appeared in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of the patient approximately 4 years before the clinical manifestation of MCL. Both molecular cytogenetic and sequencing data support the hypothesis of a slow development of the pre-MCL clone in parallel to CLL over several years, and thereby exclude the possibility that the transformation event occurred at the stage of the CLL relapse clone by mere t(11;14)(q13;q32) acquisition.",['(c) 2016 UICC.'],"['Klener, Pavel', 'Fronkova, Eva', 'Berkova, Adela', 'Jaksa, Radek', 'Lhotska, Halka', 'Forsterova, Kristina', 'Soukup, Jan', 'Kulvait, Vojtech', 'Vargova, Jarmila', 'Fiser, Karel', 'Prukova, Dana', 'Alam, Mahmudul', 'Calvin Lenyeletse Maswabi, Bokang', 'Michalova, Kyra', 'Zemanova, Zuzana', 'Jancuskova, Tereza', 'Pekova, Sona', 'Trneny, Marek']","['Klener P', 'Fronkova E', 'Berkova A', 'Jaksa R', 'Lhotska H', 'Forsterova K', 'Soukup J', 'Kulvait V', 'Vargova J', 'Fiser K', 'Prukova D', 'Alam M', 'Calvin Lenyeletse Maswabi B', 'Michalova K', 'Zemanova Z', 'Jancuskova T', 'Pekova S', 'Trneny M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Charles University General Hospital Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. pavel.klener@gmail.com.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. pavel.klener@gmail.com.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Faculty Hospital Motol Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology, Charles University General Hospital Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Charles University General Hospital Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, Second Faculty of Medicine, Faculty Hospital Motol Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Childhood Leukemia Investigation Prague (CLIP), Faculty Hospital Motol Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Oncocytogenetics, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Synlab Genetics, Department of Cytogenetics, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Synlab Genetics, Department of Cytogenetics, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Hematology, Charles University General Hospital Prague, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160802,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,2016/07/14 06:00,2017/04/25 06:00,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/18 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.30263 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2016 Nov 15;139(10):2252-60. doi: 10.1002/ijc.30263.

It can spread to different parts of the body rapidly and if not treated, would probably be deadly within a couple of months. Leukemia cells are categorized into three types of L1, L2, and L3. The cancer is detected through screening of blood and bone marrow smears by pathologists. But manual examination of blood samples is a time-consuming and boring procedure as well as limited by human error risks. So to overcome these limitations a computer-aided detection system, capable of discriminating cancer from noncancer cases and identifying the cancerous cell subtypes, seems to be necessary. In this article an automatic detection method is proposed; first cell nucleus is segmented by fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. Then a rich set of features including geometric, first- and second-order statistical features are obtained from the nucleus. A principal component analysis is used to reduce feature matrix dimensionality. Finally, an ensemble of SVM classifiers with different kernels and parameters is applied to classify cells into four groups, that is noncancerous, L1, L2, and L3. Results show that the proposed method can be used as an assistive diagnostic tool in laboratories.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['MoradiAmin, Morteza', 'Memari, Ahmad', 'Samadzadehaghdam, Nasser', 'Kermani, Saeed', 'Talebi, Ardeshir']","['MoradiAmin M', 'Memari A', 'Samadzadehaghdam N', 'Kermani S', 'Talebi A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5027-3416'],"['Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Electrical Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran Branch, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS), Tehran, Iran. nsamadzadeh_a@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Faculty of Advanced Medical Technology, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160713,United States,Microsc Res Tech,Microscopy research and technique,9203012,,IM,"['Humans', 'Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Microscopy/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/*diagnostic imaging', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Support Vector Machine']",,2016/07/14 06:00,2018/02/27 06:00,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jemt.22718 [doi]'],ppublish,Microsc Res Tech. 2016 Oct;79(10):908-916. doi: 10.1002/jemt.22718.

Since many genetic alterations resulting in the onset of disease are now detectable using PCR, it can be used as both a diagnostic and prognostic tool. Genetic changes can occur in DNA due to mutation, deletion, inversion or chromosomal translocation. As a consequence, genes become either non functional or are aberrantly expressed. Research in recent years has now associated many defined genetic abnormalities with specific diseases. Therefore detection and surveillance of such lesions has led to disease diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of disease progression, for example, during and after administration of therapeutic regimens. The major effect of PCR in this area is that genetically abnormal cells can be detected within a normal cell population at a far lower incidence level than any other existing technology. Moreover, PCR can be used to identify naturally existing genetic polymorphisms that can be used as personal identifiers, or tags, for a given individual. Where these polymorphisms occur within a genetically modified region resulting in disease, identification of the polymorphism within families can be used as a predictor of disease carrier status or likelihood of inheritance of the disease.",,"['Allen, P', 'Phillips, C', 'Wilkes, S', 'Wright, G', 'Newland, A']","['Allen P', 'Phillips C', 'Wilkes S', 'Wright G', 'Newland A']",,"[""a Department of Haematology , St Bartholomews' and The Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry , Turner Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AD."", ""a Department of Haematology , St Bartholomews' and The Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry , Turner Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AD."", ""a Department of Haematology , St Bartholomews' and The Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry , Turner Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AD."", ""a Department of Haematology , St Bartholomews' and The Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry , Turner Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AD."", ""a Department of Haematology , St Bartholomews' and The Royal London Hospital School of Medicine and Dentistry , Turner Street, Whitechapel, London E1 2AD.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1997.11746344 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1997;2(3):249-56. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1997.11746344.,['NOTNLM'],"['Polymerase chain reaction', 'leukemia', 'minimal residual disease', 'principles']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is evidenced by the observations of a reduced risk of leukaemia relapse after allogeneic BMT when compared with autologous or syngeneic BMT. Furthermore, an increased incidence of leukaemic relapse has been reported after aggressive GvHD prophylaxis with cyclosporin or lymphocyte depletion. The association between GvHD and the graft-versus-leukaemia activity of allogeneic BMT is strong and has led to a number of workers concluding that GvL might be inseparable from GvHD although there is increasing evidence that this is not so. The lymphocyte subsets responsible for GvHD and GvL remain to be elucidated in man despite intensive efforts. Certainly T cells, natural killer cells and a population of in vivo activated killer cells are involved in GvL and an effective immune response probably requires a combined approach. The target antigens of GvL are also controversial. The majority of GvL studies have been conducted in the allogeneic transplant setting in which activity to leukaemia-specific peptides is easily masked by reactivity to undetected MHC mismatches and to minor histocompatibility antigens. Despite this the search for leukaemia-specific peptides has been fruitful in the case of the product of the BCR/ABL translocation in CML. The ultimate aim of a number of groups in all aspects of oncology is the development of effective and specific immunotherapy. A variety of approaches have been attempted over the last 80 years, including vaccination with irradiated leukaemic blasts and numerous trials of interleukin-2. We now know more about the mechanisms of induction of immunity than ever before and this knowledge, combined with sophisticated molecular biology and virology, promises to revolutionise the immunotherapy of leukaemia over the next ten years.",,"['Lowdell, M W', 'Craston, R', 'Prentice, H G']","['Lowdell MW', 'Craston R', 'Prentice HG']",,"['a Department of Haematology , Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine , London , UK.', 'a Department of Haematology , Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine , London , UK.', 'a Department of Haematology , Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine , London , UK.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1997.11746336 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1997;2(3):193-201. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1997.11746336.,['NOTNLM'],"['GvHD', 'GvL', 'Leukaemia', 'immunotherapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the impressive and sustained response to TKI therapy that the majority of treated patients with CML enjoy, recent studies have explored the potential to achieve treatment-free remission in select patients, which may allow these patients to escape the adverse clinical and financial effects associated with life-long TKI therapy. The results of multiple prospective trials have demonstrated that patients who maintain a deep molecular response for at least 2 years with TKI treatment may be eligible for trial of TKI discontinuation. Mounting data indicates that approximately 40% of those who discontinue therapy on trial will remain in remission at least 1 year after TKI discontinuation; the majority of patients with molecular recurrence relapse within the first 6 months after TKI discontinuation, and TKI retreatment is highly effective in restoring response. Sokol score, duration of TKI therapy, depth of molecular response, and the presence of natural killer cells may all be associated with a higher probability of attaining treatment-free remission. Moving forward, emerging data from ongoing TKI discontinuation trials will allow for appropriate selection of patients with CML eligible for this approach, will expand our current understanding of the CML stem cell, and identify therapeutic interventions capable of effectively deleting the malignant hematopoietic stem cell.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Cells overcome the senescence mechanisms by stabilising telomere length, probably due to the activity of telomerase that specifically elongates telomeres. The striking observation that almost all malignant cancers have telomerase activity indicate that there is intensive selective pressure of telomerase activation with the progression of malignancy. Indirect support for this view is that benign or pre-cancerous lesions are telomerase silent. The fact that telomerase activity is observed in over 85% of human primary malignancies raises the possibilities that it may be a new marker of cancer with diagnostic and therapeutic potentials. Can such ideas be applied to leukaemias and preleukaemias? Since normal haematopoietic stem cells and their progeny express telomerase activity, it is important to consider whether or not telomere shortening and telomerase activity play any role in leukaemic progression. Telomere reduction has been observed in various leukaemias including in ALL, AML, transformed leukaemias from MDS and late stage of CML and CLL and might be indicative of the length of the disease. Elevated telomerase activity has also been found in ALL, AML, CML and CLL. In AML, patients with chromosomal abnormalities 11q, -5, -7 had higher telomerase activity and unfavourable prognosis; while those with favourable cytogenetics such as t(8:21), inversion 16 showed low levels of telomerase.

The major cause of mortality and morbidity are thromboembolic complications, which occur more frequently in older subjects or in those with a previous thrombosis. The therapeutic options comprise cytoreductive agents (cytotoxic drugs, interferon, anagrelide) and anti-aggregating drugs. In clinical practice the choice of treatment primarily takes into account the patient's age, history and symptoms. The use of platelet-lowering agents is indicated in patients above 60 years and in those with a history of thrombosis or major bleeding, or very high platelet count (e.g. >1,000 X 10(9)/1). Hydroxyurea has emerged as the treatment of choice after the recent demonstration of its efficacy in reducing not only the platelet count but also thromboembolic complications. Low-dose aspirin may be added in the presence of thrombosis or microvascular disturbances. In younger, asymptomatic patients, an initial policy of observation, without specific treatment, or with only low-dose antiaggregating agents seems reasonable.

A small percentage of patients transform to acute leukaemia, particularly after myelofibrotic transformation. Leukaemic transformation is enhanced with some forms of myelosuppression, notably high accumulated doses of chlorambucil and (32)P. Venesection should be used initially to reduce the PCV and subsequently as required. The choice of myelosuppressive agent depend on the patients age.

However, in the longer run, many of these regimens are associated with a significant incidence of secondary haematologic malignancies. This study further defines this occurrence. The records from 2196 consecutive patients with lymphoreticular neoplasms were retrospectively reviewed. In each case management was on a standard chemotherapy or irradiation protocol, approved by institutional review committees, and based on histopathology coupled with clinical stage at presentation. Diagnosis of myelodysplasia or acute leukaemia was made according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. From 1970 to 1990, 475 individuals with Hodgkin's Disease, and a further 1721 with other malignant lymphomas, were treated. Myelodysplasia developed in 4, acute myeloblastic leukaemia in 6, possible acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in 1 and, in the remaining case, precise characterization was not possible. Of these twelve patients, comprising 0.5% of the study cohort, 5 (1.1%) had Hodgkin's Disease and seven (0.4%) other lymphoreticular tumours. The median age was sixty-eight (range 33 to 81) years; seven were male. The median latent period from therapy to onset of the secondary neoplasms was 5.6 years (range 1-15.6). Treatment was possible in four of the twelve: two achieved complete remission but relapsed, two had only partial response. None survived fourteen months.

Whilst it is important to recognise congenital deficiencies of naturally occurring anticoagulant proteins, their incidence is often unknown in any given hospitalized population. To examine this controversy, a case controlled study was undertaken to correlate venous thromboembolism at our institution with laboratory tests of haemostasis and to define those having predictive value for this event. Patients with the clinical diagnosis of DVT were divided into those having venographic confirmation (Group 1; n = 106) and a matching series where these studies were negative (Group 2: n = 74). The most frequent associations with DVT were the confirmed diagnosis of severe pulmonary tuberculosis (n = 30), carcinoma (n = 13) and surgery (n = 6); no proven case of a congenital factor deficiency was documented. Comparison of laboratory data from groups 1 and 2 showed, respectively, higher levels of fibrinogen, being 4.6 +/- 0.8 g/L versus 3.16 +/- 1.12 g/L (p < 0.05), fibrin(ogen) degradation products (FDP) of 11.5 +/- 8.3 mug/ml versus 1.4 +/- 1.63 (p < 0.01), and tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA) 26.5 +/- 14.5 versus 12.1 +/- 11.2 (p < 0.01). Decreased levels of several coagulation inhibitory proteins were seen only in association with clinical and haematologic evidence of multisystem disease with coagulopathy. No isolated deficiencies of these proteins were observed, even in the small group of idiopathic recurrent venous thrombosis in this series. Increased plasma fibrinogen, FDP, and plasminogen activator antigen levels may indicate the presence of DVT in individuals at risk, and in the case of pulmonary tuberculosis may be associated with a potential hypercoagulable state.",,"['Robson, S C', 'Bird, A', 'Kossew, B', 'Goodman, H', 'White, N', 'Jacobs, P']","['Robson SC', 'Bird A', 'Kossew B', 'Goodman H', 'White N', 'Jacobs P']",,"['d the MRC-UCT Liver Centre , Groote Schuur Hospital , Observatory, Cape, South Africa.', 'a From the University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Departments of Haematology.', 'a From the University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Departments of Haematology.', 'b Diagnostic Radiology.', 'c Medicine.', 'a From the University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre and the Departments of Haematology.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1996.11746282 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1996;1(1):27-32. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1996.11746282.,['NOTNLM'],"['Clinical Predisposition', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Haemostasis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among malignancy- and bone marrow transplant-associated infections, the lungs are the most common site of infection. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract is less frequently encountered. The clinical presentation is often nonspecific, and cultures typically yield no growth, making the diagnosis challenging. CASE REPORT We present a case of isolated hepatic mucormycosis in the setting of neutropenic fever and abdominal pain following induction chemotherapy for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was treated with combination antifungal therapy with amphotericin and posaconazole without surgical resection, given the presence of multiple liver lesions. After a prolonged course of dual antifungal therapy, the size of her liver lesions improved. Unfortunately, her lymphoproliferative disorder proved fatal, following approximately 13 months of antifungal therapy. CONCLUSIONS Among patients with mucormycosis, mortality remains high, especially in the setting of gastrointestinal involvement. Although surgical resection along with dual antifungal therapy can improve outcomes, the high mortality rate necessitates further investigation into improved diagnostic and treatment strategies including optimal antifungal therapy.",,"['Bernardo, Raffaele M', 'Gurung, Ananta', 'Jain, Dhanpat', 'Malinis, Maricar F']","['Bernardo RM', 'Gurung A', 'Jain D', 'Malinis MF']",,"['Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Section of Infectious Diseases, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20160713,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*adverse effects', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Liver Diseases/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/*complications/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Triazoles/therapeutic use']",PMC4948661,2016/07/14 06:00,2017/03/21 06:00,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/21 06:00 [medline]']","['898480 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.898480 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2016 Jul 13;17:484-9. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.898480.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coagulation abnormalities (PT 73.1%, APTT 39.4 s, FDP 235mg/dl) were observed 72 h before onset. Echocardiography revealed a large thrombus in a right ventricle. A diagnosis of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) was made, and a tissue-type plasminogen activator (monteplase) was administered under percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS). The complete lysis of thrombus was confirmed by an echocardiogram 8 h later. Symptoms and ABG data were also improved. PTE in adult AML cases is rare, but should be considered as one of the life-threatening complications in AML patients under chemotherapy who develop respiratory difficulties.

An abundance of residual leukemic cells and poor performance status of patients before allo-BMT are often associated with a high relapse rate and high transplant-related mortality. Thus, to improve the prognosis of patients with refractory AML undergoing allo-BMT, it is necessary to reduce the leukemic cell volume as low as possible without severe complications. In this report, we used CAG (cytarabine, aclarubicin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)) therapy for cytoreduction before allo-BMT or allo-PBSCT in five patients with refractory AML. One of them achieved complete remission (CR) by CAG therapy alone and others achieved major tumor reduction prior to BMT and PBSCT. All patients achieved CR after allo-BMT and allo-PBSCT without severe complications. Three of them have remained CR for 9, 21 and 30 months, respectively.

The abnormal sensitivity is explained by a lack of complement regulatory membrane proteins such as decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55) and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis (MIRL, CD59), which are covalently linked to the erythrocyte membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. The deficiency of the membrane proteins is caused by a synthetic defect in this anchor caused by impaired transfer of N- acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PIns) [2]. Mutations of the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) gene have been shown to contribute this abnormality in nearly all patients with PNH studied to date [4]. Recently, several reviews have been presented on various aspects of PNH [5-10]. This review focuses particularly on the recent elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of GPI-anchor deficiency on PNH and related hematopoietic stem cell disorders.",,"['Lin, L I', 'Chen, Y C', 'Lin, J K']","['Lin LI', 'Chen YC', 'Lin JK']",,"['a Institute of Biochemistry, School of Medical Technology , Department of Laboratory Medicine , College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.', 'a Institute of Biochemistry, School of Medical Technology , Department of Laboratory Medicine , College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.', 'a Institute of Biochemistry, School of Medical Technology , Department of Laboratory Medicine , College of Medicine, National Taiwan University.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1997.11746361 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1997;2(5):399-406. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1997.11746361.,['NOTNLM'],"['PIG-A gene', 'Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)', 'glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These changes may consist of long arm deletion (7q-) or total loss of the whole chromosome (monosomy 7) from bone marrow cells [1, 4, 6-24] and was first reported in association with myeloid disease in 1964 with the report of 3 cases of refractory anaemia, granulocytic hyperplasia [25]. The association between chromosome 7 alterations, MDS and AML in children and adults is clear, however, a rare association with lymphoid malignancies has also been recently reported. The abnormalities may occur in de novo MDS/AML, secondary cases following exposure to drugs, radiotherapy and toxins and in addition in a range of constitutional disorders including Fanconi's anaemia, congenital neutropenia and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The broad spread of conditions in which this consistent genetic change can occur leads one to speculate that there is an underlying instability in chromosome 7 and that genes on this chromosome play a role in the development of malignancy. The loss of DNA associated with malignant progression suggests the presence of a tumour suppressor gene (or genes) [26, 27]. Patients with monosomy 7 usually present as classical MDS with abnormal erythroid, megakaryocyte and myeloid differentiation [7, 28]. From a mechanistic perspective, increased cell proliferation and apoptosis is a common feature possibly induced by the failure of normal haematopoietic maturation. In all groups the presence of chromosome 7 abnormalities defines a poor prognostic group [29]. The majority of patients with MDS transform to a form of acute leukaemia resistant to therapy, including bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) has accelerated the study of these disorders at the cytogenetic and molecular levels, [4, 30, 31, 32, 33] no gene has been clearly implicated. A few candidate genes are under investigation. While the loss of chromsome 7 material is crutial in the malignant process it is almost certainly not the primary molecular abnormality. An initiating event genetic event predisposing to chromosome breakage and loss probably occurs in haematopoietic cells permitting chromosome 7 loss and progression to clonal malignancy as a secondary event.",,"['Cotter, F E', 'Johnson, E']","['Cotter FE', 'Johnson E']",,"['a Molecular Haematology Unit , Institute of Child Health , 30 Guilford Street, London , WC1N 1EH.', 'a Molecular Haematology Unit , Institute of Child Health , 30 Guilford Street, London , WC1N 1EH.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1997.11746356 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1997;2(5):359-72. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1997.11746356.,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FISH', 'Myelodysplasia', 'chromosome 7', 'congenital anaemias', 'molecular genetics', 'therapy related']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For each of the 1,093 cases, three age- and gender matched controls were selected (N = 3,279).

Complete residential histories and previously collected survey data of the background gamma radiation in Finland were used to assess the exposure of the study subjects to indoor and outdoor gamma radiation. Overall, background gamma radiation showed a non-significant association with the OR of childhood leukemia (OR 1.01, 95% CI 0.97, 1.05 for 10 nSv/h increase in average equivalent dose rate to red bone marrow). In subgroup analyses, age group 2-<7 years displayed a larger effect (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.01, 1.60 for 1 mSv increase in equivalent cumulative dose to red bone marrow). Suggestive difference in OR by genetic subtype was found.

In addition, the effects of the retinoid 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cis RA) were assessed alone or in combination with the vitamin D compounds. In both the HL-60 and U937 cell lines none of the vitamin D derivatives alone were capable of inducing apoptosis, as assessed by flow cytometry and cell death ELISA techniques. In contrast, 9-cis RA induced apoptosis in HL-60 but not U937 cells. Co-treatment of HL-60 cells with the vitamin D compounds and 9-cis RA resulted in an enhanced induction of apoptosis, which was not observed with U937 cell co-treatment. Western analysis of bcl-2 and bax protein levels revealed that combinations of the vitamin D and retinoid compounds decreased bcl-2 in HL-60 but not U937 cells, suggesting a change in the bcl-2/bax heterodimeric ratio in the former which would favour apoptosis. Further Western analyses were performed to examine the regulation of vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) following single or co-treatment with their respective ligands. Studies revealed that 9-cis RA alone down-regulated RXR, and diminished VDR and RAR protein levels in the presence of the vitamin D compounds in both cell lines. However, in HL-60 cells the vitamin D derivatives were capable of preventing the further down-regulation of RXR in the presence of the retinoid. These results demonstrate cell specific responses to the induction of apoptosis and regulation of apoptosis related gene products by vitamin D and retinoid compounds, highlighting complex signalling interactions between their receptors.",,"['James, S Y', 'Turner, A', 'Colston, K W']","['James SY', 'Turner A', 'Colston KW']",,"['a Divisions of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and Metabolism.', ""b Medical Oncology , St. George's Hospital Medical School , London , SW17 ORE."", 'a Divisions of Gastroenterology, Endocrinology and Metabolism.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,,,,1997/01/01 00:00,1997/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/14 06:00'],"['2016/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '1997/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1997/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1080/10245332.1997.11746348 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 1997;2(4):289-301. doi: 10.1080/10245332.1997.11746348.,['NOTNLM'],"['9-cis retinoic acid', 'RXR', 'VDR', 'Vitamin D analogues', 'apoptosis', 'bcl-2']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several ABCB1 single nucleotide polymorphisms affect the transporter activity. The most common ABCB1 variants are 1236C > T, 2677G > T, 3435C > T and have been associated with clinical response to imatinib in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in some studies. We evaluated the impact of these polymorphisms on the anti-proliferative effect and the intracellular accumulation of TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib and ponatinib) in transfected HEK293 and K562 cells. ABCB1 overexpression increased the resistance of cells to doxorubicin, vinblastine and TKIs. Imatinib anti-proliferative effect and accumulation were decreased to a larger extent in cells expressing the ABCB1 wild-type protein compared with the 1236T-2677T-3435T variant relatively to control cells. By contrast, ABCB1 polymorphisms influenced the activity of nilotinib, dasatinib and ponatinib to a much lesser extent. In conclusion, our data suggest that wild-type ABCB1 exports imatinib more efficiently than the 1236T-2677T-3435T variant protein, providing a molecular basis for the reported association between ABCB1 polymorphisms and the response to imatinib in CML.

The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)-cofactor gene B cell leukemia-3 (Bcl-3) plays a critical role in altering the transcriptional capacity of NF-kappaB - a key inducer of inflammation - but also of genes involved in cellular energy metabolism. METHODS: To define the role of Bcl-3 in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we developed a novel transgenic mouse model with hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 (Bcl-3(Hep)) and employed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate dietary feeding model. To characterize the transgenic model, deep RNA sequencing was performed. The relevance of the findings was confirmed in human liver samples. RESULTS: Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Bcl-3 led to pronounced metabolic derangement, characterized by enhanced hepatic steatosis from increased de novo lipogenesis and uptake, as well as decreased hydrolysis and export of fatty acids. Steatosis in Bcl-3(Hep) mice was accompanied by an augmented inflammatory milieu and liver cell injury. Moreover, Bcl-3 expression decreased insulin sensitivity and resulted in compensatory regulation of insulin-signaling pathways. Based on in vivo and in vitro studies we identified the transcription factors PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PGC-1alpha as critical regulators of hepatic metabolism and inflammation downstream of Bcl-3. Metformin treatment improved the metabolic and inflammatory phenotype in Bcl-3(Hep) mice through modulation of PPARalpha and PGC-1alpha. Remarkably, these findings were recapitulated in human NASH, which exhibited increased expression and nuclear localization of Bcl-3. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Bcl-3 emerges as a novel regulator of hepatic steatosis, insulin sensitivity and inflammation in NASH. LAY SUMMARY: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most prevalent liver disease worldwide. Patients can develop end-stage liver disease resulting in liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, but also develop complications unrelated to liver disease, e.g., cardiovascular disease. Still there is no full understanding of the mechanisms that cause NAFLD. In this study, genetically engineered mice were employed to examine the role of a specific protein in the liver that is involved in inflammation and the metabolism, namely Bcl-3. By this approach, a better understanding of the mechanisms contributing to disease progression was established. This can help to develop novel therapeutic and diagnostic options for patients with NAFLD.","['Copyright (c) 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

Sea cucumbers are one of the marine animals of the phylum Echinoderm. Many studies have shown that the sea cucumber contains antioxidants and anti-cancer compounds. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease characterized by the relentless accumulation of CD5(+) B lymphocytes. CLL is the most common leukemia in adults, about 25-30% of all leukemias. In this study B lymphocytes and their mitochondria (cancerous and non-cancerous) were obtained from peripheral blood of human subjects and B lymphocyte cytotoxicity assay, and caspase 3 activation along with mitochondrial upstream events of apoptosis signaling including reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial swelling were determined following the addition of Holothuria parva extract to both cancerous and non-cancerous B lymphocytes and their mitochondria. Our in vitro finding showed that mitochondrial ROS formation, MMP collapse, and mitochondrial swelling and cytochrome c release were significantly (P < 0.05) increased after addition of different concentrations of H. parva only in cancerous BUT NOT normal non-cancerous mitochondria. Consistently, different concentrations of H. parva significantly (P < 0.05) increased cytotoxicity and caspase 3 activation only in cancerous BUT NOT normal non-cancerous B lymphocytes.

Unfortunately, outcomes for patients presenting in an advanced stage-accelerated phase or blast crisis CML-continues to be poor, requiring chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) to attempt cure. Integration of TKIs in the therapy of advanced CML is still an area of active investigation. There are little published data on TKI use in children with advanced stage CML. We performed a retrospective review of all children treated at our institution between January 1, 2010 and June 30, 2013, and identified 5 children, age 12 to 18 years, with advanced stage CML. All patients were treated with a TKI before HSCT and TKIs were restarted post-HSCT in 4/5 with a goal of continuing until 2 years posttransplant. At time of HSCT all were in a morphologic and cytogenetic remission; 1 patient had also achieved molecular remission. All patients are alive and in molecular remission at an average of 38 months (range, 14 to 51 mo) following transplant.

Retroviruses utilize the cellular vesiculation pathway for virus budding/assembly and the retrovirus Gag protein induces the spontaneous formation of microvesicles or virus-like particles (VLPs) when expressed in the mammalian cells. In this study, five different melanoma antigens, MAGEA4, MAGEA10, MART1, TRP1 and MCAM, were incorporated into the VLPs and their localization within the particles was determined. Our data show that the MAGEA4 and MAGEA10 proteins as well as MCAM are expressed on the surface of VLPs. The compartmentalization of exogenously expressed cancer antigens within the VLPs did not depend on the localization of the protein within the cell. Comparison of the protein content of VLPs by LC-MS/MS-based label-free quantitative proteomics showed that VLPs carrying different cancer antigens are very similar to each other, but differ to some extent from VLPs without recombinant antigen.

The role of inter-individual genetic variation in influencing DNA methylation, leading to the possibility of confounding or bias of such associations, has not been assessed. We investigated whether the DNA methylation levels at the top 10 CpG sites previously associated with exposure to maternal smoking during gestation were associated with individual genetic variation at the genome-wide level. Genome-wide association tests between DNA methylation at the top 10 candidate CpG and genome-wide SNPs were performed in 736 case and control participants of the California Childhood Leukemia Study. Three of the strongest maternal-smoking sensitive CpG sites in newborns were significantly associated with SNPs located proximal to each gene: cg18146737 in the GFI1 gene with rs141819830 (P = 8.2x10(-44)), cg05575921 in the AHRR gene with rs148405299 (P = 5.3x10(-10)), and cg12803068 in the MYO1G gene with rs61087368 (P = 1.3x10(-18)). For the GFI1 CpG cg18146737, the underlying genetic variation at rs141819830 confounded the association between maternal smoking and DNA methylation in our data (the regression coefficient changed from -0.02 [P = 0.139] to -0.03 [P = 0.015] after including the genotype). Our results suggest that further studies using DNA methylation at cg18146737, cg05575921, or cg12803068 that aim to assess exposure to maternal smoking during gestation should include genotype at the corresponding SNP.

To address the impact of maternal and neonatal Fe status and hepcidin on the regulation of these proteins, mRNA expression and protein abundance of nonheme and heme Fe transport proteins were evaluated in placental tissue from 154 adolescents. Regression analyses found maternal Fe status was significantly associated with multiple placental nonheme and heme transporters, whereas neonatal Fe status was related to only 3 heme transporters. Across statistical analyses, maternal Fe status was consistently associated with the placental nonheme Fe importer transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1). Protein abundance of TfR1 was related to midgestation maternal serum ferritin (SF) (beta = -0.32; P = 0.005) and serum TfR (beta = 0.25; P = 0.024). Protein abundance of the heme importer, proton-coupled folate transporter, was related to neonatal SF (beta = 0.30; P = 0.016) and serum TfR (beta = -0.46; P < 0.0001). Neonatal SF was also related to mRNA expression of the heme exporter feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 (beta = -0.30; P = 0.004). In summary, maternal Fe insufficiency during pregnancy predicts increased expression of the placental nonheme Fe transporter TfR1.

Among others, the DNA damage theory of aging of HSCs is well established, based on the detection of a significantly larger amount of gammaH2AX foci and a higher tail moment in the comet assay, both initially thought to be associated with DNA damage in aged HSCs compared with young cells, and bone marrow failure in animals devoid of DNA repair factors. Novel data on the increase in and nature of DNA mutations in the hematopoietic system with age, the quality of the DNA damage response in aged HSCs, and the nature of gammaH2AX foci question a direct link between DNA damage and the DNA damage response and aging of HSCs, and rather favor changes in epigenetics, splicing-factors or three-dimensional architecture of the cell as major cell intrinsic factors of HSCs aging. Aging of HSCs is also driven by a strong contribution of aging of the niche. This review discusses the DNA damage theory of HSC aging in the light of these novel mechanisms of aging of HSCs.","['Copyright (c) 2016 ISEH - International Society for Experimental Hematology.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Infections are the main cause of morbidity and mortality in multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Recent advances in treatment have prolonged the duration of remission and the time between relapse phases in MM and CLL patients. However, managing multiple relapses and the use of salvage therapies can lead to cumulative immunosuppression and a higher risk of infections. The pathogenesis of immune deficiency secondary to lymphoproliferative malignancy is multifactorial including disease- and treatment-related factors. Supportive treatment, including early vaccination, anti-infective prophylaxis, and replacement immunoglobulin, plays a key role in preventing infections in MM and CLL. This article provides an overview of the basic immunology necessary to understand the pathogenesis of secondary immunodeficiency and the infectious complications in MM and CLL. We also discuss the evidence supporting the role of prophylactic replacement immunoglobulin treatment in patients with antibody failure secondary to MM and CLL and the indications for its use.

Hence, it is not paradoxical that, similar to their normal counterparts, most mature B cell lymphoma subtypes are critically dependent on microenvironmental cues. Such external signals are sensed by various receptors present on the malignant cells, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), eliciting a range of cellular responses, including proliferation but also anergy and apoptosis, often with disease-specific patterns. Critically, the TLR signaling pathways are intertwined with other receptor pathways in malignant B cells, most notably the B-cell receptor pathway, and converge on NF-kappaB, leading to its activation. In the present review, we summarize the literature on TLR expression and functionality and its impact on NF-kappaB activation in different B cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia where TLR9 induces activation, cell proliferation and chemoresistance in a proportion of patients while apoptosis can be induced in others. Additionally, we also discuss the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting TLR signaling in lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a complete understanding of how HTLV-1 transforms T cells is lacking. Expression of the chemokine receptor CCR4 on ATL cells and HTLV-1-infected cells suggested the hypothesis that CCR4 may mediate features of ATL and inflammatory diseases caused by HTLV-1. In this study, we show that the constitutively expressed HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) encoded by HTLV-1 is responsible for inducing CCR4 and its ability to promote T-cell proliferation and migration. Ectopic expression of HBZ was sufficient to stimulate expression of CCR4 in human and mouse T cells. Conversely, HBZ silencing in ATL cell lines was sufficient to inhibit CCR4 expression. Mechanistic investigations showed that HBZ induced GATA3 expression in CD4(+) T cells, thereby activating transcription from the CCR4 promoter. In an established air pouch model of ATL, we observed that CD4(+) T cells of HBZ transgenic mice (HBZ-Tg mice) migrated preferentially to the pouch, as compared with those in nontransgenic mice. Migration of CD4(+) T cells in HBZ-Tg mice was inhibited by treatment with a CCR4 antagonist. Proliferating (Ki67(+)) CD4(+) T cells were found to express high levels of CCR4 and CD103. Further, CD4(+) T-cell proliferation in HBZ-Tg mice was enhanced by coordinate treatment with the CCR4 ligands CCL17 and 22 and with the CD103 ligand E-cadherin. Consistent with this finding, we found that ATL cells in clinical skin lesions were frequently positive for CCR4, CD103, and Ki67. Taken together, our results show how HBZ activates CCR4 expression on T cells to augment their migration and proliferation, two phenomena linked to HTLV-1 pathogenesis. Cancer Res; 76(17); 5068-79.

Hydroxyurea (HU) is the most frequently used cytoreductive agent in PV. However, approximately 24% of patients treated with HU will eventually develop resistance or intolerance and patients who fail HU have an increased risk of death, transformation to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia. Interferon-alpha has been used in younger PV patients and is capable of inducing a complete hematologic response and significant reductions, or even eradication, of JAK2 V617F mutation allele burdens in a small but notable subset of PV patients. The potential toxicities of interferon-alpha must be weighed against the disease control benefit in a case-by-case fashion. Recently JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib, demonstrated significant improvement in controlling the hematocrit and splenomegaly versus best available therapy in patients with PV who failed or are intolerant to HU and currently is FDA-approved in this setting.

Loss-of-function mutations in EZH2 are associated with poorer outcomes in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), particularly those with primary myelofibrosis (MF [PMF]). To determine how EZH2 insufficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of PMF, we generated mice compound for an Ezh2 conditional deletion and activating mutation in JAK2 (JAK2V617F) present in patients with PMF. The deletion of Ezh2 in JAK2(V617F) mice markedly promoted the development of MF, indicating a tumor suppressor function for EZH2 in PMF. The loss of Ezh2 in JAK2(V617F) hematopoietic cells caused significant reductions in H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) levels, resulting in an epigenetic switch to H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac). These epigenetic switches were closely associated with the activation of PRC2 target genes including Hmga2, an oncogene implicated in the pathogenesis of PMF. The treatment of JAK2(V617F)/Ezh2-null mice with a bromodomain inhibitor significantly attenuated H3K27ac levels at the promoter regions of PRC2 targets and down-regulated their expression, leading to the abrogation of MF-initiating cells. Therefore, an EZH2 insufficiency not only cooperated with active JAK2 to induce MF, but also conferred an oncogenic addiction to the H3K27ac modification in MF-initiating cells that was capable of being restored by bromodomain inhibition.",['(c) 2016 Sashida et al.'],"['Sashida, Goro', 'Wang, Changshan', 'Tomioka, Takahisa', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Mochizuki-Kashio, Makiko', 'Harada, Hironori', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Iwama, Atsushi']","['Sashida G', 'Wang C', 'Tomioka T', 'Oshima M', 'Aoyama K', 'Kanai A', 'Mochizuki-Kashio M', 'Harada H', 'Shimoda K', 'Iwama A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2318-5987', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6719-2444', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7525-0851', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3963-0013', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2136-4562']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Chuo-ku, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan sashidag@kumamoto-u.ac.jp aiwama@faculty.chiba-u.jp.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan College of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot 010021, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Leukemia Program Project, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Minami-ku, Hiroshima 734-8553, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University School of Medicine, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8670, Japan sashidag@kumamoto-u.ac.jp aiwama@faculty.chiba-u.jp.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160711,United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (HMGA2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*deficiency', 'HMGA2 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Janus Kinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation, Missense', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics/metabolism', '*Primary Myelofibrosis/genetics/metabolism/pathology']",PMC4986523,2016/07/13 06:00,2017/07/28 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2015/07/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['jem.20151121 [pii]', '10.1084/jem.20151121 [doi]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 2016 Jul 25;213(8):1459-77. doi: 10.1084/jem.20151121.

METHODS: We enrolled 48 children who were newly diagnosed with ALL in our department during the period of 2013.1-2014.12. The patients (follow random number table) were randomly divided into the control group (peptamen) and the treatment group (peptamen + glutamine), 24 cases in each group. The remission induction regimens were all based on VDLP (D) chemotherapy (VCR (Vincrisstine), DNR (Daunomycin), L-ASP (L-Asparagiase), Prednisolone and Dexamethasone). The treatment group received Gln-enriched nutritional therapy every day during the full course of chemotherapy,and the control group is as same as the treatment group except without glutamine. The indicators of general nutritional status, such as weight, height, and triceps skinfold thickness, and the indicators of biochemical tests, such as serum albumin, prealbumin, creatinine-height index, retinol binding protein, and urinary hydroxyproline index, were compared between the two groups at the end of the first, second, third and the fourth week when the chemotherapy was completed. And in the fourth week, flow cytometry was applied to detect the levels of T cell subsets and the activities of natural killer (NK) cells in peripheral blood of the two groups. RESULTS: 1. after 4 weeks nutritional therapy, there is no significant difference (p > 0.05) between the two groups of children in weight, height and other indicators. 2. At the end of 2 weeks treatment, the level of prealbumin (PA) and retinol-binding protein (RBP) is higher in treatment group than that in the control group (P <0.05), at the end of 3 weeks treatment, the thickness of triceps skinfold is higher (P <0.05) than that in the control group; 3. At the end of 3 and 4 weeks, the concentrations serum ALB, PA, RBP and UHI were higher than in the control group (P <0.05); 4.

It also plays an important role in the regulation of cellular commitment of hematopoietic progenitor cells and myeloid cell differentiation. p15 can be silenced by several mechanisms, including deletion and hypermethylation of its promoter. Homozygous p15 deletion is rare in acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but frequent in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). On the contrary, methylation of the p15 promoter is identified in some 50% of the patients with AML and MDS, but is less frequent in ALL. The analysis of the 28 studies available in the literature revealed conflicting results (unfavorable, favorable or no impact) that can be due, at least in part, to methodological and/or biological pitfalls. Among those, are the heterogeneity of the methylation patterns of the p15 gene and the lack of a comprehensive analysis including transcriptional and translational inactivation that have major impact on its expression. Therefore, detection of the p15 mRNA expression (quantitative or not) may represent a more appropriate method to determine the prognostic impact of the p15 gene.",,"['De Braekeleer, Marc', 'Douet-Guilbert, Nathalie', 'De Braekeleer, Etienne']","['De Braekeleer M', 'Douet-Guilbert N', 'De Braekeleer E']",,"[""a Laboratoire d'Histologie, Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Faculte de Medecine et des Sciences de la Sante , Universite de Brest , Brest , France."", 'b Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) , Brest , France.', 'c Service de Cytogenetique et Biologie de la Reproduction , Hopital Morvan , CHRU Brest , Brest , France.', ""a Laboratoire d'Histologie, Embryologie et Cytogenetique, Faculte de Medecine et des Sciences de la Sante , Universite de Brest , Brest , France."", 'b Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) , Brest , France.', 'c Service de Cytogenetique et Biologie de la Reproduction , Hopital Morvan , CHRU Brest , Brest , France.', 'd Haematological Cancer Genetics , Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute , Cambridge , UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160712,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)'],IM,"['Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",,2016/07/13 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2016.1201574 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2017 Feb;58(2):257-265. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2016.1201574.

Here, we demonstrate a novel SD strategy whereby alloreacting T cells are efficiently deleted ex vivo with adenosine. SD was achieved in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) mismatched cocultures by multiple exposures to 2 mmol/l adenosine over 7 days. Adenosine depleted greater than to 90% of alloproliferating T cells in mismatched, haploidentical, and matched sibling pairs while conserving response to third-party antigens. Alloreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells were targeted for depletion while NK and B cells were preserved. Our novel approach also preserved nonalloreactive naive, central, and effector memory T-cell subsets, Tregs, and notably preserved T-cell responses against DNA viruses that contribute to transplant related mortality after allogeneic hematopoeitic stem cell transplants. Additionally, T cells recognizing leukemia-associated antigens were efficiently generated in vitro from the cell product post-SD. This study is the first to demonstrate that adenosine depletion of alloactivated T cells maintains a complete immune cell profile and recall viral responses. Expansion of tumor antigen-specific subsets postdepletion opens the possibility of generating T-cell products capable of graft-versus-tumor responses without causing GVHD.",,"['Whitehill, Greg D', 'Amarnath, Shoba', 'Muranski, Pawel', 'Keyvanfar, Keyvan', 'Battiwalla, Minoo', 'Barrett, Austin J', 'Chinnassamy, Dhanalakshmi']","['Whitehill GD', 'Amarnath S', 'Muranski P', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Battiwalla M', 'Barrett AJ', 'Chinnassamy D']",,"['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Institute of Cellular Medicine, Newcastle University, Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK.', 'Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Transplantation Immunotherapy, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20160706,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', '*Immunity', 'Leukemia/complications/*immunology/therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tissue Donors', 'Viruses/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5113112,2016/07/13 06:00,2017/06/07 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S1525-0016(16)45341-4 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2016.147 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2016 Sep;24(9):1655-64. doi: 10.1038/mt.2016.147.

T cells secreting bispecific engager molecules (ENG-T cells) may present a promising alternative to these approaches. To evaluate therapeutic potential, we generated T cells to secrete CD123/CD3-bispecific engager molecules. CD123-ENG T cells recognized primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and cell lines in an antigen-dependent manner as judged by cytokine production and/or tumor killing, and redirected bystander T cells to AML cells. Infusion of CD123-ENG T cells resulted in regression of AML in xenograft models conferring a significant survival advantage of treated mice in comparison to mice that received control T cells. At high effector to target ratios, CD123-ENG T cells recognized normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with preferential recognition of HSPCs from cord blood compared to bone marrow. We therefore introduced the CD20 suicide gene that can be targeted in vivo with rituximab into CD123-ENG T cells. The expression of CD20 did not diminish the anti-AML activity of CD123-ENG T cells, but allowed for rituximab-mediated ENG-T cell elimination. Thus, ENG-T cells coexpressing CD20 suicide and CD123 engager molecules may present a promising immunotherapeutic approach for AML.",,"['Bonifant, Challice L', 'Szoor, Arpad', 'Torres, David',

We herein report the final analysis on the complete series of patients enrolled onto this trial. Patients and Methods The APL0406 study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, phase III noninferiority trial. Eligible patients were adults between 18 and 71 years of age with newly diagnosed, low- or intermediate-risk APL (WBC at diagnosis </= 10 x 10(9)/L). Overall, 276 patients were randomly assigned to receive ATRA-ATO or ATRA-CHT between October 2007 and January 2013. Results Of 263 patients evaluable for response to induction, 127 (100%) of 127 patients and 132 (97%) of 136 patients achieved complete remission (CR) in the ATRA-ATO and ATRA-CHT arms, respectively ( P = .12). After a median follow-up of 40.6 months, the event-free survival, cumulative incidence of relapse, and overall survival at 50 months for patients in the ATRA-ATO versus ATRA-CHT arms were 97.3% v 80%, 1.9% v 13.9%, and 99.2% v 92.6%, respectively ( P < .001, P = .0013, and P = .0073, respectively). Postinduction events included two relapses and one death in CR in the ATRA-ATO arm and two instances of molecular resistance after third consolidation, 15 relapses, and five deaths in CR in the ATRA-CHT arm. Two patients in the ATRA-CHT arm developed a therapy-related myeloid neoplasm. Conclusion These results show that the advantages of ATRA-ATO over ATRA-CHT increase over time and that there is significantly greater and more sustained antileukemic efficacy of ATO-ATRA compared with ATRA-CHT in low- and intermediate-risk APL.",,"['Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Avvisati, Giuseppe', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Paoloni, Francesca', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Ferrara, Felicetto', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Efficace, Fabio', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Sborgia, Marco', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'La Nasa, Giorgio', 'Fiedler, Walter', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Hertenstein, Bernd', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Wattad, Mohammed', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Brandts, Christian H', 'Hanel, Mathias', 'Rollig, Christoph', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Link, Hartmut', 'Frairia, Chiara', 'Pogliani, Enrico Maria', 'Fozza, Claudio', ""D'Arco, Alfonso Maria"", 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Platzbecker U', 'Avvisati G', 'Cicconi L', 'Thiede C', 'Paoloni F', 'Vignetti M', 'Ferrara F', 'Divona M', 'Albano F', 'Efficace F', 'Fazi P', 'Sborgia M', 'Di Bona E', 'Breccia M', 'Borlenghi E', 'Cairoli R', 'Rambaldi A', 'Melillo L', 'La Nasa G', 'Fiedler W', 'Brossart P', 'Hertenstein B', 'Salih HR', 'Wattad M', 'Lubbert M', 'Brandts CH', 'Hanel M', 'Rollig C', 'Schmitz N', 'Link H', 'Frairia C', 'Pogliani EM', 'Fozza C', ""D'Arco AM"", 'Di Renzo N', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Fabbiano F', 'Dohner K', 'Ganser A', 'Dohner H', 'Amadori S', 'Mandelli F', 'Ehninger G', 'Schlenk RF', 'Lo-Coco F']",,"['Uwe Platzbecker, Christian Thiede, Christoph Rollig, and Gerhard Ehninger, Universitatsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus der Technischen Universitat Dresden; Uwe Platzbecker and Gerhard Ehninger, Study Alliance Leukemia, Dresden; Walter Fiedler, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf; Norbert Schmitz, Asklepios Klinik St Georg Hamburg, Hamburg; Peter Brossart, Innere Medizin mit deSchwerpunkten Onkologie, Haematollogie un Rheumatologie, Bonn; Bernd Hertenstein, Klinikum Bremen Mitte, Bremen; Helmut R.

To address this issue, we retrospectively evaluated a cohort of 460 AML patients of all ages with the exclusion of acute promyelocytic leukemia (M/F 243/217, median age 50.6 years [range 0.9-81.2]) intensively treated at our institute between January 1999 and December 2010. CD15 positivity was found in 171 of 406 evaluable patients (42.1%). Complete remission (CR) was achieved by 334 patients (72.6%), while 82 (17.8%) were resistant and 44 (9.6%) died during induction: the median CR duration was 15.5 months (range 0.6-176.0), with 2-year disease-free survival rate of 45.1% (95% confidence interval 39.6-50.6). The median overall survival was 14.4 months (range 0.3-177.0), with 2-year overall survival rate of 42.2% (95% confidence interval 37.5-46.9). At univariate analysis for CR achievement, age < 60 years (P < .001), World Health Organization classification (P = .045), low-risk karyotype (P < .001), no high-risk karyotype (P = .006), positivity for AML-ETO (P = .004)/CBFbeta-MYH11 (P = .003)/CD15 (P = .006)/CD11b (P = .013), negativity for FLT3-ITD (P = .001), Hb > 8 g/dL (P = .020), and white blood cell < 50 x 10(9) /L (P = .034) had a favorable impact. At a multivariate logistic regression model, CD15 positivity (P = .002), age < 60 years (P = .008), white blood cell < 50 x 10(9) /L (P = .017), and low-risk/no high-risk karyotype (P = .026/P = .025) retained an independent prognostic role on CR achievement. The baseline assessment of CD15 positivity appears to have a role in the risk evaluation for CR achievement in AML patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy and should be assessed in prospective studies together with other clinical and biologic features already reported.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Chisini, Marta', 'Stefanizzi, Caterina', 'Ceglie, Teresa', 'Raponi, Sara', 'Vozella, Federico', 'Colafigli, Gioia', 'Salaroli, Adriano', ""D'Angio, Mariella"", 'Mancini, Marco', 'Diverio, Daniela', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'Minotti, Clara', 'Trisolini, Silvia', 'Capria, Saveria', 'Testi, Anna Maria', 'Guarini, Anna', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Foa, Robin']","['Chisini M', 'Stefanizzi C', 'Ceglie T', 'Raponi S', 'Vozella F', 'Colafigli G', 'Salaroli A', ""D'Angio M"", 'Mancini M', 'Diverio D', 'Breccia M', 'Mancini F', 'Minotti C', 'Trisolini S', 'Capria S', 'Testi AM', 'Guarini A', 'Latagliata R', 'De Propris MS', 'Foa R']",,"['Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160712,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,['0 (Lewis X Antigen)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Lewis X Antigen/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,2016/07/13 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2016/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2331 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):804-809. doi: 10.1002/hon.2331.

AD is a heterogeneous and multifactorial disorder, histopathologically characterized by the presence of amyloid beta (Abeta) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of Abeta peptides and abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau protein, respectively. Independent of the various etiopathogenic mechanisms, neurodegeneration is a final common outcome of AD neuropathology. Synaptic loss is a better correlate of cognitive impairment in AD than Abeta or tau pathologies. Thus a highly promising therapeutic strategy for AD is to shift the balance from neurodegeneration to neuroregeneration and synaptic repair. Neurotrophic factors, by virtue of their neurogenic and neurotrophic activities, have potential for the treatment of AD. However, the clinical therapeutic usage of recombinant neurotrophic factors is limited because of the insurmountable hurdles of unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and severe adverse effects. Neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetics, in this context, represent a potential strategy to overcome these short comings, and have shown promise in preclinical studies. Neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetics have been the focus of intense research in recent years for AD drug development. Here, we review the relevant literature regarding the therapeutic beneficial effect of neurotrophic factors in AD, and then discuss the recent status of research regarding the neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetics as therapeutic candidates for AD. Lastly, we summarize the preclinical studies with a ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) small-molecule peptide mimetic, Peptide 021 (P021). P021 is a neurogenic and neurotrophic compound which enhances dentate gyrus neurogenesis and memory processes via inhibiting leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) signaling pathway and increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. It robustly inhibits tau abnormal hyperphosphorylation via increased BDNF mediated decrease in glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta, major tau kinase) activity. P021 is a small molecular weight, BBB permeable compound with suitable pharmacokinetics for oral administration, and without adverse effects associated with native CNTF or BDNF molecule. P021 has shown beneficial therapeutic effect in several preclinical studies and has emerged as a highly promising compound for AD drug development.",,"['Kazim, Syed Faraz', 'Iqbal, Khalid']","['Kazim SF', 'Iqbal K']",,"['Department of Neurochemistry, and SUNY Downstate/NYSIBR Program in Developmental Neuroscience, New York State Institute for Basic Research (NYSIBR), 1050 Forest Hill Road, Staten Island, NY, 10314, USA.', 'Graduate Program in Neural and Behavioral Science, and Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center, 450 Clarkson Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 11203, USA.', 'Department of Neurochemistry, and SUNY Downstate/NYSIBR Program in Developmental Neuroscience, New York State Institute for Basic Research (NYSIBR), 1050 Forest Hill Road, Staten Island, NY, 10314, USA. khalid.iqbal.ibr@gmail.com.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160711,England,Mol Neurodegener,Molecular neurodegeneration,101266600,['0 (Amyloid beta-Peptides)'],IM,"['Alzheimer Disease/*metabolism', 'Amyloid beta-Peptides/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Brain/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles/*metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/*physiology', 'Neurons/*metabolism']",PMC4940708,2016/07/13 06:00,2017/11/10 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2016/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/11/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13024-016-0119-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13024-016-0119-y [pii]']",epublish,Mol Neurodegener. 2016 Jul 11;11(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s13024-016-0119-y.,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Alzheimer's disease"", '*Amyloid beta', '*Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)', '*Ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF)', '*Cognition', '*Neurodegeneration', '*Neurogenesis', '*Neurotrophic factor small-molecule mimetics', '*Synaptic loss', '*Tau']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Richter syndrome can be localized at extranodal sites including the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin. Cutaneous RS is an extremely rare disease apparently showing a less aggressive course than common presentations. While nodal RS has been extensively investigated in literature, pathogenesis and prognosis of cutaneous RS are still partially unknown, even if a role of Epstein-Barr virus infection and p53 disruption has been suggested. Herein, we characterized the histopathological, immunohistochemical features and cytogenetics and molecular alterations of a case of cutaneous RS developed after 8 years chronic lymphocytic leukemia history. Moreover, we reviewed the literature reports concerning cutaneous RS and made a focus on biological patterns and prognostic implications.","['Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Reda, Gianluigi', 'Cassin, Ramona', 'Fabris, Sonia', 'Ciceri, Gabriella', 'Fattizzo, Bruno', 'Sciume, Mariarita', 'Orofino, Nicola', 'Gianelli, Umberto', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino']","['Reda G', 'Cassin R', 'Fabris S', 'Ciceri G', 'Fattizzo B', 'Sciume M', 'Orofino N', 'Gianelli U', 'Neri A', 'Cortelezzi A']",,"[""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", ""Hematopathology Service, Division of Pathology, Department of Pathophysiology and Transplantation, IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, University of Milan, Milan, Italy."", ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.', ""OncoHematology Unit, Fondazione Ca' Granda IRCCS, Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160712,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Rare Diseases', 'Skin Neoplasms/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Syndrome']",,2016/07/13 06:00,2018/01/06 06:00,['2016/07/13 06:00'],"['2016/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/06 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2327 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2017 Dec;35(4):869-874. doi: 10.1002/hon.2327.

This microenvironment facilitates crucial interactions between the cancer cells and stromal cell types that permit the tumour to survive and proliferate. There is increasing evidence that the bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMMSC) is stably altered in patients with MM-a phenotype also postulated to exist in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) a benign condition that precedes MM. In this study, we describe a mechanism by which increased expression of peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2) by BMMSCs in patients with MGUS and MM directly alters malignant plasma cell phenotype. We identify PADI2 as one of the most highly upregulated transcripts in BMMSCs from both MGUS and MM patients, and that through its enzymatic deimination of histone H3 arginine 26, PADI2 activity directly induces the upregulation of interleukin-6 expression. This leads to the acquisition of resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent, bortezomib, by malignant plasma cells. We therefore describe a novel mechanism by which BMMSC dysfunction in patients with MGUS and MM directly leads to pro-malignancy signalling through the citrullination of histone H3R26.",,"['McNee, G', 'Eales, K L', 'Wei, W', 'Williams, D S', 'Barkhuizen, A', 'Bartlett, D B', 'Essex, S', 'Anandram, S', 'Filer, A', 'Moss, P A H', 'Pratt, G', 'Basu, S', 'Davies, C C', 'Tennant, D A']","['McNee G', 'Eales KL', 'Wei W', 'Williams DS', 'Barkhuizen A', 'Bartlett DB', 'Essex S', 'Anandram S', 'Filer A', 'Moss PA', 'Pratt G', 'Basu S', 'Davies CC', 'Tennant DA']",,"['Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Wolverhampton, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Wolverhampton, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, Wolverhampton, UK.', 'Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, College of Medical and Dental Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['C1520/A9992/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/K501323/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['Journal Article'],20160711,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptome']",PMC5292682,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/09/02 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016187 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.187 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Feb;31(2):373-381. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.187.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of the records of women with hematologic malignancies treated at our institution from January 2002 through January 2016. Women with AUB as the chief presenting symptom were identified. RESULTS: Of the 10,682 women with hematologic malignancies, 38 had AUB as their chief presenting symptom. These women were young (median age 34 years), premenopausal, and otherwise healthy. The top four additional presenting symptoms were fatigue, dyspnea or shortness of breath, bruising or petechiae, and fever, with means (95% confidence interval) of 58% (41-74%), 42% (26-59%), 42% (26-59%), and 24% (11-40%), respectively. The complete blood count on initial presentation with AUB revealed that 33 (87%) women had anemia (mean hemoglobin level 8.6 g/dL) and 34 (89%) had thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count 81,000/microliter). Twelve (32%) women had neutropenia, eight (21%) women had normal white blood cell counts, and 18 (47%) women had leukocytosis. Thirty-three women (87%) were diagnosed with acute leukemia, one with myelodysplastic syndrome (3%) and four (11%) with chronic leukemia. CONCLUSION: We estimate the incidence of AUB as the chief presenting symptom is 3.6 cases per 1,000 women with hematologic cancer. These young, otherwise healthy women who present with acute, new-onset heavy menstrual bleeding in conjunction with thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia should be referred to hematology for evaluation of possible hematologic malignancy.",,"['Nebgen, Denise R', 'Rhodes, Helen E', 'Hartman, Cynthia', 'Munsell, Mark F', 'Lu, Karen H']","['Nebgen DR', 'Rhodes HE', 'Hartman C', 'Munsell MF', 'Lu KH']",,"['Departments of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine and Biostatistics, the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Obstet Gynecol,Obstetrics and gynecology,0401101,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia/etiology', 'Dyspnea/etiology', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*complications/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Leukocytosis/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Neutropenia/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/complications/diagnosis', 'Purpura/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', 'Uterine Hemorrhage/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC4961605,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/06/09 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/AOG.0000000000001529 [doi]', '00006250-201608000-00020 [pii]']",ppublish,Obstet Gynecol. 2016 Aug;128(2):357-363. doi: 10.1097/AOG.0000000000001529.,,,['NIHMS789221'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coffee consumption, however, has also been linked to an increased risk of developing some types of cancer, including bladder cancer in adults and leukemia in children of mothers who drink coffee during pregnancy. Since cancer is driven by the accumulation of DNA alterations, the ability of the coffee constituent caffeic acid to induce DNA damage in cells may play a role in the carcinogenic potential of this beverage. This carcinogenic potential may be exacerbated in cells with DNA repair defects. People with the genetic disease Fanconi Anemia have DNA repair deficiencies and are predisposed to several cancers, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. Defects in the DNA repair protein Fanconi Anemia D2 (FANCD2) also play an important role in the development of a variety of cancers (e.g., bladder cancer) in people without this genetic disease. This communication shows that cells deficient in FANCD2 are hypersensitive to the cytotoxicity (clonogenic assay) and DNA damage (gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 focus assay) induced by caffeic acid and by a commercial lyophilized coffee extract.

MDS is associated with increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and features of immunological dysregulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum levels of 47 soluble immune mediators were examined in samples derived from 49 MDS patients (35 low-risk and 14 high-risk) and 23 healthy adults. Our patients represent an unselected population-based cohort. The mediators included cytokines, soluble adhesion proteins, matrix metalloproteases, and tissue inhibitors of proteases. Levels were determined using Luminex assays. Patients were classified as low- and high-risk based on the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) score. RESULTS: When comparing the serum levels of single mediators the MDS patients showed a relatively wide variation range for several mediators compared with healthy adults, especially interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8/CXCL8, CCL3, and CCL4. The high-risk patients had lower levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF), cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (CD40L), CCL5, CCL11, CXCL5, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-9, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP-2) compared with low-risk patients. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis visualized marked serum mediator profile differences between MDS patients; based on this analysis three patient subsets could be identified. The healthy adults were also included in this analysis and, as expected, they formed their own separate cluster, except for one outlier. Both low- and high-risk patients showed considerable heterogeneity with regard to serum profile, and this heterogeneity seems stable over time (one year follow-up). Finally, very few mediators differed between low- and high-risk patients, but hierarchical clustering based both on all mediators, as well as five selected mediators (EGF, CCL11, TIMP-2, MMP-1, and MMP-9) identified subsets of patients with significantly increased frequency of high-risk disease (chi-square test p = 0.0158 and p = 0.0148).",,"['Kittang, Astrid Olsnes', 'Sand, Kristoffer', 'Brenner, Annette Katharina', 'Rye, Kristin Paulsen', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Kittang AO', 'Sand K', 'Brenner AK', 'Rye KP', 'Bruserud O']",,"['Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen N-5021, Norway. astrid.kittang@uib.no.', 'Division for Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen N-5021, Norway. astrid.kittang@uib.no.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen N-5021, Norway. kristoffer.sand@uib.no.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen N-5021, Norway. annette.brenner@uib.no.', 'Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen N-5021, Norway.

Using four human AML cell lines representing different stages of myeloid maturation (KG-1a, HL60, U937, and MOLM-13), we found that the potency of PRI-1916 was slightly higher or equal to that of PRI-1906 while PRI-1917 was significantly less potent than PRI-1907. We also demonstrated that 1,25D2 was a less effective differentiation agent than 1,25D3 in these cell lines. Irrespective of their differentiation potency, all the vitamin D(2) derivatives tested were less potent than 1,25D3 in transactivating the DR3-type vitamin D response elements. However, similar to 1,25D3, both 1,25D2 and its analogs could strongly cooperate with the plant polyphenol carnosic acid in inducing cell differentiation and inhibition of G1-S cell cycle transition. These results indicate that the 24Z modification has contrasting effects on the differentiation ability of PRI-1906 and PRI-1907 and that the addition of a plant polyphenol could result in a similar extent of cell differentiation induced by different vitamin D compounds. The enhanced antileukemic effects of the tested combinations may constitute the basis for the development of novel approaches for differentiation therapy of AML.",,"['Nachliely, Matan', 'Sharony, Ehud', 'Bolla, Narasimha Rao', 'Kutner, Andrzej', 'Danilenko, Michael']","['Nachliely M', 'Sharony E', 'Bolla NR', 'Kutner A', 'Danilenko M']",,"['Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 841051, Israel. matanna@post.bgu.ac.il.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 841051, Israel. ehudshar@gmail.com.', 'Department of Chemistry and Department of Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Warsaw 01-793, Poland. n.bolla@ifarm.eu.', 'Department of Chemistry and Department of Pharmacology, Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Warsaw 01-793, Poland. a.kutner@ifarm.eu.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 841051, Israel. misha@bgu.ac.il.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160705,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (24a-homo-1,15-dihydroxyergocalciferol)', '0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '0 (PRI-1916)', '0 (PRI-1917)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",IM,"['Abietanes/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ergocalciferols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyphenols/*pharmacology']",PMC4964444,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17071068 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17071068 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Jul 5;17(7). pii: ijms17071068. doi: 10.3390/ijms17071068.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'analogs of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2', 'carnosic acid', 'cell cycle distribution', 'cell differentiation', 'retinoid X receptor', 'vitamin D receptor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to describe infections and identify risk factors of microbiologically documented infections at a sterile site in children with DS during chemotherapy for ALL. PROCEDURE: We conducted a single-institution retrospective review of infectious episodes encountered by patients with DS during primary treatment for ALL. Correlations between features of clinical presentation and severity of microbiologically proven infections were investigated. RESULTS: Among 237 suspected infectious episodes encountered by 35 patients with DS and ALL (DS-ALL), a total of 40 episodes (16.9%) had the clinical presentation of a severe infection (SI). Seventeen patients had 33 (13.9%) microbiologically proven infections from a sterile site. Fever was not part of the clinical presentation in 27% of microbiologically documented infectious episodes. The odds ratio of a microbiologically proven infection at a sterile site was significantly increased during a 7-day interval after treatment with glucocorticoids (2.18; 95% CI: 1.02-4.66; P = 0.04). Neither administration of anthracyclines in the preceding 14 days nor neutropenia correlated with infections. CONCLUSIONS: Serious infections in DS-ALL may present without typical signs such as fever.

However, the mechanisms of differential responses and resistance of CRCs to targeted therapies are not well understood. In this study, we found that genetic alterations of FBW7, an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a tumor suppressor frequently mutated in CRCs, contribute to resistance to targeted therapies. CRC cells containing FBW7-inactivating mutations are insensitive to clinically used multi-kinase inhibitors of RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK signaling, including regorafenib and sorafenib. In contrast, sensitivity to these agents is not affected by oncogenic mutations in KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA or p53. These cells are defective in apoptosis owing to blocked degradation of Mcl-1, a pro-survival Bcl-2 family protein. Deleting FBW7 in FBW7-wild-type CRC cells abolishes Mcl-1 degradation and recapitulates the in vitro and in vivo drug-resistance phenotypes of FBW7-mutant cells. CRC cells selected for regorafenib resistance have progressive enrichment of pre-existing FBW7 hotspot mutations, and are cross-resistant to other targeted drugs that induce Mcl-1 degradation. Furthermore, a selective Mcl-1 inhibitor restores regorafenib sensitivity in CRC cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance. Together, our results demonstrate FBW7 mutational status as a key genetic determinant of CRC response to targeted therapies, and Mcl-1 as an attractive therapeutic target.",,"['Tong, J', 'Tan, S', 'Zou, F', 'Yu, J', 'Zhang, L']","['Tong J', 'Tan S', 'Zou F', 'Yu J', 'Zhang L']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1640-5769'],"['Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'College of Life Sciences, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA203028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI068021/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA047904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA172136/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 DK085570/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106348/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160711,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pyridines)', '24T2A1DOYB (regorafenib)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Female', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Sorafenib', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC5226932,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/09/26 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['onc2016247 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2016.247 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2017 Feb 9;36(6):787-796. doi: 10.1038/onc.2016.247.

However, the mechanism of MTX-related leukoencephalopathy is obscure. MTX and its metabolites inhibit 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide formiltransferase (ATIC) and promote adenosine release. Recently, it has been reported that adenosine and its receptor are related to certain central nervous system diseases. We investigated whether adenosine pathway gene polymorphisms and clinical factors were related to MTX-related leukoencephalopathy in pediatric patients affected by hematological malignancies. PROCEDURE: Fifty-six Japanese childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoma patients were investigated. Patients were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging of the brain before maintenance therapy or stem cell transplantation. Gene polymorphisms within the adenosine pathway (ATIC, adenosine A2A receptor [ADORA2A]) and the MTX pathway (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] and ABCB1) were genotyped using TaqMan assays. Clinical data were collected by accessing the medical records. MTX-related leukoencephalopathy was evaluated by a pediatric neurologist. RESULTS: Twenty-one (37%) of 56 patients developed MTX-related leukoencephalopathy. Four of 21 patients developed clinical neurotoxicity. The minor allele CC genotype of rs2298383 (ADORA2A) was associated with MTX-related leukoencephalopathy (P = 0.010, odds ratio = 5.81, 95% confidence interval 1.50-22.50). High cumulative dose of systemic MTX was associated with MTX-related leukoencephalopathy after adjusting for sex, ADORA2A polymorphism, and prolonged high MTX concentration (P = 0.042, odds ratio = 1.18, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.37). CONCLUSIONS: ADORA2A rs2298383 and high cumulative dose of systemic MTX administration were significantly associated with MTX-related leukoencephalopathy. Our results indicate that pharmacological intervention within the adenosine pathway may be both a treatment and preventative option for MTX-related leukoencephalopathy.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Tsujimoto, Shin-Ichi', 'Yanagimachi, Masakatsu', 'Tanoshima, Reo', 'Urayama, Kevin Y', 'Tanaka, Fumiko', 'Aida, Noriko', 'Goto, Hiroaki', 'Ito, Shuichi']","['Tsujimoto S', 'Yanagimachi M', 'Tanoshima R', 'Urayama KY', 'Tanaka F', 'Aida N', 'Goto H', 'Ito S']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama City, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama City, Japan. myanagi@yokohama-cu.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama City, Japan.', ""Center for Clinical Epidemiology, St. Luke's International University, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Saiseikai Yokohama-Shi Nanbu Hospital, Kounan-ku, Yokohama City, Japan.', ""Department of Radiology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Minami-ku, Yokohama City, Japan."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Kanagawa Children's Medical Center, Minami-ku, Yokohama City, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Kanazawa-ku, Yokohama City, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160711,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A2A)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukoencephalopathies/*chemically induced/genetics', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Receptor, Adenosine A2A/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26090 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1983-9. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26090.

The expression of Bcl-xL(S49A), (S62A) and dual (S49/62A) phosphorylation mutants in tumor cells lead to severe mitotic defects associated with multipolar spindle, chromosome lagging and bridging, and micro-, bi- and multi-nucleated cells. Because the above observations were made in tumor cells which already display genomic instability, we now address the question: will similar effects occur in normal human diploid cells? We studied normal human diploid BJ foreskin fibroblast cells expressing Bcl-xL (wild type), (S49A), (S49D), (S62A), (S62D) and the dual-site (S49/62A) and (S49/62D) mutants. Cells expressing S49 and/or S62 phosphorylation mutants showed reduced kinetics of cell population doubling. These effects on cell population doubling kinetics correlated with early outbreak of senescence with no impact on the cell death rate. Senescent cells displayed typical senescence-associated phenotypes including high-level of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion, tumor suppressor p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Waf1/Cip1 activation as well as gammaH2A.X-associated nuclear chromatin foci. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis and Giemsa-banded karyotypes revealed that the expression of Bcl-xL phosphorylation mutants in normal diploid BJ cells provoked chromosome instability and aneuploidy. These findings suggest that dynamic Bcl-xL(S49) and (S62) phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycles are important in the maintenance of chromosome integrity during mitosis in normal cells. They could impact future strategies aiming to develop and identify compounds that could target not only the anti-apoptotic domain of Bcl-xL protein, but also its mitotic domain for cancer therapy.",,"['Baruah, Prasamit Saurav', 'Beauchemin, Myriam', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Bertrand, Richard']","['Baruah PS', 'Beauchemin M', 'Hebert J', 'Bertrand R']",,"[""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Centre de recherche, Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Departement de medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche, Centre hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal (CRCHUM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada."", 'Institut du Cancer de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Departement de medecine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160711,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (bcl-X Protein)'],IM,"['*Aneuploidy', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosomal Instability', '*Diploidy', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', '*Mitosis', '*Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4939973,2016/07/12 06:00,2017/07/20 06:00,['2016/07/12 06:00'],"['2016/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0159091 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-13305 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jul 11;11(7):e0159091. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0159091. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to find a highly effective, low toxic anti-tumour drug and further investigate its mechanisms. Jurkat cells were used as the object and were stimulated by different concentrations of crocin. By cell count, growth curve, MTT method for the detection of cell proliferation, annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) method for the apoptosis rates, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for bcl-2 and bax gene expression, the effect and mechanisms of proliferative inhibition of crocin on Jurkat cells were further explored. Crocin promoted Jurkat cell apoptosis and inhibited cell growth, in a dose-time-dependent manner. The mechanism might be related to the inhibition of bcl-2 gene expression and the promotion of bax gene expression. These results suggest that crocin can be used as a suitable clinical agent for the treatment of T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.",,"['Sun, Y', 'Wang, Z', 'Wang, L', 'Wang, L-Z', 'Zang, C', 'Sun, L-R']","['Sun Y', 'Wang Z', 'Wang L', 'Wang LZ', 'Zang C', 'Sun LR']",,"['Department of Paediatric Haematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, PR China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, PR China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Yantai Yu Huang Ding Hospital Affiliated to Qingdao University, Yantai 264000, PR China.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, PR China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Wendeng Central Hospital of Weihai, Weihai 264400, PR China.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao 266003, PR China.

In cases of severe hepatic VOD/SOS, typically defined by associated multiorgan failure (MOF, also known as multiorgan dysfunction), mortality exceeds 80%. Preclinical and early clinical data have provided a rationale for defibrotide treatment in hepatic VOD/SOS. Based on this evidence and in recognition of the dismal prognosis for these patients, defibrotide was made available through an international multicenter compassionate-use program conducted from December 1998 to March 2009. Physicians participating in the program voluntarily provided demographic and outcome data for patients given defibrotide. Efficacy and safety analyses were performed using the data received for 710 treated patients. Defibrotide was given at 10, 25, 40, 60, or 80 mg/kg/day for a median of 15 days (range, 1 to 119 days). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated overall day +100 survival was 54% (58% in the 25 mg/kg/day dose group). Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 53% of patients. The most common AEs were MOF, progression of hepatic VOD/SOS, sepsis, and graft-versus-host disease, which were consistent with the AEs expected for this patient population. No clinically meaningful trends in AEs were identified by gender, age, or dose group. Safety and efficacy resultswere consistent with prior studies of defibrotide in hepatic VOD/SOS, and subgroup analyses lend support to the use of the 25 mg/kg/day dose.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Although most patients who receive TKI treatment have shown satisfactory tolerance, second malignancies (SMs) should not be ignored because of lifetime treatment. We designed a retrospective study to evaluate the incidence and possible risk factors of SMs in CML patients treated with TKIs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Records of 223 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML treated with imatinib were reviewed to investigate frequencies and characteristics of SMs. The data of SMs were compared with the number expected from the National Central Cancer Registry. The possible risk factors of SM in CML patients treated with TKIs were also evaluated using Poisson regression in this study. RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 64 months (range, 4-253 months) from CML diagnosis, 7 patients (3.14%) developed 6 different SMs including colon, stomach, breast, kidney, cervical, and lymphonodus tissue. The risk of second cancer was higher than expected (observed-to-expected ratio, 2.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.14; P = .018). No associated elements were found in terms of influencing the incidence of SM in CML patients treated with TKIs. CONCLUSION: We found patients with CML treated with TKIs had a higher relative incidence of SM compared with the expected incidence among the general Chinese population. However, the correlations between second cancer and the potential risk factors including the length of exposure and cumulative dose of TKIs were not found in this study.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we report the further development and application of a chemoenzymatic strategy to afford a series of new analogs of parthenolide functionalized at the aliphatic positions C9 and C14. Several of these compounds were determined to be able to kill leukemia cells and patient-derived primary AML specimens with improved activity compared to parthenolide, exhibiting LC50 values in the low micromolar range. These studies demonstrate that different O-H functionalization chemistries can be applied to elaborate the parthenolide scaffold and that modifications at the C9 or C14 position can effectively enhance the antileukemic properties of this natural product.

Because AzaC is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein (a product of the ABCB1 gene; ABCB1), ABCB1 was not responsible for AzaC resistance; nevertheless, it was notably upregulated in SKM-1/AzaC cells. In addition, the transcription of the Nfkb1 gene, which encodes a member of the canonical NF-kappaB regulatory pathway, was downregulated, and the transcription of the Nfkb2 gene, which encodes a member of the non-canonical NF-kappaB regulatory pathway, was upregulated in SKM-1/AzaC cells. Here, we investigate whether miRNA-27a and miRNA-138 (both of which are known to be regulators of ABCB1 expression) are involved in the regulation of ABCB1 expression in SKM-1/AzaC cells. We observed decreased levels of miRNA-27a but of not miRNA-138 in SKM-1/AzaC cells compared with SKM-1 cells. The transfection of SKM-1/AzaC cells with a miRNA-27a mimic induced the downregulation of the ABCB1 mRNA. This was associated with an increase in Nfkb1 and a decrease in Nfkb2 transcript levels in SKM-1/AzaC cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the downregulation of miRNA-27a is involved in the upregulation of ABCB1 expression in SKM-1/AzaC cells, and this effect is associated with a switch between the canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The aims of this study were to evaluate the activity of quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives on K562 cells, the establishment of the mechanism of induced cell death, and the construction of predictive QSAR models. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen esters of quinoxaline-7-carboxylate 1,4-di-N-oxide were evaluated for antitumor activity on K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and their IC50 values were determined. The mechanism of induced cell death by the most active molecule was assessed by flow cytometry and an in silico study was conducted to optimize and calculate theoretical descriptors of all quinoxaline 1,4-di-N-oxide derivatives. QSAR and QPAR models were created using genetic algorithms. RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that compounds C5, C7, C10, C12 and C15 had the lowest IC50 of the series.

It initiates before birth, and very little is known about the early stages of the disease's development. Using a conditional Mll-AF4-expressing mouse model in which fusion expression is targeted to the earliest definitive hematopoietic cells generated in the mouse embryo, we demonstrate that Mll-AF4 imparts enhanced B lymphoid potential and increases repopulation and self-renewal capacity during a putative pre-leukemic state. This occurs between embryonic days 12 and 14 and manifests itself most strongly in the lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor population, thus pointing to a window of opportunity and a potential cell of origin. However, this state alone is insufficient to generate disease, with the mice succumbing to B cell lymphomas only after a long latency.

The majority of cases are due to nonspecific causes such as musculoskeletal trauma with spontaneous regression. On some occasions, however, life-threatening diseases have to be considered. CASE REPORT: A 15-year-old girl presented to the Pediatric Emergency Department for a history of continuous 2-day duration of low back pain and transient paresthesia of the right gluteal area. Low back pain was diagnosed and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory treatment combined with rest were prescribed. After 7 days, worsening of the clinical conditions was observed with bilateral gluteus paresthesia. A corset was recommended, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and rheumatological evaluation were prescribed on an outpatient basis. After 5 days she was hospitalized due to urinary incontinence and persistence of pain. Blood tests revealed neutrophil leukocytosis associated with mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, hyperuricemia, and increased lactate dehydrogenase. MRI examination of the spine demonstrated a mass involving the sacral canal and the presacral region, extending through the sacral foramina, along the nerve roots. Similar tissue was found at multiple levels in the spine and in the right orbit. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy highlighted the presence of myeloid blasts and myeloid dysplasia, consequently, myeloid sarcoma was diagnosed.

Busulfan is involved in secondary malignancy due to its genotoxic potential in normal tissues. As an alkylating agent busulfan can cause DNA damage by cross-linking DNAs and DNA and proteins, induces senescence in normal cells via transient depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) and subsequently by a continuous increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Erythropoietin, a glycoprotein widely used against drug induced anemia in cancerous patients and regulates hematopoiesis, has been shown to exert an important cyto-protective effect in many tissues. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been demonstrated to directly limit cell injury and ROS generation during oxidative stress. Furthermore, rhEPO decreased levels of pro-apoptotic factor (Bax) and also increased expression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl2. According to EPO's short half-life and requirements for the frequently administration, finding the new strategies to attenuate its side effects is important. The aim of this study was to explore whether rhEPO loading chitosan-tripolyphosphate nanoparticles protects against busulfan-induced genotoxicity in HepG2 cells. For this purpose cells were incubated with busulfan alone, regular rhEPO alone and regular rhEPO and CS-TPP-EPO nanoparticles along with busulfan in pre and co-treatment condition. Our results showed that busulfan induced a noticeable genotoxic effects in HepG2 cells (p<0.0001). Both regular rhEPO and CS-TPP-EPO nanoparticles reduced the effects of busulfan significantly (p<0.0001) by reduction of the level of DNA damage via blocking ROS generation, and enhancement intracellular glutathione levels. CS-TPP-EPO nanoparticles were more effective than regular rhEPO in both pre and co-treatment conditions. In conclusion, our results show that administration of rhEPO and CS-TPP-EPO nanoparticles especially in the pre-treatment conditions, significantly decreased the level of DNA damage induced by busulfan, measured with the comet assay, in HepG2 cells compared to the regular rhEPO group.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

These bone marrow malignancies are traditionally diagnosed and classified by cell morphology, phenotype and cytogenetic abnormalities. Traditionally morphology is assessed by light microscopy, phenotyping by conventional flow cytometry and genetics by karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) on interphase nuclei/metaphase spreads of cells on slides. Imaging flow cytometry adds a new dimension to the diagnostic assessment of these neoplasms.

Patients with either a disease-free interval or interval between transplants of > 1 year had better overall survival (P = .02 and P = .0005) after AlloHCT2. CONCLUSION: AlloHCT2 remains a potential curative option in a subset of patients with relapsed ALL after the first AlloHCT.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

An attractive therapeutic target in treating leukemia, knockout studies of G9a in mice have found dramatically slowed proliferation and self-renewal of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells due to the attenuation of HoxA9-dependent transcription. In this study, a series of compounds were identified as potential inhibitors through structure-based virtual screening. Among these compounds, a new G9a inhibitor, DCG066, was confirmed by in vitro biochemical, and cell based enzyme assays. DCG066 has a novel molecular scaffold unlike other G9a inhibitors presently available. Similar to G9a's histone substrate, DCG066 can bind directly to G9a and inhibit methyltransferase activity in vitro. In addition to suppressing G9a methyltransferase activity and reducing histone H3 methylation levels, DCG066 displays low cytotoxicity in leukemia cell lines with high levels of G9a expression, including K562. This work presents DCG066 as an inhibitor of G9a with a novel structure, providing both a lead in G9a inhibitor design and a means for probing the functionality of G9a.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Although abnormal syncytin-1 expression has been detected in two-thirds of leukemia blood samples, its expression profile in acute leukemia patients has not yet been analyzed. MATERIAL AND METHODS Bone marrow samples from 50 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cases and 14 B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (B-cell ALL) patients were subjected to flow cytometry to assess leukocyte type distributions and leukocytic syncytin-1 surface expression. RT-PCR was applied to assess leukocytic syncytin-1 mRNA expression. Statistical analysis was applied to compare syncytin-1 expression between AML and B-cell ALL patients across blasts, granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes as well as to determine clinical factors statistically associated with changes in syncytin-1 expression. RESULTS The leukocyte type distributions of the AML and B-cell ALL cohorts highly overlapped, with an observable difference in blast distribution between the 2 cohorts. The AML cohort displayed significantly greater syncytin-1 surface and mRNA expression (p<0.05). Syncytin-1 surface and mRNA expression was significantly increased across all 4 leukocyte types (p<0.05). The percentage of syncytin-1-expressing blasts was significantly greater in AML patients (p<0.05), with blasts showing the largest fold-change in syncytin-1 expression (p<0.05). M5, M5a, and M5b AML patients displayed significantly higher syncytin-1 surface expression relative to all other AML French-American-British (FAB) classifications (p<0.05).

However, the absence of response among patients and the metabolic profile of imatinib (involving the CYP3A4) suggested the existence of a great interindividual variability. During the last 4 years, studies about the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship have confirmed this variability and highlighted a relation between the trough concentrations of imatinib and the clinical response. An effectiveness threshold, close to 1000 ng/mL, seems to be correlated with better cytogenetic and molecular responses. Consequently, TDM could assist in investigation of the observance, the absence of response, the drug-drug interactions, but the proof of its utility requires complementary studies. In conclusion, the level of proof of imatinib TDM in LMC varies between levels ""recommended"" and ""potentially useful"".","['Copyright (c) 2010 Societe Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.

This enzyme displays important inter subject variability linked to a genetic polymorphism: when treated with standard doses of thiopurine, TPMT-deficient and heterozygous patients are at great risk for developing severe and potentially life-threatening toxicity (hematopoietic, hepatic, mucositis. . . ) but show a better survival rate while patients with high TPMT activity (wild type) present lower peripheral red blood cells 6-TGN concentrations and a higher risk of leukemia relapse. Genotyping remains crucial before 6-MP administration at diagnosis to identify patients with homozygous mutant TPMT genotype and therefore prevent severe and life-threatening toxicity, and to individualize therapy according to TMPT genotype.

Their anti-nucleotidic properties are also used for the treatment of acute leukaemia. Their metabolism involves thiopurine methyl transferase, which activity varies according to genetic polymorphisms. In inflammatory bowel disease patients, there is no recommended therapeutic range of intra-erythrocyte 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentration, the active metabolite. Therapeutic drug monitoring of 6-thioguanine nucleotide concentrations is however proposed in the following clinical situations: to check the observance, to try to explain therapeutic failure, to manage patients with limited thiopurine methyl transferase activity or patients treated with associated drugs that can modify thiopurine methyl transferase activity. The literature review shows that high concentrations of 6-thioguanine nucleotides and methylated metabolites are associated with an increased risk of bone marrow toxicity. In addition, high concentrations of methylated metabolite might increase the risk of hepatic toxicity. These major side-effects can be prevented by the use of pre-treatment screening for thiopurine methyl transferase activity or genotype in inflammatory bowel disease patients in order to propose an adapted dosing.","['Copyright (c) 2010 Societe Francaise de Pharmacologie et de Therapeutique.

Cells that occupy primed pluripotency have distinct epigenetic landscapes, transcriptional circuitry, and trophic requirements compared with their naive counterparts. The existence of multiple pluripotent states has not been explored in dogs, which show promise as outbred biomedical models with more than 300 inherited diseases that also afflict humans. However, our understanding of canine embryogenesis and embryo-derived stem cells is limited. Herein, we converted leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)-dependent canine embryonic stem cells (cESCs) resembling primed PSCs toward a naive pluripotent state using LIF and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 [called 2i and LIF (2iL)]. cESCs propagated in 2iL exhibited significant induction of genes associated with the naive pluripotent state (eg, REX1, TBX3) and downregulation of primed pluripotency markers (eg, OTX2, FGF5) (P < 0.05). Differential phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and cell fate decisions on exposure to bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) suggested that a novel pluripotent identity has been established with 2iL. Accordingly, cESCs cultured with 2iL formed colonies at a greater efficiency than LIF-FGF2 cESCs following single-cell dissociation. Total genomic DNA methylation and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation signals were reduced in 2iL-treated cESCs. Our data suggest that 2iL culture conditions promote the conversion of cESCs toward an epigenetically distinct pluripotent state resembling naive PSCs.",,"['Tobias, Ian C', 'Brooks, Courtney R', 'Teichroeb, Jonathan H', 'Villagomez, Daniel A', 'Hess, David A', 'Seguin, Cheryle A', 'Betts, Dean H']","['Tobias IC', 'Brooks CR', 'Teichroeb JH', 'Villagomez DA', 'Hess DA', 'Seguin CA', 'Betts DH']",,"['1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', '1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', '1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', '2 Department of Biomedical Sciences, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph , Guelph, Ontario, Canada .', '3 Departamento de Produccion Animal, Universidad de Guadalajara , Zapopan, Jalisco, Mexico .', '1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', ""4 Children's Health Research Institute, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada ."", '5 Molecular Medicine Research Group, Krembil Centre for Stem Cell Biology, Robarts Research Institute, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario Canada .', '1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', ""4 Children's Health Research Institute, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada ."", '1 Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .', ""4 Children's Health Research Institute, the University of Western Ontario , London, Ontario, Canada .""]",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160728,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Dogs', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects']",,2016/07/10 06:00,2017/09/12 06:00,['2016/07/10 06:00'],"['2016/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/scd.2016.0103 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2016 Aug 15;25(16):1208-22. doi: 10.1089/scd.2016.0103.

Since those early trials, therapeutic advances have produced monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins that are now used in multiple disease states including cancers, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, neurologic disorders and others. Modern techniques have led to the development of multiple chimeric or fully humanized immunoglobulin, receptor and fusion proteins targeting cell markers, interleukins or other target proteins involved in pathophysiologic disease processes resulting in marked improvements in many different disease states. As novel innovator patents are about to expire, commercial entities are actively involved in creating follow-on agents that are similar to these original biologic innovator compounds.

The desire of manufacturers is product development at lower cost (lower research and development) with great potential for widespread use and sales.

The overall incidence of this genetic category of leukemia is uncertain. PROCEDURE: Patients with ZNF384 gene rearrangements from a cohort of 240 precursor B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) pediatric patients over a 3.5-year time period were characterized with detailed cytogenetic, FISH, genomic, and clinical analyses. RESULTS: Seven of the 240 patients were identified to have ZNF384 gene rearrangements including partner genes TCF3 (four patients), EWSR1 (one patient), EP300 (one patient), and the novel gene partner ARID1B (one patient). The translocations were confirmed by FISH analysis and with RNA sequencing for the EP300 and ARID1B partner genes. Genomic microarray analysis showed an average of 2.7 copy number alterations in each case with no evidence of imbalance at the translocation breakpoints. Six of the patients with ZNF384 gene rearrangements had precursor B cell ALL with a CD10- immunophenotype and myeloid-associated antigens. One of the patients also had myeloperoxidase expression and was diagnosed as mixed phenotype B/myeloid acute leukemia. None of the patients have relapsed with event-free survival ranging from 6 years 2 months to 9 years 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the frequency of ZNF384 gene rearrangement in pediatric precursor B cell ALL is approximately 3%. The ARID1B gene, commonly mutated in multiple types of cancer, was identified as an additional ZNF384 gene fusion partner.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Shago, Mary', 'Abla, Oussama', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Weitzman, Sheila', 'Abdelhaleem, Mohamed']","['Shago M', 'Abla O', 'Hitzler J', 'Weitzman S', 'Abdelhaleem M']",,"['Department of Paediatric Laboratory Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mary.shago@sickkids.ca.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. mary.shago@sickkids.ca.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatrics, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.', 'Department of Paediatric Laboratory Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160708,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (ARID1B protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZNF384 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Fusion', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26116 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1915-21. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26116.

Groups of 50 male and 50 female Wistar Hannover rats, 6-week-old at commencement were exposed to EEP at doses of 0, 0.5 or 2.5% in the diet. Survival rates of 0.5% and 2.5% EEP-treated male and female rats, respectively, were significantly higher than those of respective control groups. Overall histopathological evaluation of neoplasms in rat tissues after 2 years showed no significant increase of tumors or preneoplastic lesions in any organ of animals administered EEP. Significantly lower incidences of pituitary tumors in 0.5% EEP male and 2.5% EEP female groups, malignant lymphoma/leukemia in both 2.5% EEP-treated males and females and total thyroid tumors in 0.5% EEP male group were found. Administration of EEP caused significant decreases of lymphoid hyperplasia of the thymus and lymph nodes in 2.5% EEP-treated rats, tubular cell hyperplasia of kidneys in all EEP groups, and cortical hyperplasia of adrenals in EEP-treated females. In the blood, significant reduction of neutrophils in all EEP-treated males and band neutrophils in 2.5% EEP-treated females was found indicating lower levels of inflammation. Total cholesterol and triglicerides levels were significantly lower in the blood of 2.5% EEP-treated female rats.

This study examined distress profiles for adult survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. METHODS: Self-reported depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms from Brief Symptom Inventory 18 were examined in survivors (n = 16,079) and siblings (n = 3085) from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. A latent profile analysis identified clusters of survivors with individual and comorbid symptoms. Disease, treatment, and demographic predictors of distress comorbidity patterns were examined with multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Four clinically relevant profiles were identified: low distress on all subscales (asymptomatic, 62%), high distress on all subscales (comorbid distress, 11%), elevated somatization (somatic symptoms, 13%), and elevated depression and anxiety (affective distress, 14%). Compared with siblings, fewer survivors were asymptomatic (62% vs 74%, P < .0001), and more had comorbid distress (11% vs 5%, P < .0001). Survivors of leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.61), central nervous system tumors (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), and sarcoma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57) had a greater risk of comorbid distress than survivors of solid tumors. Psychoactive medications were associated with comorbid distress (P < .0001), and this suggested that this group was refractory to traditional medical management. Comorbid distress was associated with poor perceived health (OR, 31.7; 95% CI, 23.1-43.3), headaches (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7), and bodily pain (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.2-5.0). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of survivors are at risk for comorbid distress, which may require extensive treatment approaches beyond those used for individual symptoms.

Univariate analysis showed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation at CR1 as the only clinical parameter associated with superior LFS. Next-generation sequencing based on a myeloid gene panel was performed in 72 patients. Mutations in genes involved in cell signaling were associated with inferior LFS and OS, whereas those in genes involved in DNA methylation were associated with inferior LFS. KIT activation loop (AL) mutations occurred in 25 patients, and were associated with inferior LFS (P=0.003) and OS (P=0.001). TET2 mutations occurred in 8 patients, and were associated with significantly shorter LFS (P=0.015) but not OS. Patients negative for KIT-AL and TET2 mutations (N=41) had significantly better LFS (P<0.001) and OS (P=0.012) than those positive for both or either mutation. Multivariate analysis showed that KIT-AL and TET2 mutations were associated with inferior LFS, whereas age 40 years and marrow blast 70% were associated with inferior OS.

Inhibition of Pol I by CX-5461 can selectively induce p53-mediated apoptosis of tumour cells in vivo. Currently, CX-5461 is in clinical trial for patients with advanced haematological malignancies (Peter Mac, Melbourne). Here we demonstrate that CX-5461 also induces p53-independent cell cycle checkpoints mediated by ATM/ATR signaling in the absence of DNA damage. Further, our data demonstrate that the combination of drugs targeting ATM/ATR signaling and CX-5461 leads to enhanced therapeutic benefit in treating p53-null tumours in vivo, which are normally refractory to each drug alone. Mechanistically, we show that CX-5461 induces an unusual chromatin structure in which transcriptionally competent relaxed rDNA repeats are devoid of transcribing Pol I leading to activation of ATM signaling within the nucleoli. Thus, we propose that acute inhibition of Pol transcription initiation by CX-5461 induces a novel nucleolar stress response that can be targeted to improve therapeutic efficacy.",,"['Quin, Jaclyn',

We also discuss studies conducted in acute myeloid leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-HL and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Although research in this area is still emerging, it appears that a subset of chemotherapy-treated haematological malignancy survivors experience CRCI.

Infant leukemias are a subgroup with frequent MLL (KMT2A) rearrangements, FLT3 overexpression and high sensitivity to cytarabine, but dismal prognosis. Cytarabine is transported into cells by Human Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter-1 (hENT1, SLC29A1), but the mechanisms that regulate hENT1 in acute leukemia have been scarcely studied.We explored the expression and functional link between FLT3 and main cytarabine transporters in 50 pediatric patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and MLL rearrangement (ALL-MLL+) and other subtypes of leukemia, and in leukemia cell lines.A significant positive correlation was found between FLT3 and hENT1 expression in patients. Cytarabine uptake into cells was mediated mainly by hENT1, hENT2 and hCNT1. hENT1-mediated uptake of cytarabine was transiently abolished by the FLT3 inhibitor PKC412, and this effect was associated with decreased hENT1 mRNA and protein levels. Noticeably, the cytotoxicity of cytarabine was lower when cells were first exposed to FLT3 inhibitors (PKC412 or AC220), probably due to decreased hENT1 activity, but we observed a higher cytotoxic effect if FLT3 inhibitors were administered after cytarabine.FLT3 regulates hENT1 activity and thereby affects cytarabine cytotoxicity.

In addition, ME-344 was cytotoxic to primary AML patient samples over normal hematopoietic cells. In an OCI-AML2 xenograft model, ME-344 reduced tumor growth by up to 95% of control without evidence of toxicity. Mechanistically, ME-344 increased mitochondrial ROS generation in leukemic cells. However, antioxidant treatment did not rescue cell death, suggesting that ME-344 had additional targets beyond the mitochondria. We demonstrated that ME-344 inhibited tubulin polymerization by interacting with tubulin near the colchicine-binding site. Furthermore, inhibition of tubulin polymerization was functionally important for ME-344 induced death. Finally, we showed that ME-344 synergizes with vinblastine in leukemia cells.

To determine whether targeting FGFR1 in both of these AML subtypes can suppress leukemogenesis, we evaluated the effects of different FGFR1 inhibitors in a side-by-side comparison for their ability to affect in vitro proliferation in FGFR1 overexpressing murine and human cells lines. Three newly developed pan-FGFR inhibitors, AZD4547, BGJ398 and JNJ42756493, show a significantly improved efficacy over the more established FGFR inhibitors, PD173074 and TKI258. To examine whether targeting FGFR1 suppresses leukemogenesis in de novo AML in vivo, we created xenografts in immunocompromized mice from primary, de novo AML that showed > 3-fold increased expression of FGFR1. Using BGJ398, the most potent inhibitor identified in the in vitro studies, AML progression in these mice was significantly suppressed compared with vehicle treated animals and overall survival improved. Importantly, no difference in disease course or survival was seen in AML xenografts that did not show overexpression of FGFR1.

We studied B-ALL and T-ALL patients without CRLF2 rearrangement and observed that CRLF2 is significantly increased in a subset of these patients. Our study shows that high CRLF2expression correlates with high-risk ALL markers, as well as poor survival. We found that the IKZF1-encoded protein, Ikaros, directly binds to the CRLF2 promoter and regulates CRLF2 expression in leukemia cells. CK2 inhibitor, which can increase Ikaros activity, significantly increases Ikaros binding in ALL cells and suppresses CRLF2 expression in an Ikaros-dependent manner. CRLF2 expression is significantly higher in patients with IKZF1 deletion as compared to patients without IKZF1 deletion. Treatment with CK2 inhibitor also results in an increase in IKZF1 binding to the CRLF2 promoter and suppression of CRLF2 expression in primary ALL cells. We further observed that CK2 inhibitor induces increased H3K9me3 histone modifications in the CRLF2 promoter in ALL cell lines and primary cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that high expression of CRLF2 correlates with high-risk ALL and short survival in patients without CRLF2 rearrangement. Our results are the first to demonstrate that the IKZF1-encoded Ikaros protein directly suppresses CRLF2 expression through enrichment of H3K9me3 in its promoter region.

Here, we present a novel clinical and functional significance of NOTCH1 alterations in early stage tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the Notch signaling pathway in 68 early stage TSCC primary tumor samples by whole exome and transcriptome sequencing, real-time PCR based copy number, expression, immuno-histochemical, followed by cell based biochemical and functional assays. RESULTS: We show, unlike TCGA HNSCC data set, NOTCH1 harbors significantly lower frequency of inactivating mutations (4%); is somatically amplified; and, overexpressed in 31% and 37% of early stage TSCC patients, respectively. HNSCC cell lines over expressing NOTCH1, when plated in the absence of attachment, are enriched in stem cell markers and form spheroids. Furthermore, we show that inhibition of NOTCH activation by gamma secretase inhibitor or shRNA mediated knockdown of NOTCH1 inhibits spheroid forming capacity, transformation, survival and migration of the HNSCC cells suggesting an oncogenic role of NOTCH1 in TSCC. Clinically, Notch pathway activation is higher in tumors of non-smokers compared to smokers (50% Vs 18%, respectively, P=0.026) and is also associated with greater nodal positivity compared to its non-activation (93% Vs 64%, respectively, P=0.029).

Irrespective of its therapeutic and multidimensional potentiality, the structural studies are still elusive. Moreover, the mechanism of BMAP27 mediated pore formation in heterogeneous lipid membrane systems is poorly explored. Here, we studied the effect of BMAP27 in model cell-membrane systems such as zwitterionic, anionic, thymocytes-like (TLM) and leukemia-like membranes (LLM) by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulation longer than 100 mus. All-atom MD studies revealed a stable helical conformation in the presence of anionic lipids, however, significant loss of helicity was identified in TLM and zwitterionic systems. A peptide tilt (~45 ) and central kink (at residue F10) was found in anionic and LLM models, respectively, with an average membrane penetration of < 0.5 nm. Coarse-grained (CG) MD analysis on a multi-mus scale shed light on the membrane-dependent peptide and lipid organization. Stable micelle and end-to-end like oligomers were formed in zwitterionic and TLM models, respectively. In contrast, unstable oligomer formation and monomeric BMAP27 penetration were observed in anionic and LLM systems with selective anionic lipid aggregation (in LLM). Peptide penetration up to ~1.5 nm was observed in CG-MD systems with the BMAP27 C-terminal oriented towards the bilayer core. Structural inspection suggested membrane penetration by micelle/end-to-end like peptide oligomers (carpet-model like) in the zwitterionic/TLM systems, and transmembrane-mode (toroidal-pore like) in the anionic/LLM systems, respectively. Structural insights and energetic interpretation in BMAP27 mutant highlighted the role of F10 and hydrophobic residues in mediating a membrane-specific peptide interaction. Free energy profiling showed a favorable (-4.58 kcal mol-1 for LLM) and unfavorable (+0.17 kcal mol-1 for TLM) peptide insertion in anionic and neutral systems, respectively.

The active-site mTOR inhibitors (asTORi) represent a promising new approach to targeting mTOR in AKT/mTOR signaling. MLN0128 is an orally-administered, second-generation asTORi, currently in clinical development. We examined the anti-leukemic effects and the mechanisms of action of MLN0128 in AML cell lines and primary samples, with a particular focus on its effect in AML stem/progenitor cells. MLN0128 inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in AML by attenuating the activity of mTOR complex 1 and 2. Using time-of-flight mass cytometry, we demonstrated that MLN0128 selectively targeted and functionally inhibited AML stem/progenitor cells with high AKT/mTOR signaling activity. Using the reverse-phase protein array technique, we measured expression and phosphorylation changes in response to MLN0128 in 151 proteins from 24 primary AML samples and identified several pro-survival pathways that antagonize MLN0128-induced cellular stress. A combined blockade of AKT/mTOR signaling and these pro-survival pathways facilitated AML cell killing.

Clonal evolutions are significantly associated with transformation to AML. According to a gene expression microarray, atg3 is downregulated in MDS patients progressing to leukemia, but less is known about the function of Atg3 in the survival and death of MSD/AML cells. Moreover, the role of autophagy as a result of bortezomib treatment is controversial. The current study was designed to investigate the function of Atg3 in SKM-1 cells and to study the effect of Atg3 on cell viability and cell death following bortezomib treatment. METHODS: Four leukemia cell lines (SKM-1, THP-1, NB4 and K562) and two healthy patients' bone marrow cells were analyzed for Atg3 expression via qRT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. The role of Atg3 in SKM-1 cell survival and cell death was analyzed by CCK-8 assay, trypan blue exclusion assay, DAPI staining and Annexin V/PI dual staining with or without bortezomib treatment. Western blotting analysis was used to detect proteins in autophagic and caspase signaling pathways. Electron microscopy was used to observe ultrastructural changes after Atg3 overexpression. RESULTS: Downregulation of Atg3 expression was detected in four leukemia cell lines compared with healthy bone marrow cells. Atg3 mRNA was significantly decreased in MDS patients' bone marrow cells. Overexpression of Atg3 in SKM-1 cells resulted in AKT-mTOR-dependent autophagy, a significant reduction in cell proliferation and increased cell death, which could be overcome by the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. SKM-1 cells overexpressing Atg3 were hypersensitive to bortezomib treatment at different concentrations via autophagic cell death and enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis in the SKM-1 cell line. Following treatment with 3-MA, the sensitivity of Atg3-overexpressing cells to bortezomib treatment was reduced. Atg3 knockdown blocked cell growth inhibition and cell death induced by bortezomib. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary study of Atg3 in the high-risk MDS cell line suggests that Atg3 might be possibly a critical regulator of autophagic cell death and a gene target for therapeutic interventions in MDS.",,"['Zhuang, Lin', 'Ma, Yan', 'Wang, Qian', 'Zhang, Jing', 'Zhu, Chen', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Xu, Xiaoping']","['Zhuang L', 'Ma Y', 'Wang Q', 'Zhang J', 'Zhu C', 'Zhang L', 'Xu X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160708,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ATG3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Autophagy-Related Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bortezomib/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC4938461,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/08/19 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0158761 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-55709 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jul 8;11(7):e0158761. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0158761. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports indicated that a subpopulation of myeloid cells, defined as granulocyte-like myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC) is increased in these patients. So far, the role of MSC in MDSC expansion and activation into the BM microenvironment remains unexplored. To address this question, here we use a specific experimental model in vitro, co-culturing MSC with peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMC) from normal individuals, in order to generate MSC-educated G-MDSC. Although MSC of healthy donors (HD) and CML patients were able to generate the same amount of MDSC, only CML-MSC-educated G-MDSC exhibited suppressive ability on autologous T lymphocytes. In addition, compared with HD-MSC, CML-MSC over-expressed some immunomodulatory factors including TGFbeta, IL6 and IL10, that could be involved in MDSC activation. CML-MSC-educated G-MDSC expressed higher levels of ARG1, TNFalpha, IL1beta, COX2 and IL6 than G-MDSC isolated from co-culture with HD-MSC.

In this study, we reported that DAS-loaded NPs exhibited potent anti-leukemia efficacy as DAS alone.

Herein, we conducted a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of ATRA plus ATO with ATRA plus chemotherapy for adult patients with newly diagnosed APL. METHODS: We systematically searched biomedical electronic databases and conference proceedings through February 2016. Two reviewers independently assessed all studies for relevance and validity. RESULTS: Overall, three studies were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis, which included a total of 585 patients, with 317 in ATRA plus ATO group and 268 in ATRA plus chemotherapy group. Compared with patients who received ATRA and chemotherapy, patients who received ATRA plus ATO had a significantly better event-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.22-0.67, p = 0.009), overall survival (HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.24-0.82, p = 0.009), complete remission rate (relative risk [RR] = 1.05; 95% CI: 1.01-1.10; p = 0.03). There were no significant differences in early mortality (RR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.22-1.05; p = 0.07).

In addition to its classical receptor CD40, CD154 is capable of binding other receptors, members of the integrin family, the alphaIIbbeta3, alphaMbeta2 and alpha5beta1. Given the role attributed to integrins and particularly the beta1 integrins in inhibiting apoptotic events in normal as well as malignant T cells, we were highly interested in investigating the role of the CD154/alpha5beta1 interaction in promoting survival of malignant T cells contributing as such to tumor development and/or propagation. To support our hypothesis, we first show that soluble CD154 binds to the T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, Jurkat E6.1 in a alpha5beta1-dependent manner. Binding of soluble CD154 to alpha5beta1 integrin of Jurkat cells leads to the activation of key survival proteins, including the p38 and ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI-3K), and Akt. Interestingly, soluble CD154 significantly inhibits Fas-mediated apoptosis in T cell leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, Jurkat E6.1 and HUT78 cells, an important hallmark of T cell survival during malignancy progression. These anti-apoptotic effects were mainly mediated by the activation of the PI-3K/Akt pathway but also involved the p38 and the ERK1/2 MAPKs cascades. Our data also demonstrated that the CD154-triggered inhibition of the Fas-mediated cell death response was dependent on a suppression of caspase-8 cleavage, but independent of de novo protein synthesis or alterations in Fas expression on cell surface. Together, our results highlight the impact of the CD154/alpha5beta1 interaction in T cell function/survival and identify novel targets for the treatment of malignant disorders, particularly of T cell origin.",,"['Bachsais, Meriem', 'Naddaf, Nadim', 'Yacoub, Daniel', 'Salti, Suzanne', 'Alaaeddine, Nada', 'Aoudjit, Fawzi', 'Hassan, Ghada S', 'Mourad, Walid']","['Bachsais M', 'Naddaf N', 'Yacoub D', 'Salti S', 'Alaaeddine N', 'Aoudjit F', 'Hassan GS', 'Mourad W']",,"[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada."", 'Department of Pathology, 11-5076, Faculty of Medicine, St Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Centre de recherche en immunologie et rhumatologie, CHUL, 2705, Boul Laurier, QC, Canada.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada."", ""Laboratoire d'Immunologie Cellulaire et Moleculaire, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite de Montreal, 900 rue Saint-Denis, Tour Viger, Room 10-482, Montreal, QC, Canada.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160708,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (FAS protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (integrin alphavbeta1)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Caspase 8/immunology', 'Cell Death/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*immunology', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'fas Receptor/*immunology']",PMC4938623,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/07/21 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0158987 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-16408 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jul 8;11(7):e0158987. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0158987. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have shown that p53 is either mutated or defective in approximately 50% of human cancers; therefore restoring normal p53 activity in cancer cells might be an effective anticancer therapeutic approach. Herein, we designed a chimeric p53 protein flanked with the MyoD N-terminal transcriptional activation domain (amino acids 1-62, called M3) and a poly-arginine (R12) cell penetrating signal in its N-and C-termini respectively. This chimeric protein, M3-p53-R12, can be expressed in E. coli and purified using immobilized metal ion chromatography followed by serial refolding dialysis. The purified M3-p53-R12 protein retains DNA-binding activity and gains of cell penetrating ability. Using MTT assay, we demonstrated that M3-p53-R12 inhibited the growth of K562, Jurkat as well as HL-60 leukemia cells carrying mutant p53 genes. Results from FACS analysis also demonstrated that transduction of M3-p53-R12 protein induced cell cycle arrest of these leukemia cells. Of special note, M3-p53-R12 has no apoptotic effect on normal mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) and leukocytes, highlighting its differential effects on normal and tumor cells. To sum up, our results reveal that purified recombinant M3-p53-R12 protein has functions of suppressing the leukemia cell lines' proliferation and launching cell apoptosis, suggesting the feasibility of using M3-p53-R12 protein as an anticancer drug. In the future we will test whether this chimeric protein can preferentially trigger the death of malignant cancer cells without affecting normal cells in animals carrying endogenous or xenographic tumors.",,"['Lu, Tsung Chi', 'Zhao, Guan-Hao', 'Chen, Yao Yun', 'Chien, Chia-Ying', 'Huang, Chi-Hung', 'Lin, Kwang Hui', 'Chen, Shen Liang']","['Lu TC', 'Zhao GH', 'Chen YY', 'Chien CY', 'Huang CH', 'Lin KH', 'Chen SL']",,"['1.

Monocytes/Macrophages play an important role in the onset and progression of solid cancers. However, little is known about their role in the development of acute myeloid leukemia, a malignant disease characterized by an aberrant development of the myeloid compartment of the hematopoietic system. It is also unclear which factors are responsible for changing the status of macrophage polarization, thus supporting the growth of malignant cells instead of inhibiting it. We report herein that acute myeloid leukemia leads to the invasion of acute myeloid leukemia-associated macrophages into the bone marrow and spleen of leukemic patients and mice. In different leukemic mouse models, these macrophages support the in vitro expansion of acute myeloid leukemia cell lines better than macrophages from non-leukemic mice. The grade of macrophage infiltration correlates in vivo with the survival of the mice. We found that the transcriptional repressor Growth factor independence 1 is crucial in the process of macrophage polarization, since its absence impedes macrophage polarization towards a leukemia supporting state and favors an anti-tumor state both in vitro and in vivo These results not only suggest that acute myeloid leukemia-associated macrophages play an important role in the progression of acute myeloid leukemia, but also implicate Growth factor independence 1 as a pivotal factor in macrophage polarization.

Gain of chromosome 8 is the most common chromosomal gain in human acute myeloid leukemia, including acute promyelocytic leukemia. We previously demonstrated that gain of chromosome 8-containing MYC is of central importance in trisomy 8, but the role of the nearby TRIB1 gene has not been experimentally addressed in this context. We have now tested the hypothesis that both MYC and TRIB1 have functional roles underlying leukemogenesis of trisomy 8 by using retroviral vectors to express MYC and TRIB1 in wild-type bone marrow and in marrow that expressed a PML/RARA transgene. Interestingly, although MYC and TRIB1 readily co-operated in leukemogenesis for wild-type bone marrow, TRIB1 provided no selective advantage to cells expressing PML/RARA. We hypothesized that this lack of co-operation between PML/RARA and TRIB1 reflected a common pathway for their effect: both proteins targeting the myeloid transcription factor C/EBPalpha. In support of this idea, TRIB1 expression abrogated the all-trans retinoic acid response of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo Our data delineate the common and redundant inhibitory effects of TRIB1 and PML/RARA on C/EBPalpha providing a potential explanation for the lack of selection of TRIB1 in human acute promyelocytic leukemia, and highlighting the key role of C/EBPs in acute promyelocytic leukemia pathogenesis and therapeutic response.

The region of Lazio, Central Italy, represents an interesting case study to evaluate the evolution of costs for these eradication programmes, as in some provinces the eradication has been officially achieved, in some others the prevalence has been close to zero for years, and in still others disease outbreaks have been continuously reported. The objectives of this study were i) to describe the costs for the eradication programmes for tuberculosis, brucellosis and leucosis in cattle carried out in Lazio between 2007 and 2011, ii) to calculate the ratio between the financial contribution of the European Union (EU) for the eradication programmes and the estimated total costs and iii) to estimate the potential savings that can be made when a province gains the certification of freedom from disease. For the i) and ii) objectives, data were collected from official sources and a costing procedure was applied from the perspective of the Regional Health Service. For the iii) objective, a Bayesian AR(1) regression was used to evaluate the average percentage reduction in costs for a province that gained the certification.

Recently, germ line JAK2 mutations were associated with polyclonal hereditary thrombocytosis and triple-negative MPNs. We studied a patient who inherited 2 heterozygous JAK2 mutations, E846D from the mother and R1063H from the father, and exhibited erythrocytosis and megakaryocytic atypia but normal platelet number. Culture of erythroid progenitors from the patient and his parents revealed hypersensitivity to erythropoietin (EPO). Using cellular models, we show that both E846D and R1063H variants lead to constitutive signaling (albeit much weaker than JAK2 V617F), and both weakly hyperactivate JAK2/STAT5 signaling only in the specific context of the EPO receptor (EPOR). JAK2 E846D exhibited slightly stronger effects than JAK2 R1063H and caused prolonged EPO-induced phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT5 via EPOR. We propose that JAK2 E846D predominantly contributes to erythrocytosis, but is not sufficient for the full pathological phenotype to develop. JAK2 R1063H, with very weak effect on JAK2/STAT5 signaling, is necessary to augment JAK2 activity caused by E846D above a threshold level leading to erythrocytosis with megakaryocyte abnormalities. Both mutations were detected in the germ line of rare polycythemia vera, as well as certain leukemia patients, suggesting that they might predispose to hematological malignancy.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kapralova, Katarina', 'Horvathova, Monika', 'Pecquet, Christian', 'Fialova Kucerova, Jana', 'Pospisilova, Dagmar', 'Leroy, Emilie', 'Kralova, Barbora', 'Milosevic Feenstra, Jelena D', 'Schischlik, Fiorella', 'Kralovics, Robert', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Divoky, Vladimir']","['Kapralova K', 'Horvathova M', 'Pecquet C', 'Fialova Kucerova J', 'Pospisilova D', 'Leroy E', 'Kralova B', 'Milosevic Feenstra JD', 'Schischlik F', 'Kralovics R', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Divoky V']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8808-9411', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7420-3298', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6997-8539']","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic; Signal Transduction and Molecular Hematology Unit, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium; de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium;', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic;', 'Signal Transduction and Molecular Hematology Unit, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium; de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium;', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Olomouc, Czech Republic; and.', 'Signal Transduction and Molecular Hematology Unit, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium; de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium;', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic;', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria.', 'Signal Transduction and Molecular Hematology Unit, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels, Belgium; de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium;', 'Department of Biology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic;']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160707,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'Polycythemia, primary familial and congenital']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Germ-Line Mutation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polycythemia/*congenital/genetics', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/10 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34161-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-02-698951 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 8;128(10):1418-23. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-02-698951.

Although large immunoblasts frequently appear in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, the diffuse infiltration of these cells can cause difficulty in establishing a differential diagnosis from lymphoma. In such cases, CD30 immunostaining may be used; however, the extent or distribution pattern of CD30-positive cells in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease remains largely unknown. Here we investigated the expression of CD30 and its clinicopathologic significance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated 30 Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease and 16 control [6, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); 10, reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH)] cases. RESULTS: The number of CD30-positive cells in Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease was significantly more than that in SLE and RLH, and majority of these cells were located around necrotic areas. Moreover, double immunohistochemical staining showed these CD30-positive cells to be CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, suggesting that activated cytotoxic T cells around necrotic areas are a characteristic feature of this disease. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that cases with abundant CD30-positive cells were predominantly female with only mild symptoms and normal laboratory data. CONCLUSIONS: In Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease cases, CD30-positive cytotoxic T cells were abundant around necrotic areas; this histologic feature may be helpful to differentiate this disease from SLE and RLH.",,"['Tabata, Tetsuya', 'Takata, Katsuyoshi', 'Miyata-Takata, Tomoko', 'Sato, Yasuharu', 'Ishizawa, Shin', 'Kunitomo, Tomoyoshi', 'Nagakita, Keina', 'Ohnishi, Nobuhiko', 'Taniguchi, Kohei', 'Noujima-Harada, Mai', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu', 'Tanimoto, Mitsune', 'Yoshino, Tadashi']","['Tabata T', 'Takata K', 'Miyata-Takata T', 'Sato Y', 'Ishizawa S', 'Kunitomo T', 'Nagakita K', 'Ohnishi N', 'Taniguchi K', 'Noujima-Harada M', 'Maeda Y', 'Tanimoto M', 'Yoshino T']",,"['Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Toyama Prefectural Central Hospital, Toyama.', 'Department of Surgery, Iwakuni Medical Center, Iwakuni, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama.', 'Department of Pathology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol,Applied immunohistochemistry & molecular morphology : AIMM,100888796,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Movement', 'Child', 'Female', 'Histiocytic Necrotizing Lymphadenitis/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*metabolism', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*diagnosis', 'Lymphadenopathy', 'Male', 'Necrosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Pseudolymphoma/*diagnosis', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,2016/07/09 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAI.0000000000000411 [doi]'],ppublish,Appl Immunohistochem Mol Morphol. 2018 Apr;26(4):274-282. doi: 10.1097/PAI.0000000000000411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon, commonly referred to as 'immune evasion,' represents a hallmark of cancers and results from a Darwinian selection of the fittest tumor clones. First reported in solid tumors, cancer immunoescape characterizes several hematological malignancies. The biological bases of cancer immunoescape have recently been disclosed and include: (i) impaired human leukocyte antigen-mediated cancer cell recognition (B2M, CD58, CTIIA, CD80/CD86, CD28 and CTLA-4 mutations); (ii) deranged apoptotic mechanisms (reduced pro-apoptotic signals and/or increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules); and (iii) changes in the tumor microenvironment involving regulatory T cells and tumor-associated macrophages. These immune-escape mechanisms characterize both Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin (B and T cell) lymphomas and represent a promising target for new anti-tumor therapies. In the present review, the principles of cancer immunoescape and their role in human lymphomagenesis are illustrated. Current therapies targeting these pathways and possible applications for lymphoma treatment are also addressed.",,"['Pizzi, M', 'Boi, M', 'Bertoni, F', 'Inghirami, G']","['Pizzi M', 'Boi M', 'Bertoni F', 'Inghirami G']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4006-7317'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'General Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, Department of Medicine-DIMED, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Lymphoma and Genomics Research Program, IOR Institute of Oncology Research, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'IOSI Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland, Bellinzona, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Science and Center for Experimental Research and Medical Studies (CeRMS), University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology and NYU Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160608,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Humans', 'Immune System/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', '*Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/08/30 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2016161 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2016 Sep;30(9):1805-15. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.161.

To identify the genetic changes that drive this transformation, we sequenced the exomes of 12 cases with paired FL and tFL biopsies and identified 45 recurrently mutated genes in the FL-tFL data set and 39 in the tFL cases. We selected 496 genes of potential importance in transformation and sequenced them in 23 additional tFL cases. Integration of the mutation data with copy-number abnormality (CNA) data provided complementary information. We found recurrent mutations of miR-142, which has not been previously been reported to be mutated in FL/tFL. The genes most frequently mutated in tFL included KMT2D (MLL2), CREBBP, EZH2, BCL2 and MEF2B. Many recurrently mutated genes are involved in epigenetic regulation, the Janus-activated kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) or the nuclear factor-kappaB pathways, immune surveillance and cell cycle regulation or are TFs involved in B-cell development. Of particular interest are mutations and CNAs affecting S1P-activated pathways through S1PR1 or S1PR2, which likely regulate lymphoma cell migration and survival outside of follicles.

The genetic basis of AEL remains poorly defined. Through whole-exome sequencing, we identified high frequencies of mutations in CEBPA (32.7%), GATA2 (22.4%), NPM1 (15.5%), SETBP1 (12.1%) and U2AF1 (12.1%). Structure prediction analysis revealed that most of the GATA2 mutations were located at the DNA-binding N-terminal zinc-finger near the DNA-binding interface, suggesting that mutations could result in at least partial inactivation of GATA2 protein. On co-transfection of a GATA-responsive reporter construct together with plasmids expressing either GATA2 wild-type or GATA2 ZF1 mutants (P304H, L321P and R330X) in 293T cells, we found a reduced transcriptional activation in cells transfected with GATA2 mutants. To determine whether reduced GATA2 function is involved in leukemogenesis of AEL, we transfected 32D cells with GATA2 mutants and evaluated the impact of GATA2 mutations on erythroid differentiation. Our data revealed an increased expression of erythroid-related antigens Ter-119, beta-globin and betah1-globin, as well as increased hemoglobin positivity in 32D cells transfected with GATA2 mutants compared with control cells.

CSF2RA, the gene encoding the alpha-subunit for GM-CSF, is significantly downregulated in t(8;21) (RUNX1-ETO or RE) leukemia patients, suggesting that it may serve as a tumor suppressor. We previously reported that GM-CSF signaling is inhibitory to RE leukemogenesis. Here we conducted gene expression profiling of primary RE hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) treated with GM-CSF to elucidate the mechanisms mediating the negative effects of GM on RE leukemogenicity. We observed that GM treatment of RE HSPCs resulted in a unique gene expression profile that resembles primary human cells undergoing myelopoiesis, which was not observed in control HSPCs. Additionally, we discovered that GM-CSF signaling attenuates MYC-associated gene signatures in RE HSPCs. In agreement with this, a functional screen of a subset of GM-CSF-responsive genes demonstrated that a MYC inhibitor, MXI1 (Max interactor 1), reduced the leukemic potential of RE HSPCs and t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Furthermore, MYC knockdown and treatment with the BET (bromodomain and extra terminal domain) inhibitor JQ1 reduced the leukemic potential of t(8;21) cell lines. Altogether, we discovered a novel molecular mechanism mediating the GM-CSF-induced reduction in leukemic potential of RE cells, and our findings support MYC inhibition as an effective strategy for reducing the leukemogenicity of t(8;21) AML.",,"['Weng, S', 'Matsuura, S', 'Mowery, C T', 'Stoner, S A', 'Lam, K', 'Ran, D', 'Davis, A G', 'Lo, M-C', 'Zhang, D-E']","['Weng S', 'Matsuura S', 'Mowery CT', 'Stoner SA', 'Lam K', 'Ran D', 'Davis AG', 'Lo MC', 'Zhang DE']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3914-5376'],"['Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Division of Biological Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['R01 CA192924/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA067754/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007198/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007240/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160615,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MXI1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*etiology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*adverse effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/physiology']",PMC5214981,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/08/31 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2016/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/31 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['leu2016167 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2016.167 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2017 Jan;31(1):159-169. doi: 10.1038/leu.2016.167.

To understand the order of occurrence of MLL-PTD in relation to other major AML mutations and to identify novel mutations that may be present in this unique AML molecular subtype, exome and targeted sequencing was performed on 85 MLL-PTD AML samples using HiSeq-2000. Genes involved in the cohesin complex (STAG2), a splicing factor (U2AF1) and a poorly studied gene, MGA were recurrently mutated, whereas NPM1, one of the most frequently mutated AML gene, was not mutated in MLL-PTD patients. Interestingly, clonality analysis suggests that IDH2/1, DNMT3A, U2AF1 and TET2 mutations are clonal and occur early, and MLL-PTD likely arises after these initial mutations. Conversely, proliferative mutations (FLT3, RAS), typically appear later, are largely subclonal and tend to be unstable.

This study evaluated the clinical relevance of 4-1BBL, glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related protein (GITR) and ligand (GITRL), CD80, and CD86 in case of expression on AML blasts. 98 patients were evaluated at initial diagnosis. Immunophenotypically evaluated specific fluorescence index (SFI) levels of COR and COL on blasts were correlated with morphological, cytogenetic, and several prognostic parameters. Significantly higher COR expression was seen in monocytic versus non-monocytic AML subtypes; GITR, p=0.05; GITRL, p=0.005; CD86, p=0.001). Cut-off values for two COR and their ligands were evaluated: cases presenting with 4-1BB values above cut-off 1.2 SFI levels correlated (tendentially) significantly with a higher probability for disease-free survival (DFS, p=0.06) and a favorable HR of 0.2; p=0.04 for relapse. HR for death was also significantly lower in this group (0.12; p=0.04).

Assessment of myeloid and monocytic 'immunophenotypic' dysplasia by flow cytometry in de novo AML has not been evaluated. METHODS: 97 cases of de novo AML cases were identified and reviewed by three hematopathologists. 'Immunophenotypic' dysplasia was assessed on blasts, monocytes and granulocytes by mean fluorescence intensity. RESULTS: Using the 2008 WHO classification criteria, there were 53 AML-not otherwise specified (NOS) (55%) and 28 AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) (29%), while 16 cases were ambiguous as to AML-MRC status due to limited maturing cells for morphologic but adequate events number for immunophenotypic evaluation (AML-not evaluable, 16%). Compared with AML-NOS, granulocytic cells in AML-MRC had higher CD33 expression but lower CD45, CD11b and CD15. Monocytes in AML-MRC had lower expression of CD14, CD56 and CD45. Morphologic dysplasia was associated with significantly lower granulocytic forward scatter, side scatter and CD10 but higher CD33 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the workup of AML cases should include flow cytometric assessment of granulocytes and monocytes. This analysis can aid a morphologic impression of multilineage dysplasia in distinguishing AML-MRC from AML-NOS, especially in cases with limited maturing myeloid cells.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Due to the development of drug resistance, few FLT3-ITD inhibitors are effective against FLT3-ITD+ AML. In this study, we show that FLT3-ITD activates a novel pathway involving p21Cdkn1a (p21) and pre-B cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (Pbx1) that attenuates FLT3-ITD cell proliferation and is involved in the development of drug resistance. FLT3-ITD up-regulated p21 expression in both mouse bone marrow c-kit+-Sca-1+-Lin- (KSL) cells and Ba/F3 cells. The loss of p21 expression enhanced growth factor-independent proliferation and sensitivity to cytarabine as a consequence of concomitantly enriching the S+G2/M phase population and significantly increasing the expression of Pbx1, but not Evi-1, in FLT3-ITD+ cells. This enhanced cell proliferation following the loss of p21 was partially abrogated when Pbx1 expression was silenced in FLT3-ITD+ primary bone marrow colony-forming cells and Ba/F3 cells. When FLT3-ITD was antagonized with AC220, a selective inhibitor of FLT3-ITD, p21 expression was decreased coincident with Pbx1 mRNA up-regulation and a rapid decline in the number of viable FLT3-ITD+ Ba/F3 cells; however, the cells eventually became refractory to AC220. Overexpressing p21 in FLT3-ITD+ Ba/F3 cells delayed the emergence of cells that were refractory to AC220, whereas p21 silencing accelerated their development. These data indicate that FLT3-ITD is capable of inhibiting FLT3-ITD+ cell proliferation through the p21/Pbx1 axis and that treatments that antagonize FLT3-ITD contribute to the subsequent development of cells that are refractory to a FLT3-ITD inhibitor by disrupting p21 expression.",,"['Abe, Mariko', 'Pelus, Louis M', 'Singh, Pratibha', 'Hirade, Tomohiro', 'Onishi, Chie', 'Purevsuren, Jamiyan', 'Taketani, Takeshi', 'Yamaguchi, Seiji', 'Fukuda, Seiji']","['Abe M', 'Pelus LM', 'Singh P', 'Hirade T', 'Onishi C', 'Purevsuren J', 'Taketani T', 'Yamaguchi S', 'Fukuda S']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Division of Blood Transfusion, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Shimane University School of Medicine, Izumo, Shimane, Japan.']",['eng'],['R01 HL079654/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Journal Article'],20160707,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/chemistry', 'Benzothiazoles/*chemistry', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*chemistry', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC4936702,2016/07/09 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/07/09 06:00'],"['2015/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0158290 [doi]', 'PONE-D-15-51151 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jul 7;11(7):e0158290. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0158290. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of MRTF-A in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still unclear. Here, we showed that MRTF-A was significantly downregulated in cortex of the Abeta25-35-induced AD rats, which played a key role in Abeta25-35 induced cerebral neuronal degeneration in vitro. Bilateral intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta25-35 caused significantly MRTF-A expression decline in cortex of rats, along with significant neuron apoptosis and plasticity damage. In vitro, transfection of MRTF-A into primary cultured cortical neurons prevented Abeta25-35 induced neuronal apoptosis and synapses injury. And luciferase reporter assay determined that MRTF-A could bind to and enhance the transactivity of the Mcl-1 (Myeloid cell leukemia-1) and Arc (activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein) promoters by activating the key CArG box element. These data demonstrated that the decreasing of endogenous MRTF-A expression might contribute to the development of AD, whereas the upregulation MRTF-A in neurons could effectively reduce Abeta25-35 induced synapse injury and cell apoptosis. And the underlying mechanism might be partially due to MRTF-A-mediated the transcription and expression of Mcl-1 and Arc by triggering the CArG box.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Given the 58% response rate (1996 NCI-WG criteria) of single agent ofatumumab in CLL refractory to fludarabine and alemtuzumab, we initiated a phase II trial examining response, safety, and progression-free survival (PFS) of ofatumumab as front-line monotherapy. Patients enrolled included untreated, symptomatic CLL patients over the age of 65 or those who were inappropriate/did not desire chemotherapy. Two cohorts were enrolled sequentially examining either 1 g (33 patients) or 2 g (44 patients) weekly for 8 weeks followed by maintenance dosing every 2 months for a total of 24 months. Patients receiving 1 g were older than those receiving 2 g, but there were no significant differences in other clinical characteristics. The best overall response rates in the 1 and 2 g patient cohorts were 72 and 89% (1996 NCI-WG criteria), respectively (54 and 68%, respectively, using 2008 IWCLL criteria). All but two responses were partial. The 24-month estimated PFS rates were 46 and 78%, respectively. Response and PFS was lower in del(17p) and del(11q) CLL patients. Differences in PFS between dose cohorts were statistically significant and remained so when adjusting for age or high-risk cytogenetics. Toxicity of this treatment was mild with only six patients not completing therapy due to toxicity. Ofatumumab induction followed by maintenance therapy in untreated CLL represents a well-tolerated and active regimen, particularly with the 2 g of ofatumumab. Am. J. Hematol. 91:1020-1025, 2016.

The Americas provide a unique opportunity to disentangle these factors as human colonization took place over a narrow time frame (~15 to 14.6 ka) but during contrasting temperature trends across each continent. Unfortunately, limited data sets in South America have so far precluded detailed comparison. We analyze genetic and radiocarbon data from 89 and 71 Patagonian megafaunal bones, respectively, more than doubling the high-quality Pleistocene megafaunal radiocarbon data sets from the region. We identify a narrow megafaunal extinction phase 12,280 +/- 110 years ago, some 1 to 3 thousand years after initial human presence in the area. Although humans arrived immediately prior to a cold phase, the Antarctic Cold Reversal stadial, megafaunal extinctions did not occur until the stadial finished and the subsequent warming phase commenced some 1 to 3 thousand years later. The increased resolution provided by the Patagonian material reveals that the sequence of climate and extinction events in North and South America were temporally inverted, but in both cases, megafaunal extinctions did not occur until human presence and climate warming coincided. Overall, metapopulation processes involving subpopulation connectivity on a continental scale appear to have been critical for megafaunal species survival of both climate change and human impacts.",,"['Metcalf, Jessica L', 'Turney, Chris', 'Barnett, Ross', 'Martin, Fabiana', 'Bray, Sarah C', 'Vilstrup, Julia T', 'Orlando, Ludovic', 'Salas-Gismondi, Rodolfo', 'Loponte, Daniel', 'Medina, Matias', 'De Nigris, Mariana', 'Civalero, Teresa', 'Fernandez, Pablo Marcelo', 'Gasco, Alejandra', 'Duran, Victor', 'Seymour, Kevin L', 'Otaola, Clara', 'Gil, Adolfo', 'Paunero, Rafael', 'Prevosti, Francisco J', 'Bradshaw, Corey J A', 'Wheeler, Jane C', 'Borrero, Luis', 'Austin, Jeremy J', 'Cooper, Alan']","['Metcalf JL', 'Turney C', 'Barnett R', 'Martin F', 'Bray SC', 'Vilstrup JT', 'Orlando L', 'Salas-Gismondi R', 'Loponte D', 'Medina M', 'De Nigris M', 'Civalero T', 'Fernandez PM', 'Gasco A', 'Duran V', 'Seymour KL', 'Otaola C', 'Gil A', 'Paunero R', 'Prevosti FJ', 'Bradshaw CJ', 'Wheeler JC', 'Borrero L', 'Austin JJ', 'Cooper A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8374-8046', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4023-0284', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6534-8452', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8659-9725', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0511-4720', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9020-0660']","['Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.; Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Ramaley Biology, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO 80309-0334, USA.', 'Climate Change Research Centre, School of Biological, Earth, and Environmental Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.', 'Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre, Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, UK.; Centre for GeoGenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centro de Estudios del Hombre Austral, Instituto de la Patagonia, UMAG, Avenida Bulnes 01890, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'Australian Centre for Ancient DNA, School of Biological Sciences, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia 5005, Australia.; Acute Leukaemia Laboratory, Centre for Cancer Biology, University of South Australia, Adelaide South Australia 5001, Australia.', 'Centre for GeoGenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for GeoGenetics, Natural History Museum of Denmark, University of Copenhagen, Oster Voldgade 5-7, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Institut des Sciences de l'Evolution, Universite de Montpellier, CNRS, IRD, EPHE, Montpellier 34095, France.; Departamento de Paleontologia de Vertebrados, Museo de Historia Natural, UNMSM, Avenida Arenales 1256, Lima 14, Peru."", 'Instituto Nacional de Antropologia y Pensamiento Latinoamericano, C1426BJN Ciudad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Area de Arqueologia y Etnohistoria, Centro de Estudios Historicos ""Prof. Carlos S.A.

To predict the clinical outcome, we previously developed a CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) based on clinical parameters and cytogenetics. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that accounting for gene mutations would further improve risk stratification of CMML patients. We therefore sequenced 38 genes to explore the role of somatic mutations in disease phenotype and clinical outcome. Overall, 199 of 214 (93%) CMML patients carried at least 1 somatic mutation. Stepwise linear regression models showed that these mutations accounted for 15% to 24% of variability of clinical phenotype. Based on multivariable Cox regression analyses, cytogenetic abnormalities and mutations in RUNX1, NRAS, SETBP1, and ASXL1 were independently associated with overall survival (OS). Using these parameters, we defined a genetic score that identified 4 categories with significantly different OS and cumulative incidence of leukemic evolution. In multivariable analyses, genetic score, red blood cell transfusion dependency, white blood cell count, and marrow blasts retained independent prognostic value. These parameters were included into a clinical/molecular CPSS (CPSS-Mol) model that identified 4 risk groups with markedly different median OS (from >144 to 18 months, hazard ratio [HR] = 2.69) and cumulative incidence of leukemic evolution (from 0% to 48% at 4 years, HR = 3.84) (P < .001). The CPSS-Mol fully retained its ability to risk stratify in an independent validation cohort of 260 CMML patients. In conclusion, integrating conventional parameters and gene mutations significantly improves risk stratification of CMML patients, providing a robust basis for clinical decision-making and a reliable tool for clinical trials.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Elena, Chiara', 'Galli, Anna', 'Such, Esperanza', 'Meggendorfer, Manja', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Rizzo, Ettore', 'Cervera, Jose', 'Molteni, Elisabetta', 'Fasan, Annette', 'Schuler, Esther', 'Ambaglio, Ilaria', 'Lopez-Pavia, Maria', 'Zibellini, Silvia', 'Kuendgen, Andrea', 'Travaglino, Erica', 'Sancho-Tello, Reyes', 'Catricala, Silvia', 'Vicente, Ana I', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Haferlach, Claudia', 'Sanz, Guillermo F', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Cazzola, Mario']","['Elena C', 'Galli A', 'Such E', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Germing U', 'Rizzo E', 'Cervera J', 'Molteni E', 'Fasan A', 'Schuler E', 'Ambaglio I', 'Lopez-Pavia M', 'Zibellini S', 'Kuendgen A', 'Travaglino E', 'Sancho-Tello R', 'Catricala S', 'Vicente AI', 'Haferlach T', 'Haferlach C', 'Sanz GF', 'Malcovati L', 'Cazzola M']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain;', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany;', 'Department of Electrical, Computer and Biomedical Engineering, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain;', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy;', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain;', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Arnau de Vilanova, Valencia, Spain; and.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de La Ribera, Alzira, Spain.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany;', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany;', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain;', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; Department of Hematology Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Fondazione Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy;']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160706,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clinical Decision-Making', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/*methods', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",PMC5036538,2016/07/08 06:00,2017/08/08 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2016/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/08 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34160-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2016-05-714030 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Sep 8;128(10):1408-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2016-05-714030.

CASE REPORT: We present a case of acute pre-T-lymphoblastic leukemia in a Jehovah's Witness who did not accept blood transfusion during chemotherapy. Standard induction and consolidation chemotherapy was used (according to the PALG ALL-6 regiment). RESULTS: During consolidation cycles, darbepoietin alfa, intravenous iron, and total parenteral nutrition was administered.

The application was initially tested by healthcare providers, and their comments and suggestions were used to develop an updated version. This version was tested by parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Comments and nonverbal expressions of parents were recorded during a 2-week pilot test. The qualitative study was followed by a quantitative study using audit log data from the administration portal to understand how parents use the application. Six healthcare providers and 15 parents participated. Parents gained a greater knowledge of leukemia, confidence in caregiving, social support, and information on how to reduce stress.

Abl's SH3, SH2, and tyrosine kinase domains are joined via a linker to an F-actin-binding domain (FABD). Research on Abl's roles in cell culture led to several hypotheses for its mechanism of action: 1) Abl phosphorylates other proteins, modulating their activity, 2) Abl directly regulates the cytoskeleton via its cytoskeletal interaction domains, and/or 3) Abl is a scaffold for a signaling complex. The importance of these roles during normal development remains untested. We tested these mechanistic hypotheses during Drosophila morphogenesis using a series of mutants to examine Abl's many cell biological roles. Strikingly, Abl lacking the FABD fully rescued morphogenesis, cell shape change, actin regulation, and viability, whereas kinase-dead Abl, although reduced in function, retained substantial rescuing ability in some but not all Abl functions. We also tested the function of four conserved motifs in the linker region, revealing a key role for a conserved PXXP motif known to bind Crk and Abi. We propose that Abl acts as a robust multidomain scaffold with different protein motifs and activities contributing differentially to diverse cellular behaviors.","['(c) 2016 Rogers et al.

Among the latter a complex interplay with the immune system is established by the clone. Next to a proposed recruitment of support from T and myeloid cells, potential anti-CLL immune reactions need to be subverted. By using TCL1 mice as a CLL model, we show that TCR-Vbeta7+ NK1.1+ T cells are overrepresented in this disease model and constitute a main subset of peripheral CD3+ cells with biased TCR usage, showing that these cells account for a major part for T cell skewing in TCL1 mice. Moreover, we show that overrepresentation is dependent on CD1d expression in TCL1 mice, implicating that these cells belong to a NKT-like cell fraction which are restricted to antigen presented by the MHC-like surface marker CD1d. Accordingly, we observed a high fraction of CD161+ cells within overrepresented T cells in CLL patients and we found downregulation of CD1d on the surface of CLL cells, both in TCL1 mice and patients. Finally, we show that in TCL1 mice, CD1d deficiency resulted in shortened overall survival.

Smac mimetics that antagonize Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) proteins have so far largely been investigated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines; however, little is yet known on the therapeutic potential of Smac mimetics in primary AML samples. In this study, we therefore investigated the antileukemic activity of the Smac mimetic BV6 in diagnostic samples of 67 adult AML patients and correlated the response to clinical, cytogenetic and molecular markers and gene expression profiles. Treatment with cytarabine (ara-C) was used as a standard chemotherapeutic agent. Interestingly, about half (51%) of primary AML samples are sensitive to BV6 and 21% intermediate responsive, while 28% are resistant. Notably, 69% of ara-C-resistant samples show a good to fair response to BV6. Furthermore, combination treatment with ara-C and BV6 exerts additive effects in most samples. Whole-genome gene expression profiling identifies cell death, TNFR1 and NF-kappaB signaling among the top pathways that are activated by BV6 in BV6-sensitive, but not in BV6-resistant cases. Furthermore, sensitivity of primary AML blasts to BV6 correlates with significantly elevated expression levels of TNF and lower levels of XIAP in diagnostic samples, as well as with NPM1 mutation. In a large set of primary AML samples, these data provide novel insights into factors regulating Smac mimetic response in AML and have important implications for the development of Smac mimetic-based therapies and related diagnostics in AML.",,"['Lueck, Sonja C', 'Russ, Annika C', 'Botzenhardt, Ursula', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Zobel, Kerry', 'Deshayes, Kurt', 'Vucic, Domagoj', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Fulda, Simone', 'Bullinger, Lars']","['Lueck SC', 'Russ AC', 'Botzenhardt U', 'Schlenk RF', 'Zobel K', 'Deshayes K', 'Vucic D', 'Dohner H', 'Dohner K', 'Fulda S', 'Bullinger L']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Early Discovery Biochemistry, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Early Discovery Biochemistry, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Early Discovery Biochemistry, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (DIABLO protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor, Type I/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC5226527,2016/07/08 06:00,2018/02/24 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/24 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10390 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10390 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 2;7(31):49539-49551. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10390.,['NOTNLM'],"['IAP proteins', 'acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'apoptosis', 'gene expression profiling (GEP)', 'smac mimetic']",,"['K.

We previously showed that lysine deacetylase sirtuin 1, SIRT1, promotes acquisition of BCR-ABL mutations in association with enhancing KU70 mediated non-homologous end joining DNA repair. In this study, we demonstrate that lysine specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) plays an opposite role to SIRT1 in regulating DNA repair and mutation acquisition. In response to therapeutic stress and DNA damage, LSD1 and SIRT1 compete for binding to KU70 on DNA damage foci globally and on the ABL locus. The recruitment of SIRT1 or LSD1 to KU70 impacts chromatin structure but does not correlate well with their direct histone modification functions, and SIRT1 helps maintain histone H4K16 acetylation and open chromatin for repair. The competitive KU70 binding by these proteins affects cancer cells' ability to repair broken DNA and acquire resistant genetic mutations in CML and prostate cancer cells. We identify that the core domain of KU70 binds both LSD1 and SIRT1, forming a molecular basis for the competition. The C-terminal SAP motif of KU70 mediates LSD1/SIRT1 competitive interaction by suppressing LSD1 binding to KU70 and ectopic expression of SAP-deleted KU70 to CML cells compromises their ability to acquire BCR-ABL mutations. Our study reveals a novel cellular stress response mechanism in cancer cells and a key role of LSD1/SIRT1/KU70 dynamic interaction in regulating DNA repair and mutation acquisition.",,"['Roth, Mendel', 'Wang, Zhiqiang', 'Chen, Wen Yong']","['Roth M', 'Wang Z', 'Chen WY']",,"['Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA033572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (KDM1A protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA End-Joining Repair', '*DNA Repair', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone Demethylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ku Autoantigen/*metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Domains', 'Sirtuin 1/*metabolism']",PMC5226577,2016/07/08 06:00,2018/02/23 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2015/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10328 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10328 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Aug 2;7(31):50195-50214. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10328.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'NHEJ', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'lysine deacetylase', 'lysine demethylase']",,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest associated with this publication.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that acquisition of TET2 mutations in blood cells does not per se cause cancers; however, TET2 mutations are likely to be acquired at the common myeloid/lymphoid progenitor levels.

A virus highly similar to GALV has been identified in an Australian native rodent (Melomys burtoni) after extensive screening of Australian wildlife. GALV-like viruses have also been discovered in several Southeast Asian species, although screening has not been extensive and viruses discovered to date are only distantly related to GALV. We therefore screened 26 Southeast Asian rodent species for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences, using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, in the attempt to identify potential GALV and KoRV hosts. Only the individuals belonging to a newly discovered subspecies of Melomys burtoni from Indonesia were positive, yielding an endogenous provirus very closely related to a strain of GALV. The sequence of the critical receptor domain for GALV infection in the Indonesian M. burtoni subsp. was consistent with the susceptibility of the species to GALV infection. The second record of a GALV in M. burtoni provides further evidence that M. burtoni, and potentially other lineages within the widespread subfamily Murinae, may play a role in the spread of GALV-like viruses. The discovery of a GALV in the most western part of the Australo-Papuan distribution of M. burtoni, specifically in a transitional zone between Asia and Australia (Wallacea), may be relevant to the cross-species transmission to gibbons in Southeast Asia and broadens the known distribution of GALVs in wild rodents. IMPORTANCE: Gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) and the koala retrovirus (KoRV) are very closely related, yet their hosts neither are closely related nor overlap geographically. Direct cross-species infection between koalas and gibbons is unlikely. Therefore, GALV and KoRV may have arisen via a cross-species transfer from an intermediate host whose range overlaps those of both gibbons and koalas. Using hybridization capture and high-throughput sequencing, we have screened a wide range of rodent candidate hosts from Southeast Asia for KoRV- and GALV-like sequences. Only a Melomys burtoni subspecies from Wallacea (Indonesia) was positive for GALV. We report the genome sequence of this newly identified GALV, the critical domain for infection of its potential cellular receptor, and its phylogenetic relationships with the other previously characterized GALVs. We hypothesize that Melomys burtoni, and potentially related lineages with an Australo-Papuan distribution, may have played a key role in cross-species transmission to other taxa.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Currently, the most widely used methods for the detection of minute residual malignant cells in the bone marrow and/or peripheral blood, minimal residual disease (MRD), are PCR and flow cytometry (FCM). Immunophenotypic modulation (IM) is a well known factor that can hamper the accurate FCM analysis. AIM: To report the IM detected by 8-color FCM during the BFM-type remission induction in 24 consecutive MRD-positive samples of children with B-cell precursor ALL and the possible implications for MRD detection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2010 and 2012 we prospectively followed up the MRD on days 15 and 33 of induction treatment in bone marrow (BM) samples and on day 8 in peripheral blood (PB). The IM was assessed by comparative analyses of the changes in the mean fluorescence intensity of 7 highly relevant antigens expressed by the leukemic cells and normal B-lymphocytes. RESULTS: IM occurred, to different extents, in all analyzed day 15 BM and in most day 33 BM samples. Statistically significant changes in the MFI-levels of four CDs expressed by the leukemic blasts were observed: downmodulation of CD10, CD19 and CD34 and upmodulation of CD20. No changes in the expression of CD38, CD58 and CD45 were noticed. CONCLUSIONS: Measuring the MRD by standardized 8-color flow cytometry helps improve the monitoring of the disease, leading to better therapeutic results. However, the IM of the different antigens expressed by the leukemic blasts should be taken into consideration and cautiously analyzed.",,"['Burnusuzov, Hasan A', 'Spasova, Mariya I', 'Murdjeva, Mariana A', 'Stoyanova, Angelina A', 'Mumdziev, Ivan N', 'Kaleva, Valeriya I', 'Belcheva, Milena I', 'Bosheva, Miroslava N']","['Burnusuzov HA', 'Spasova MI', 'Murdjeva MA', 'Stoyanova AA', 'Mumdziev IN', 'Kaleva VI', 'Belcheva MI', 'Bosheva MN']",,"['Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Varna, Varna, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Varna, Varna, Bulgaria', 'Department of Pediatrics and Medical Genetics, Medical University of Plovdiv, Plovdiv, Bulgaria']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Bulgaria,Folia Med (Plovdiv),Folia medica,2984761R,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/immunology', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology', 'CD58 Antigens/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Neprilysin/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/immunology', 'Prospective Studies']",,2016/07/08 06:00,2017/01/04 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2016/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1515/folmed-2016-0004 [doi]', '/j/folmed.2016.58.issue-1/folmed-2016-0004/folmed-2016-0004.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Folia Med (Plovdiv). 2016 Mar 1;58(1):28-35. doi: 10.1515/folmed-2016-0004.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some workers were also exposed to internal contamination by radionuclides. This study aims to assess the potential for bias due to confounding by internal contamination of estimates of associations between external radiation exposure and cancer mortality. METHODS: A cohort of 59,004 workers employed for at least 1 year between 1950 and 1994 by CEA (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique), AREVA NC, or EDF (Electricite de France) and badge-monitored for external radiation exposure were followed through 2004 to assess vital status and cause of death. A flag based on a workstation-exposure matrix defined four levels of potential for internal contamination. Standardized mortality ratios were assessed for each level of the internal contamination indicator. Poisson regression was used to quantify associations between external radiation exposure and cancer mortality, adjusting for potential internal contamination. RESULTS: For solid cancer, the mortality deficit tended to decrease as the levels of potential for internal contamination increased. For solid cancer and leukemia excluding chronic lymphocytic leukemia, adjusting the dose-response analysis on the internal contamination indicator did not markedly change the excess relative risk per Sievert of external radiation dose. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in this cohort, neglecting information on internal dosimetry while studying the association between external dose and cancer mortality does not generate a substantial bias. To investigate more specifically the health effects of internal contamination, an effort is underway to estimate organ doses due to internal contamination.",,"['Fournier, L', 'Laurent, O', 'Samson, E', 'Caer-Lorho, S', 'Laroche, P', 'Le Guen, B', 'Laurier, D', 'Leuraud, K']","['Fournier L', 'Laurent O', 'Samson E', 'Caer-Lorho S', 'Laroche P', 'Le Guen B', 'Laurier D', 'Leuraud K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9414-9249'],"['Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France. lucie.fournier@irsn.fr.', 'Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France.', 'Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France.', 'Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France.', 'AREVA, Paris, France.', 'EDF, Saint Denis, France.', 'Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France.', 'Ionizing Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, Institute for Radiological Protection and Nuclear Safety, 31 Avenue de la Division Leclerc, BP 17, 92262, Fontenay aux Roses Cedex, France.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160706,Germany,Int Arch Occup Environ Health,International archives of occupational and environmental health,7512134,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'France', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/*mortality', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Occupational Diseases/etiology/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Radiation Exposure/adverse effects/*analysis', 'Radiometry/methods', 'Regression Analysis']",,2016/07/08 06:00,2017/07/19 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2015/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/19 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00420-016-1152-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00420-016-1152-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int Arch Occup Environ Health. 2016 Nov;89(8):1183-1191. doi: 10.1007/s00420-016-1152-4.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear, as numbers of gastrulating cells are very limited. In the mouse embryo at embryonic day 6.5, cells located at the junction between the extra-embryonic region and the epiblast on the posterior side of the embryo undergo an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and ingress through the primitive streak. Subsequently, cells migrate, either surrounding the prospective ectoderm contributing to the embryo proper, or into the extra-embryonic region to form the yolk sac, umbilical cord and placenta. Fate mapping has shown that mature tissues such as blood and heart originate from specific regions of the pre-gastrula epiblast, but the plasticity of cells within the embryo and the function of key cell-type-specific transcription factors remain unclear. Here we analyse 1,205 cells from the epiblast and nascent Flk1(+) mesoderm of gastrulating mouse embryos using single-cell RNA sequencing, representing the first transcriptome-wide in vivo view of early mesoderm formation during mammalian gastrulation. Additionally, using knockout mice, we study the function of Tal1, a key haematopoietic transcription factor, and demonstrate, contrary to previous studies performed using retrospective assays, that Tal1 knockout does not immediately bias precursor cells towards a cardiac fate.",,"['Scialdone, Antonio', 'Tanaka, Yosuke', 'Jawaid, Wajid', 'Moignard, Victoria', 'Wilson, Nicola K', 'Macaulay, Iain C', 'Marioni, John C', 'Gottgens, Berthold']","['Scialdone A', 'Tanaka Y', 'Jawaid W', 'Moignard V', 'Wilson NK', 'Macaulay IC', 'Marioni JC', 'Gottgens B']",,"['EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'EMBL-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), Wellcome Trust Genome Campus, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, UK.', 'CRUK Cambridge Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['105031REIK/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '105031/D/14/Z/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '12765/CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', '12029/LLR_/Blood Cancer UK/United Kingdom', 'MR/M008975/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', '100140/WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/I00050X/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160706,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/deficiency', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Gastrula/cytology/metabolism', 'Gastrulation/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Mesoderm/*cytology/*embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*Single-Cell Analysis', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transcriptome/*genetics']",PMC4947525,2016/07/08 06:00,2016/08/16 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1038/nature18633 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 2016 Jul 14;535(7611):289-293. doi: 10.1038/nature18633.

ATLL, especially its aggressive form, is known for its poor prognosis, even with intensive chemotherapy. ATLL cells are considered to be monoclonal; however, multiclonal proliferation or emergence of a new clone over time has been reported based on Southern blot analysis, although direct molecular evidence remains elusive. Furthermore, it is thought that clonal change may be a cause of early drug resistance in ATLL. To directly analyze potential clonal changes in ATLL during its clinical course, we used inverse PCR to detect integration sites in combination with a newly developed method using next-generation sequencing, and compared ATLL cell clonality at different time points. The results of inverse PCR indicated that the major clone was altered in three of 19 patients.

Nevertheless, its poor solubility has been an obstacle to its bioavailability, requiring high-dose administration over a long period. We investigated whether crushing realgar crystals to the nanoscale and encapsulating the particles in a water-soluble polymer in one step using hot-melt extrusion would increase the bioavailability of As4S4. Raw As4S4 (r-As4S4) and water-soluble polymer were processed via co-rotating twin screw extrusion. The resulting product (e-As4S4) was characterized by SEM, XRD, and DLS. The cytotoxicity and therapeutic effects of e-As4S4 were evaluated in vivo and in vitro. The results show that e-As4S4 dissolved rapidly in water, forming a stable colloid solution. The average size of e-As4S4 particles was 680 nm, which was reduced by more than 40-fold compared with that of r-As4S4. The bioavailability of e-As4S4 was up to 12.6-fold higher than that of r-As4S4, and it inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells much more effectively than did r-As4S4, inducing apoptosis and significantly reducing the infiltration of HL-60 cells into the bone marrow, spleen, and liver.

In the presence of WT PML, PER2 co-localized with BMAL1 in the nucleus. In Pml(-/-) MEF transfected with mutant K487R PML, we observed that BMAL1 and PER2 co-localized with K487R PML in the cytosol. Furthermore, cytosolic CLOCK and PER2 displayed a significant non-overlapping IF staining pattern. In Bmal1(-/-) MEF, CLOCK was primarily cytosolic while PML and PER2 were nuclear.

The current study was designed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo relationships between the expression levels of SORCIN: in tumor cell lines and children with ALL; its possible correlation with MDR1/P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a multidrug resistance-related gene; and response to therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Childhood T-lymphoblastic leukemia (CCRF-CEM) cell lines resistant to methotrexate (MTX) were developed. Patient studies were performed by including 30 children with ALL at diagnosis, 3 children with bone marrow relapse, and 15 children with no symptoms of cancer. The mRNA expression profiles of SORCIN and MDR1/P-gp was assessed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Minimal residual disease (MRD) was measured in the patient population, a year following the initial therapy using qPCR. RESULTS: Cell line data analyses showed a positive correlation between SORCIN mRNA levels and resistance to MTX. The difference between patient and control groups for SORCIN expression levels was not significant. However, patients with a negative response to therapy showed an increase in SORCIN mRNA levels (up to 6.8-fold) compared with those with negative MRD. In addition, the results demonstrated a significant positive correlation between SORCIN and MDR1/P-gp gene expression levels. CONCLUSION: The current study introduces, for the first time, a possible prognostic value of SORCIN in childhood ALL, which may be correlated with MDR1/P-gp gene expression in these patients.",,"['Dabaghi, Mohammad', 'Rahgozar, Soheila', 'Moshtaghian, Jamal', 'Moafi, Alireza', 'Abedi, Marjan', 'Pourabutaleb, Elnaz']","['Dabaghi M', 'Rahgozar S', 'Moshtaghian J', 'Moafi A', 'Abedi M', 'Pourabutaleb E']",,"['1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan , Isfahan, Iran .', '1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan , Isfahan, Iran .', '1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan , Isfahan, Iran .', '2 Department of Pediatric-Hematology-Oncology, Sayed-ol-Shohada Hospital, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences , Isfahan, Iran .', '1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan , Isfahan, Iran .', '1 Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Isfahan , Isfahan, Iran .']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160706,United States,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers,Genetic testing and molecular biomarkers,101494210,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Biomarkers, Pharmacological)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SRI protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Biomarkers, Pharmacological/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",,2016/07/08 06:00,2017/04/05 06:00,['2016/07/08 06:00'],"['2016/07/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/gtmb.2016.0031 [doi]'],ppublish,Genet Test Mol Biomarkers. 2016 Sep;20(9):516-21. doi: 10.1089/gtmb.2016.0031.

The epigenetic drug, decitabine (DAC), represents one of the most promising therapeutic agents in cancers particularly in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, its ambiguous anti-tumor mechanism and the unpredictable drug-resistant nature in some population compromise its application in cancer therapy. In crosstalk with DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) are the key players in modulating the downstream epigenetic status of tumor suppressor genes. This study targets the role of decitabine in epigenetic regulation in leukemia therapy and searches responsive predictors and therapeutic targets for pretreatment evaluation and drug development. RESULTS: A simple, fast, and robust proteomic strategy identified 15 novel PTMs and 60 PTM combinations in two leukemia cell lines (MDS-L and TF-1). Histone modification profiles have been generated and compared between DAC sensitive and resistant groups (n = 3) in response to DAC treatment. Among these histone PTMs, five of which were found differentially upon DAC treatment in drug sensitive and resistant cells: H3.3K36me3, H4K8acK12acK16ac in MDS-L cells; and H3.1K27me1, H3.1K36me1, H3.1K27me1K36me1 in TF-1 cells. They may serve as biomarkers in predicting leukemia and drug responsiveness. In addition, we also explored PTM differences in two cell lines which were developed from early and advanced stages of AML. Three PTMs (H3.1K27me3, H3.1K27me2K36me2 and H3.3K27me2K36me2) are highly abundant in TF-1 cells (advanced AML cell line), suggesting their relevance to leukemogenesis. Our method allowed deep analysis of histone proteins and elucidation of a large number of histone PTMs with high precision and sensitivity. CONCLUSION: DAC-induced DNA hypomethylation has wide impact on chromatin modifications. This study represents first effort to investigate the undefined epigenetic mechanism of decitabine in leukemia therapy. The identification of 15 novel PTMs and the discovery of several marks have relevance to epigenetic directed therapies.",,"['Zhang, Chunchao', 'Suo, Jinfeng', 'Katayama, Hiroyuki', 'Wei, Yue', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Hanash, Samir']","['Zhang C', 'Suo J', 'Katayama H', 'Wei Y', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Hanash S']",,"['Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Unit 428, Houston, TX 77030 USA.', 'Clinical Cancer Prevention, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 6767 Bertner Ave, Houston, TX 77030 USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160705,England,Clin Proteomics,Clinical proteomics,101184586,,,,PMC4932764,2016/07/07 06:00,2016/07/07 06:01,['2016/07/07 06:00'],"['2016/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12014-016-9115-z [doi]', '9115 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Proteomics. 2016 Jul 5;13:14. doi: 10.1186/s12014-016-9115-z. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'Decitabine (DAC)', 'Histone modifications', 'Leukemia', 'Mass spectrometry', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Between 2004 and 2014, 44 patients with refractory AML and 36 patients with MDS were treated with new priming regimens (CHAG, CHTG, CHMG, or CTMG), and 77 patients with refractory AML and 52 patients with MDS were treated with conventional priming regimens (CHG or CAG). This was a single-center retrospective analysis of remission, adverse event, mortality, and survival. The capacity of clinical features (including the expression of co-stimulatory molecule B7.1 on tumor cells) to influence survival was assessed by multivariate Cox regression. RESULTS: Complete and partial remission rates (RRs) were significantly higher in AML patients treated with new regimens compared to conventional ones (68.2% vs 13.6%, P<0.05). Complete and partial remission were also significantly higher in patients with MDS treated with new regimens (55.6% vs 19.4%, P<0.05). However, although survival advantages were observed in the first year, the new regimens did not significantly improve 3-year overall survival (P>0.05). Patients administered the new regimens experienced more severe and sustained myelosuppression (P<0.05), but no severe adverse events or treatment-related deaths were observed. The rate of non-hematological side effects did not differ significantly between treatment regimens (P>0.05). Both RR and B7.1 expression were significantly higher in patients with AML-M2 and M5 (P<0.05).

Its multifunctional role in immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, viral, bacterial infection etc. has crossed its boundary of its potential of protecting cardiovascular system and lowering cardiovascular disease risk, attributing HDL to be known as a protective fat removal particle. Its structural homology with prostacyclin stabilization factor has contributed to its anti-clotting and anti-aggregatory effect on platelet which has potentiated its cardio-protective role as well as its therapeutic efficacy against Alzheimer's disease. The binding affinity and neutralising action against endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, reduces the toxic manifestations of septic shock. As a negative acute phase protein, it blocks T-cell signalling of macrophages. However the recently identified anti-tumor activity of apo A-I has been highlighted in various models of melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoblastic leukaemia, gastric as well as pancreatic cancers. These cancer fighting effects are directed towards regression of tumor size and distant metastasis by its immuno modulatory activity as well as its clearing effect on serum lysophospholipids. This lowering effect on lysophospholipid concentration is utilized by apo A-I mimetic peptides to be used in retarding tumor cell proliferation and as a potential cancer therapeutic agent. Not only that, it inhibits the tumor associated neo-angiogenesis as well as brings down the matrix degrading enzymes associated with tumor metastasis. However this efficient therapeutic potential of apo A-I as an anti tumor agent awaits further future experimental studies in humans.",,"['Mangaraj, Manaswini', 'Nanda, Rachita', 'Panda, Suchismita']","['Mangaraj M', 'Nanda R', 'Panda S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6808-6176'],"['Department of Biochemistry, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, Odisha India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, AIIMS, Raipur, Chhattisgarh 492099 India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, SCB Medical College, Cuttack, Odisha India.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150716,India,Indian J Clin Biochem,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,8708303,,,,PMC4910842,2016/07/07 06:00,2016/07/07 06:01,['2016/07/07 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12291-015-0513-1 [doi]', '513 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Clin Biochem. 2016 Jul;31(3):253-9. doi: 10.1007/s12291-015-0513-1.

This is considered from total nucleated cells (TNCs), unless there is erythroid-hyperplasia (erythroblasts >/= 50%), calculated from nonerythroid cells (NECs). In these instances, when BM blasts are >/= 20%, the disorder is classified as erythroleukemia, and when BM blasts are < 20%, as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In the latter, the percentage of blasts is considered from TNCs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We assessed the percentage of BM blasts from TNCs and NECs in 3,692 patients with MDS from the Grupo Espanol de Sindromes Mielodisplasicos, 465 patients with erythroid hyperplasia (MDS-E) and 3,227 patients without erythroid hyperplasia. We evaluated the relevance of both quantifications on classification and prognostication. RESULTS: By enumerating blasts systematically from NECs, 22% of patients with MDS-E and 12% with MDS from the whole series diagnosed within WHO categories with < 5% BM blasts, were reclassified into higher-risk categories and showed a poorer overall survival than did those who remained in initial categories (P = .006 and P = .001, respectively). Following WHO recommendations, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB)-2 diagnosis is not possible in MDS-E, as patients with 10% to < 20% BM blasts from TNCs fulfill erythroleukemia criteria; however, by considering blasts from NECs, 72 patients were recoded as RAEB-2 and showed an inferior overall survival than did patients with RAEB-1 without erythroid hyperplasia. Recalculating the International Prognostic Scoring System by enumerating blasts from NECs in MDS-E and in the overall MDS population reclassified approximately 9% of lower-risk patients into higher-risk categories, which indicated the survival expected for higher-risk patients. CONCLUSION: Regardless of the presence of erythroid hyperplasia, calculating the percentage of BM blasts from NECs improves prognostic assessment of MDS. This fact should be considered in future WHO classification reviews.",['(c) 2016 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],"['Arenillas, Leonor', 'Calvo, Xavier', 'Luno, Elisa', 'Senent, Leonor', 'Alonso, Esther', 'Ramos, Fernando', 'Ardanaz, Maria Teresa', 'Pedro, Carme', 'Tormo, Mar', 'Marco, Victor', 'Montoro, Julia', 'Diez-Campelo, Maria', 'Brunet, Salut', 'Arrizabalaga, Beatriz', 'Xicoy, Blanca', 'Andreu, Rafael', 'Bonanad, Santiago', 'Jerez, Andres', 'Nomdedeu, Benet', 'Ferrer, Ana', 'Sanz, Guillermo F', 'Florensa, Lourdes']","['Arenillas L', 'Calvo X', 'Luno E', 'Senent L', 'Alonso E', 'Ramos F', 'Ardanaz MT', 'Pedro C', 'Tormo M', 'Marco V', 'Montoro J', 'Diez-Campelo M', 'Brunet S', 'Arrizabalaga B', 'Xicoy B', 'Andreu R', 'Bonanad S', 'Jerez A', 'Nomdedeu B', 'Ferrer A', 'Sanz GF', 'Florensa L']",,"[""Leonor Arenillas, Xavier Calvo, Carme Pedro, Ana Ferrer, and Lourdes Florensa, Hospital del Mar Research Institute; Esther Alonso, Hospital Universitario Bellvitge Hospitalet de Llobregat; Julia Montoro, Hospital Universitario Vall d' Hebron; Salut Brunet, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau; Benet Nomdedeu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona; Elisa Luno, Hospital Universitario Central Asturias, Oviedo; Leonor Senent and Guillermo F.

After translocation through a type IV secretion system into epithelial cells, CagA is tyrosine phosphorylated by kinases of the Src and Abl families, leading to drastic cell elongation and motility. While the functional role of CagA in epithelial cells is well investigated, knowledge about CagA phosphorylation and its associated signal transduction pathways in B cells is only marginal. Here, we established the B cell line MEC1 derived from a B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) patient as a new infection model to study the signal transduction in B cells controlled by H. pylori We observed that CagA was rapidly injected, strongly tyrosine phosphorylated, and cleaved into a 100-kDa N-terminal and a 40-kDa C-terminal fragment. To identify upstream signal transduction pathways of CagA phosphorylation in MEC1 cells, pharmacological inhibitors were employed to specifically target Src and Abl kinases. We observed that CagA phosphorylation was strongly inhibited upon treatment with an Src inhibitor and slightly diminished when the Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) was applied. The addition of dasatinib to block c-Abl and Src kinases led to a complete loss of CagA phosphorylation. In conclusion, these results demonstrate an important role for Src and Abl tyrosine kinases in CagA phosphorylation in B cells, which represent druggable targets in H. pylori-mediated gastric MALT lymphoma.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Krisch et al.'],"['Krisch, Linda M', 'Posselt, Gernot', 'Hammerl, Peter', 'Wessler, Silja']","['Krisch LM', 'Posselt G', 'Hammerl P', 'Wessler S']",,"['Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Department of Molecular Biology, Division of Microbiology, Paris-Lodron University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Department of Molecular Biology, Division of Microbiology, Paris-Lodron University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Division of Allergy and Immunology, Paris-Lodron University, Salzburg, Austria.', 'Cancer Cluster Salzburg, Department of Molecular Biology, Division of Microbiology, Paris-Lodron University, Salzburg, Austria silja.wessler@sbg.ac.at.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160819,United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, Bacterial/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism/*microbiology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gastric Mucosa/microbiology', 'Helicobacter Infections/metabolism/microbiology', 'Helicobacter pylori/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism/microbiology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects/physiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",PMC4995908,2016/07/07 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/07/07 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['IAI.00349-16 [pii]', '10.1128/IAI.00349-16 [doi]']",epublish,Infect Immun. 2016 Aug 19;84(9):2671-80. doi: 10.1128/IAI.00349-16.

Various strategies have been developed to circumvent the shortcomings of platinum-based chemotherapy but the inherent problem remains unsolved. Here we report that platinum pyrithione (PtPT), a chemically well-characterized synthetic complex of platinum, inhibits proteasome function and thereby exhibits greater and more selective cytotoxicity to multiple cancer cells than cisplatin, without showing discernible DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, unlike the classical proteasome inhibitor bortezomib/Velcade which inhibits the proteasome via blocking the peptidase activity of 20S proteasomes, PtPT primarily deactivates 26S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases USP14 and UCHL5. Furthermore, PtPT can selectively induce cytotoxicity and proteasome inhibition in cancer cells from leukemia patients but not peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy humans. In nude mice, PtPT also remarkably inhibited tumor xenograft growth, without showing the adverse effects that were induced by cisplatin. Hence, we have discovered a new platinum-based anti-tumor agent PtPT which targets 26S proteasome-associated deubiquitinases rather than DNA in the cell and thereby exerts safer and more potent anti-tumor effects, identifying a highly translatable new platinum-based anti-cancer strategy.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Most of these lncRNAs have not been previously detected, even in the closely related T-cell lineage. Comparison with lncRNAs previously described in human B cells identified 185 mouse lncRNAs that have human orthologs. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation-seq, we classified 20% of the lncRNAs as either enhancer-associated (eRNA) or promoter-associated RNAs. We identified 126 eRNAs whose expression closely correlated with the nearest coding gene, thereby indicating the likely location of numerous enhancers active in the B-cell lineage. Furthermore, using this catalog of newly discovered lncRNAs, we show that PAX5, a transcription factor required to specify the B-cell lineage, bound to and regulated the expression of 109 lncRNAs in pro-B and mature B cells and 184 lncRNAs in acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",['(c) 2016 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Brazao, Tiago F', 'Johnson, Jethro S', 'Muller, Jennifer', 'Heger, Andreas', 'Ponting, Chris P', 'Tybulewicz, Victor L J']","['Brazao TF', 'Johnson JS', 'Muller J', 'Heger A', 'Ponting CP', 'Tybulewicz VL']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0760-4873', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9155-054X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7720-0447', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0202-7816', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2439-0798']","['The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom;', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Computational Genomics Analysis and Training Centre, MRC Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Physiology Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom;', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Computational Genomics Analysis and Training Centre, MRC Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Physiology Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Computational Genomics Analysis and Training Centre, MRC Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Physiology Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom; and.', 'The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom; Imperial College, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12021/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'CRUK_/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160705,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC5000579,2016/07/07 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/07/07 06:00'],"['2015/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)34247-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-11-680843 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2016 Aug 18;128(7):e10-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-11-680843.

Relapse rates significantly correlate with persistent minimal residual disease (MRD). In MRD, favorable effector-target ratios prevail and thus this situation might be optimally suited for immunotherapy with antibodies recruiting immunological effector cells. We here report on the generation, preclinical characterization and first clinical application in B-lineage ALL of an Fc-optimized CD19 antibody. This third-generation antibody (4G7SDIE) mediated enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) against leukemic blasts with effector cells from healthy volunteers and B-lineage ALL patients. The antibody was produced in a university-owned production unit and was applied on a compassionate use basis to 14 pediatric patients with refractory and relapsed B-lineage ALL at the stage of MRD.

Poisson regression modelling was carried out for proximity areas of varying sizes. In addition, the hypothesis of a gradient in leukaemia incidence with increasing levels of surrogate exposures was explored by means of focused hypothesis tests and generalized additive models. For the surrogate exposures, three proxies were used, that is, residential proximity to the nuclear site, prevailing winds and simulated radioactive discharges, on the basis of mathematical dispersion modelling. No excess incidence of acute leukaemia was observed around the nuclear power plants of Doel or Tihange nor around the nuclear site of Fleurus, which is a major manufacturer of radioactive isotopes in Europe. Around the site of Mol-Dessel, however, two- to three-fold increased leukaemia incidence rates were found in children aged 0-14 years living in the 0-5, 0-10 and the 0-15 km proximity areas. For this site, there was evidence for a gradient in leukaemia incidence with increased proximity, prevailing winds and simulated radioactive discharges, suggesting a potential link with the site that needs further investigation. An increased incidence of acute leukaemia in children aged 0-14 years was observed around one nuclear site that hosted reprocessing activities in the past and where nuclear research activities and radioactive waste treatment are ongoing.",,"['Bollaerts, Kaatje', 'Simons, Koen', 'Van Bladel, Lodewijk', 'De Smedt, Tom', 'Sonck, Michel', 'Fierens, Sebastien', 'Poffijn, Andre', 'Geraets, David', 'Gosselin, Pol', 'Van Oyen, Herman', 'Francart, Julie', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse, An']","['Bollaerts K', 'Simons K', 'Van Bladel L', 'De Smedt T', 'Sonck M', 'Fierens S', 'Poffijn A', 'Geraets D', 'Gosselin P', 'Van Oyen H', 'Francart J', 'Van Nieuwenhuyse A']",,"['Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Federal Agency for Nuclear Control.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Federal Agency for Nuclear Control.', 'Department of Electronics and Informatics, Free University Brussels (VUB), ETRO, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Federal Agency for Nuclear Control.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.', 'Belgian Cancer Registry.', 'Scientific Institute of Public Health.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,England,Eur J Cancer Prev,European journal of cancer prevention : the official journal of the European Cancer Prevention Organisation (ECP),9300837,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Environmental Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', '*Nuclear Power Plants', 'Sex Factors', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*epidemiology']",PMC5802263,2016/07/06 06:00,2019/03/21 06:00,['2016/07/06 06:00'],"['2016/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000272 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Prev. 2018 Mar;27(2):184-191. doi: 10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000272.,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Cancer Prev. 2017 May;26(3):268.

Iron chelation therapy (ICT) thus plays an integral role in the management of these patients. Moreover, ICT has been shown to prolong leukemia-free survival in MDS patients; however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are unclear. Iron is a key molecule for regulating cytosolic aconitase 1 (ACO1). Additionally, the mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), the enzyme downstream of ACO1 in the TCA cycle, is associated with epigenetic abnormalities secondary to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) and DNA methylation. However, epigenetic abnormalities observed in many MDS patients occur without IDH mutation. We hypothesized that iron itself activates the ACO1-IDH pathway, which may increase 2-HG and DNA methylation, and eventually contribute to leukemogenesis without IDH mutation. Using whole RNA sequencing of bone marrow cells in iron-overloaded mice, we observed that the enzymes, phosphoglucomutase 1, glycogen debranching enzyme, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (Idh1), which are involved in glycogen and glucose metabolism, were increased. Digital PCR further showed that Idh1 and Aco1, enzymes involved in the TCA cycle, were also elevated. Additionally, enzymatic activities of TCA cycle and methylated DNA were increased. Iron chelation reversed these phenomena. In conclusion, iron activation of glucose metabolism causes an increase of 2-HG and DNA methylation.",,"['Yamamoto, Masayo', 'Tanaka, Hiroki', 'Toki, Yasumichi', 'Hatayama, Mayumi', 'Ito, Satoshi', 'Addo, Lynda', 'Shindo, Motohiro', 'Sasaki, Katsunori', 'Ikuta, Katsuya', 'Ohtake, Takaaki', 'Fujiya, Mikihiro', 'Torimoto, Yoshihiro', 'Kohgo, Yutaka']","['Yamamoto M', 'Tanaka H', 'Toki Y', 'Hatayama M', 'Ito S', 'Addo L', 'Shindo M', 'Sasaki K', 'Ikuta K', 'Ohtake T', 'Fujiya M', 'Torimoto Y', 'Kohgo Y']",,"['Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Immunology and Regenerative Medicine, Asahikawa Medical University, 2-1-1-1 Midorigaoka-Higashi, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, 078-8510, Japan. hiroki-t@asahikawa-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Legal Medicine, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan. hiroki-t@asahikawa-med.ac.jp.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Gastrointestinal Immunology and Regenerative Medicine, Asahikawa Medical University, 2-1-1-1 Midorigaoka-Higashi, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, 078-8510, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Nasu-shiobara, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology/Oncology, Asahikawa Medical University, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Oncology Center, Asahikawa Medical University Hospital, Asahikawa, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'International University of Health and Welfare Hospital, Nasu-shiobara, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160705,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Glutarates)', '2889-31-8 (alpha-hydroxyglutarate)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 4.2.1.3 (Iron Regulatory Protein 1)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Carcinogenesis/chemically induced', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glutarates/blood', 'Iron/*pharmacology', 'Iron Regulatory Protein 1/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mice']",,2016/07/06 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/07/06 06:00'],"['2016/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2016/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12185-016-2054-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-016-2054-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2016 Oct;104(4):491-501. doi: 10.1007/s12185-016-2054-7.

The objective of such research is often to identify the smallest possible set of genes that can still achieve good predictive performance. To do so, many of the recently proposed classification methods require some form of dimension-reduction of the problem which finally provide a single model as an output and, in most cases, rely on the likelihood function in order to achieve variable selection. We propose a new prediction-based objective function that can be tailored to the requirements of practitioners and can be used to assess and interpret a given problem. Based on cross-validation techniques and the idea of importance sampling, our proposal scans low-dimensional models under the assumption of sparsity and, for each of them, estimates their objective function to assess their predictive power in order to select. Two applications on cancer data sets and a simulation study show that the proposal compares favorably with competing alternatives such as, for example, Elastic Net and Support Vector Machine. Indeed, the proposed method not only selects smaller models for better, or at least comparable, classification errors but also provides a set of selected models instead of a single one, allowing to construct a network of possible models for a target prediction accuracy level.",,"['Guerrier, Stephane', 'Mili, Nabil', 'Molinari, Roberto', 'Orso, Samuel', 'Avella-Medina, Marco', 'Ma, Yanyuan']","['Guerrier S', 'Mili N', 'Molinari R', 'Orso S', 'Avella-Medina M', 'Ma Y']",,"['Department of Statistics, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Champaign, IL, USA.', 'Research Center for Statistics, Geneva School of Economics and Management, University of Geneva Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Research Center for Statistics, Geneva School of Economics and Management, University of Geneva Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Research Center for Statistics, Geneva School of Economics and Management, University of Geneva Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Research Center for Statistics, Geneva School of Economics and Management, University of Geneva Geneva, Switzerland.', 'Department of Statistics, University of South Carolina Columbia, SC, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160615,Switzerland,Front Genet,Frontiers in genetics,101560621,,,,PMC4908120,2016/07/06 06:00,2016/07/06 06:01,['2016/07/06 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fgene.2016.00097 [doi]'],epublish,Front Genet. 2016 Jun 15;7:97. doi: 10.3389/fgene.2016.00097. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'biomarker selection', 'breast cancer', 'disease classification', 'genomic networks', 'model averaging']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upregulated expression of MLF1IP was correlated with more often lymph node metastasis and negative progesterone receptor expression in TCGA cohorts. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high MLF1IP expression had significantly lower overall survival. Moreover, multivariate analysis revealed that high MLF1IP expression was independent high risk factor as well as old age (>60) and distant metastasis. This study provides new insights and evidences that MLF1IP over-expression plays important roles in progression of luminal breast cancer.

Dysregulation of hIMPDH expression and activity have been found in a variety of human cancers including leukemia. In this study, we found that myricetin, a naturally occurring phytochemical existed in berries, wine and tea, was a novel inhibitor of human type 1 and type 2 IMPDH (hIMPDH1/2) with IC50 values of 6.98 +/- 0.22 muM and 4.10 +/- 0.14 muM, respectively. Enzyme kinetic analysis using Lineweaver-Burk plot revealed that myricetin is a mix-type inhibitor for hIMPDH1/2. Differential scanning fluorimetry and molecular docking simulation data demonstrate that myricetin is capable of binding with hIMPDH1/2. Myricetin treatment exerts potent anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects on K562 human leukemia cells in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, cytotoxicity of myricetin on K562 cells were markedly attenuated by exogenous addition of guanosine, a salvage pathway of maintaining intracellular pool of guanine nucleotides. Taking together, these results indicate that natural product myricetin exhibits potent anti-leukemia activity by interfering with purine nucleotides biosynthetic pathway through the suppression of hIMPDH1/2 catalytic activity.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PR1-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes (PR1-CTLs) have activity against primary myeloid leukemia in vitro and in vivo and thus could have great potential in the setting of adoptive cellular therapy (ACT). Adult peripheral blood-derived PR1-CTLs are infrequent but preferentially lyse myeloid leukemia cells. We sought to examine PR1-CTLs in umbilical cord blood (UCB) because UCB units provide a rapidly available cell source and a lower risk of graft-versus-host disease, even in the setting of mismatched human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci. METHODS: We first determined the frequency of PR1-CTLs in HLA-A2(+) UCB units and then successfully expanded them ex vivo using repeated stimulation with PR1 peptide-pulsed antigen-presenting cells (APCs). After expansion, we assessed the PR1-CTL phenotype (naive, effector, memory) and function against PR1-expressing target cells. RESULTS: PR1-CTLs are detected at an average frequency of 0.14% within the CD8(+) population of fresh UCB units, which is 45 times higher than in healthy adult peripheral blood. UCB PR1-CTLs are phenotypically naive, consistent with the UCB CD8(+) population as a whole. In addition, the cells can be expanded by stimulation with PR1 peptide-pulsed APCs. Expansion results in an increased frequency of PR1-CTLs, up to 4.56%, with an average 20-fold increase in total number. After expansion, UCB PR1-CTLs express markers consistent with effector memory T cells. Expanded UCB PR1-CTLs are functional in vitro as they are able to produce cytokines and lyse PR1-expressing leukemia cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report to show that T cells specific for a leukemia-associated antigen are found at a significantly higher frequency in UCB than adult blood. Our results also demonstrate specific cytotoxicity of expanded UCB-derived PR1-CTLs against PR1-expressing targets. Together, our data suggest that UCB PR1-CTLs could be useful to prevent or treat leukemia relapse in myeloid leukemia patients.","['Copyright (c) 2016 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

It is difficult to recommend guidelines for the prevention or management of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity applicable to all cancer types. Therefore, anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity remains a major limitation in the proper management of cancer patients treated with an anthracycline-combined regimen. Efforts have been extensive to determine the mechanism and treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.

Forty-three patients were recruited of whom 37 were evaluable. Seventy-three per cent were aged >60 years. Over half of the patients received a fludarabine and cyclophosphamide-based regimen as prior CLL treatment. The overall response rate was 46% (complete response 27%, partial response 19%) at six cycles. The median progression-free survival was 6.2 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.9-14.0 months) and median OS was 11.4 months (95% CI 6.4-25.6 months). Treatment-naive and TP53-intact patients had improved outcomes. Fifteen episodes of neutropenic fever and 46 non-neutropenic infections were observed. There were no treatment-related deaths. Seven patients received platinum-containing salvage at progression, with only one patient obtaining an adequate response to proceed to allogeneic transplantation.

The use of nucleoside analogs such as fludarabine (Flu) in combination with i.v. busulfan (Bu) has been shown to be highly effective as a pretransplant conditioning regimen in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Because leukemia relapse remains the leading cause of death after allo-SCT, we studied whether clofarabine (Clo), a nucleoside analog with potent antileukemia activity, can be used to complement Flu. In a preliminary report, we previously showed the safety and efficacy of Clo +/- Flu with i.v. Bu in 51 patients with high-risk AML, CML, and MDS. The study has now been completed, and we present long-term follow-up data on the entire 70-patient population, which included 49 (70%), 8 (11%), and 13 (19%) patients with AML, MDS, and CML, respectively. Thirteen patients (19%) were in complete remission, and 41 patients (59%) received matched unrelated donor grafts. Engraftment was achieved in all patients. Sixty-three patients (90%) achieved complete remission. There were no deaths reported at day +30, and the 100-day nonrelapse mortality rate was 4% (n = 3). Thirty-one percent of patients (n = 22) developed grades II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease, and the median overall survival and progression-free survival times were 2.4 years and .9 years, respectively. Our results confirm the safety and overall and progression-free survival advantage of the arms with higher Clo doses and lower Flu doses, which was most prominent in the AML/MDS group.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

In B cell lymphoid malignancies, reduced-intensity regimens containing rituximab, an antiCD20 antibody, have been associated with favorable survival; however, the long-term outcomes of rituximab-containing versus nonrituximab-containing regimens for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in B cell lymphoid malignancies remain to be determined. We retrospectively analyzed 94 patients who received an allogeneic transplant for a B cell lymphoid malignancy. Of these, 33 received RIC with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor and mini-methotrexate, and 61 received RIC with fludarabine and busulfan (FluBu) and GVHD prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor and mycophenolate mofetil. The 2-year overall survival was superior in patients who received FCR versus FluBu (72.7% versus 54.1%, P = .031), and in multivariable analysis adjusted for Disease Risk Index and donor type, only the conditioning regimen (FluBu versus FCR: HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.04 to 4.08; P = .037) and Disease Risk Index (low versus intermediate/high: HR, .38; 95% CI, .17 to .86; P = .02) were independent predictors of overall survival. The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was lower in patients who received FCR versus FluBu (24.2% versus 51.7%, P = .01). There was no difference in rate of relapse/progression or acute GVHD. Our results demonstrate that the use of RIC with FCR and GVHD prophylaxis with a calcineurin inhibitor and mini-methotrexate is associated with decreased chronic GVHD and improved overall survival.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

To this end, we analyzed similarities and differences in the intrinsic disorder distribution of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins related to autophagy. We also looked at the peculiarities of the distribution of the intrinsically disordered autophagy-related proteins in various intra-nuclear organelles, such as the nucleolus, chromatin, Cajal bodies, nuclear speckles, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, nuclear lamina, nuclear pores, and perinucleolar compartment. This analysis revealed that the autophagy-related proteins constitute about 2.5% of the non-nuclear proteins and 3.3% of the nuclear proteins, which corresponds to a substantial enrichment by about 32% in the nucleus. Curiously, although, in general, the autophagy-related proteins share similar characteristics of disorder with a generic set of all non-nuclear proteins, chromatin and nuclear speckles are enriched in the intrinsically disordered autophagy proteins (29 and 37% of these proteins are disordered, respectively) and have high disorder content at 0.24 and 0.27, respectively.

By contrast, sustained global cytosolic Ca(2+) elevations decrease ATP levels and cause necrosis, leading to the disease acute pancreatitis (AP). Toxic Ca(2+) signals can be evoked by products of alcohol and fatty acids as well as bile acids. Here, we have investigated the mechanism by which l-asparaginase evokes AP. Asparaginase is an essential element in the successful treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the most common type of cancer affecting children, but AP is a side-effect occurring in about 5-10% of cases. Like other pancreatitis-inducing agents, asparaginase evoked intracellular Ca(2+) release followed by Ca(2+) entry and also substantially reduced Ca(2+) extrusion because of decreased intracellular ATP levels. The toxic Ca(2+) signals caused extensive necrosis. The asparaginase-induced pathology depended on protease-activated receptor 2 and its inhibition prevented the toxic Ca(2+) signals and necrosis. We tested the effects of inhibiting the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) entry by the Ca(2+) channel inhibitor GSK-7975A. This markedly reduced asparaginase-induced Ca(2+) entry and also protected effectively against the development of necrosis.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evolution brings Ca(2+) and ATP together to control life and death'.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.'],"['Peng, Shuang', 'Gerasimenko, Julia V', 'Tsugorka, Tatiana', 'Gryshchenko, Oleksiy', 'Samarasinghe, Sujith', 'Petersen, Ole H', 'Gerasimenko, Oleg V']","['Peng S', 'Gerasimenko JV', 'Tsugorka T', 'Gryshchenko O', 'Samarasinghe S', 'Petersen OH', 'Gerasimenko OV']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6998-0380'],"[""Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK Department of Pathophysiology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, People's Republic of China."", 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology, Kiev 01024, Ukraine.', 'Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, Great Ormond Street, London WC1N 3JH, UK.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK Systems Immunity Research Institute, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF14 4XN, Wales, UK petersenoh@cardiff.ac.uk.', 'Cardiff School of Biosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3AX, Wales, UK gerasimenkoov@cardiff.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['G19/22/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J002771/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Department of Health/United Kingdom']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,"Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

However, research spending on tobacco-related disease, and particularly smoking prevention, is thought to be low. We therefore aimed to assess the relation between tobacco-related research investment and disease burden from 2008 to 2012. METHODS: We used the Health Research Classification System to classify UK government and charitable research funding by broad health category and then by tobacco prevention research and 18 WHO defined tobacco-related diseases. We used UK mortality figures to calculate disease-specific tobacco attributable deaths and then compared disease specific and tobacco prevention research investment with all cause and tobacco attributable mortality over the 5-year period and as annual averages. RESULTS: 12 922 research grants were identified with a total value of pound6.69bn, an annual average of pound1.34bn. Annually an average of 110 000 people die from tobacco-related disease, approximately 20% of total deaths. pound130m is invested in researching tobacco-related disease each year and pound5m on tobacco prevention, 10.8% and 0.42% of total annual research funding, respectively. Prevention research equated to an annual average of pound46 per tobacco attributable death or one pound for every pound29 spent on tobacco-related disease. Funding varied widely for diseases with different numbers of deaths (eg, lung cancer pound68 per all cause death, cervical cancer pound2500), similar numbers of deaths (leukaemia pound983 per death, stomach cancer pound43) or similar numbers of tobacco attributable deaths (eg, colorectal cancer pound5k, pancreatic cancer pound670, bladder cancer pound340). CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco-related research funding is not related to burden of disease or level of risk. As a result certain diseases receive a disproportionately low level of research funding and disease prevention funding is even lower.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

In human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), current models suggest transformation creates leukemic stem cell (LSC) populations arrested at a progenitor-like stage expressing cell surface CD34. We show that in approximately 25% of AML, with a distinct genetic mutation pattern where >98% of cells are CD34(-), there are multiple, nonhierarchically arranged CD34(+) and CD34(-) LSC populations. Within CD34(-) and CD34(+) LSC-containing populations, LSC frequencies are similar; there are shared clonal structures and near-identical transcriptional signatures. CD34(-) LSCs have disordered global transcription profiles, but these profiles are enriched for transcriptional signatures of normal CD34(-) mature granulocyte-macrophage precursors, downstream of progenitors. But unlike mature precursors, LSCs express multiple normal stem cell transcriptional regulators previously implicated in LSC function. This suggests a new refined model of the relationship between LSCs and normal hemopoiesis in which the nature of genetic/epigenetic changes determines the disordered transcriptional program, resulting in LSC differentiation arrest at stages that are most like either progenitor or precursor stages of hemopoiesis.",['(c) 2016 Quek et al.'],"['Quek, Lynn', 'Otto, Georg W', 'Garnett, Catherine',

The most common causes of EMH are myelofibrosis, diffuse osseous metastatic disease replacing the bone marrow, leukaemia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia. The purpose of this article is to review the common and uncommon imaging appearances of EMH by anatomical compartment. In the thorax, EMH most commonly presents as paravertebral fat-containing masses, and typically does not present a diagnostic dilemma; however, EMH in the abdomen most commonly manifests as hepatosplenomegaly with or without focal soft-tissue masses in the liver, spleen, perirenal space, and in the peritoneum. Hepatosplenomegaly, a non-specific feature, most often occurs without an associated focal mass, which makes suggestion of EMH difficult. EMH manifesting as visceral soft-tissue masses often requires biopsy as the differential diagnosis can include lymphoma, metastatic disease, and sarcoma. Many of these soft-tissue masses do not contain adipose elements, making the diagnosis of EMH difficult. Clinical history is crucial, as EMH would likely not otherwise be in the differential in patients with non-specific abdominal masses. Careful biopsy planning is necessary when EMH is a diagnostic consideration, given the propensity for haemorrhage.

Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has been involved in the process and is a promising target for treating liver fibrosis. This study aimed to explore the effects of pentoxifylline (PTX) on liver fibrosis induced by schistosoma japonicum infection by inhibiting the HH signaling pathway. Phorbol12-myristate13-acetate (PMA) was used to induce human acute mononuclear leukemia cells THP-1 to differentiate into macrophages. The THP-1-derived macrophages were stimulated by soluble egg antigen (SEA), and the culture supernatants were collected for detection of activation of macrophages. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect the cytotoxicity of the culture supernatant and PTX on the LX-2 cells. The LX-2 cells were administered with activated culture supernatant from macrophages and(or) PTX to detect the transforming growth factor-beta gene expression. The mRNA expression of shh and gli-1, key parts in HH signaling pathway, was detected. The mRNA expression of shh and gli-1 was increased in LX-2 cells treated with activated macrophages-derived culture supernatant, suggesting HH signaling pathway may play a key role in the activation process of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The expression of these genes decreased in LX-2 cells co-cultured with both activated macrophages-derived culture supernatant and PTX, indicating PTX could suppress the activation process of HSCs. In conclusion, these data provide evidence that PTX prevents liver fibrogenesis in vitro by the suppression of HH signaling pathway.",,"['Li, Hui', 'Hua, Juan', 'Guo, Chun-Xia', 'Wang, Wei-Xian', 'Wang, Bao-Ju', 'Yang, Dong-Liang', 'Wei, Ping', 'Lu, Yin-Ping']","['Li H', 'Hua J', 'Guo CX', 'Wang WX', 'Wang BJ', 'Yang DL', 'Wei P', 'Lu YP']",,"['Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. pingw_2013@sina.cn.', 'Institute of Infection and Immunology, Department of Infectious Diseases, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. yinpinglu@163.com.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160705,China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

Based on these observations, we derived small-molecule inhibitors of the BRD9 bromodomain that selectively suppress the proliferation of mouse and human AML cell lines. To establish these effects as on-target, we engineered a bromodomain-swap allele of BRD9 that retains functionality despite a radically altered bromodomain pocket. Expression of this allele in AML cells confers resistance to the antiproliferative effects of our compound series, thus establishing BRD9 as the relevant cellular target. Furthermore, we used an analogous domain-swap strategy to generate an inhibitor-resistant allele of EZH2.

Moreover, in the multivariate analysis restricted to the group of patients with documented cytogenetic risk (n=36) CD26 expression, Rai clinical stage and cytogenetic profile remained their independent impact on TTT.

Unfortunately, this treatment is hampered by hypersensitivity reactions. In general, allergies - regardless of severity - cause complete inactivation of the drug. However, we report atypical allergic reactions without inactivation of asparaginase, here called allergic-like reactions. PROCEDURE: Patients with an allergic-like reaction, who were treated according to the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-11 or the CoALL 08-09 protocol, were described. The reactions were identified by continual measurement of asparaginase activity levels. Characteristics, including timing of occurrence, symptoms, grade, and the presence of antiasparaginase antibodies, were compared to those of real allergies. RESULTS: Fourteen allergic-like reactions occurred in nine patients. Five reactions were to PEGasparaginase and nine to Erwinia asparaginase. Allergic-like reactions occurred relatively late after the start of infusion compared to real allergies. Antibodies were absent in all but one patient with an allergic-like reaction, while they were detected in all patients with a real allergy. Symptoms and grade did not differ between the groups. Asparaginase was continued with the same formulation in six patients of whom four finished treatment with adequate activity levels. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, allergic-like reactions occur relatively late after the start of infusion and without antibodies. Despite these clinical differences, allergic-like reactions can only be distinguished from real allergies by continually measuring asparaginase activity levels. If clinically tolerated, formulations should not be switched in case of allergic-like reactions. Moreover, failure to recognize these reactions may lead to a less favorable prognosis if asparaginase therapy is terminated unnecessarily.","['(c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kloos, Robin Q H', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Escherich, Gabriele', 'van der Sluis, Inge M']","['Kloos RQ', 'Pieters R', 'Escherich G', 'van der Sluis IM']",,"[""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. r.kloos@erasmusmc.nl."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Clinic of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Centre Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160704,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Antibodies/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/immunology', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.26123 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2016 Nov;63(11):1928-34. doi: 10.1002/pbc.26123.

A total of 162 consecutive AML patients receiving intensified myeloablative unrelated CBT (n=107) or allogeneic PBSC transplantation (allo-PBSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from an HLA-identical sibling donor (n=55) were investigated. Neutrophil or platelet engraftment was slower in the CBT cohort compared with that in the allo-PBSCT/BMT cohort. The incidence of grade II-IV or grade III-IV acute GvHD (aGvHD) and transplant-related mortality (TRM) were not significantly different in the two cohorts. Compared with the allo-PBSCT/BMT cohort, the CBT cohort had a significantly lower rate of chronic GvHD (cGvHD) (13.7% vs 28.3%; P=0.047) or extensive cGvHD (9.9% vs 24.1%; hazard ratio (HR)=2.06, P=0.039). The incidence of relapse at 5 years in the CBT cohort was significantly lower than that in the allo-PBSCT/BMT cohort (15.3% vs 36.1%; HR=4.62, P=0.009). The probabilities of overall survival and leukemia-free survival were similar between the two cohorts. The adjusted 5-year probability of GRFS was higher after CBT than that after allo-PBSCT/BMT (55.4% vs 39.2%; HR=1.63, P=0.042). The present study suggests that, for AML patients, intensified myeloablative unrelated CBT is associated with less cGvHD and a lower risk of relapse. In addition, these patients do not experience excessive TRM or severe aGvHD that translates into better GRFS compared with those patients who undergo HLA-identical sibling allo-PBSCT/BMT; this observation may reflect the clinical separation between cGvHD and GvL within our CBT protocol.",,"['Zheng, C-C', 'Zhu, X-Y', 'Tang, B-L', 'Zhang, X-H', 'Zhang, L', 'Geng, L-Q', 'Liu, H-L', 'Sun, Z-M']","['Zheng CC', 'Zhu XY', 'Tang BL', 'Zhang XH', 'Zhang L', 'Geng LQ', 'Liu HL', 'Sun ZM']",,"['Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, China.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160704,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Allografts', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*mortality', '*Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', '*Unrelated Donors']",,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/12/15 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/15 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2016182 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2016.182 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2017 Jan;52(1):88-94. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2016.182.

In vitro, cells expressing FcgammaRIIIa-158V mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) more efficiently than cells expressing FcgammaRIIIa-158F. The impact of the FCGR2A-131HR polymorphism is unclear. In this study, the FCGR polymorphisms FCGR3A-158VF and FCGR2A-131HR were analyzed in pediatric patients with mature aggressive B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma/leukemia (B-NHL). Pediatric patients received a single dose of rituximab monotherapy. Response was evaluated on day 5 followed by standard chemotherapy for B-NHL. Among 105 evaluable patients, a response to rituximab was observed in 21 % of those homozygous for FcgammaRIIa-131RR (5/24) compared to 48 % of patients who were HH and HR FcgammaRIIa-131 allele carriers (18/34 and 21/47, respectively; p = 0.044). Among patients with the FCGR3A-158 polymorphism, those homozygous for the FF genotype had a significantly favorable rituximab response rate of 59 % (22/37) compared to 32 % in patients who were FcgammaRIIIa-158VV and FcgammaRIIIa-VF allele carriers (2/9 and 20/59, respectively; p = 0.022). A stringent phase II response evaluation of children and adolescents with B-NHL after one dose of rituximab monotherapy showed a significant association between the rituximab response rate and FCGR polymorphisms.

But the effect of CALR vs. JAK2V617F mutations on the clinical progression and prognosis of primary fibrosis (PMF) remains relatively obscure. In this meta-analysis, we searched Pubmed, Embase, and Web of Science databases for observational studies published until February 2016. Researches that evaluated CALR vs. JAK2V617F mutations on PMF-relevant complications (splenomegaly, leukemic transformation, or thrombosis) and overall survival were selected. Pooled adjust odds ratio (OR), hazard risk (HR), and the corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the CALR-mutant versus the JAK2-mutant categories. Twelve studies involving 435 CALR-mutated and 1116 JAK2V617F PMF patients were analyzed. CALR-mutated patients displayed a lower risk of splenomegaly (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.29-0.78) and thrombosis (OR 0.52, 95 % CI 0.29-0.92) but showed no significant difference in the risk of leukemic transformation (OR 0.90, 95 % CI 0.55-1.47) when compared with JAK2-mutated patients. CALR mutation favorably affected overall survival while JAK2 mutation led to poorer survival rate (HR 2.58, 95 % CI 2.08-3.20).

Cells were exposed to 18alpha-GA at various concentrations for various time periods and were harvested for flow cytometry total viable cell and apoptotic cell death measurements. Cells treated with 18alpha-GA significantly inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 value of 100 muM at 48 h. The cell growth inhibition resulted in induction of apoptosis and decreased the mitochondria membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and increased caspase-8, -9 and -3 activities. Furthermore, cytochrome c and AIF were released from mitochondria, as shown by western blotting and confirmed by confocal laser microscopy. Western blotting showed that 18alpha-GA increased the levels of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bid and decreased the anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl, furthermore, results also showed that 18alpha-GA increased Fas and Fas-L which are associated with surface death receptor in HL-60 cells.

It exhibits potent antitumour activity towards the P388 (murine leukaemia) cell line in vitro and is selectively sensitive towards certain non-small cell lung, melanoma, and breast cancer cell lines, however, the biological mode of action of pterocellin A is unknown. Using the human cervical cancer cell line HeLa, we show that pterocellin A exhibited cytotoxicity against HeLa cells with an IC50 of 886 ng/mL. Time-course MTT and LDH assays were carried out and the results showed only a low level of cytosolic LDH was detected in the supernatant after all the cells have died from pterocellin A treatment at 2000 ng/mL. This indicated the cells maintained membrane integrity upon cell death which suggested apoptotic cell death. Additionally, morphological changes were observed under the microscope after 6 h of treatment. Cell shrinkage and nucleus condensation were observed, as well as apparent membrane blebbing, a key feature of apoptosis. The MTT data was also indicative of mitochondria impairment which could suggest that pterocellin A targets the mitochondria. This idea was supported by the observed changes in the morphology and location of the mitochondria after exposure to pterocellin A. Furthermore, the level of activated caspase-3 in HeLa cells increased after treatment with pterocellin A; activated caspase-3 can only be detected after a series of signalling events following the induction of apoptosis.

To report the ocular findings in patients with hematopoietic malignancy with optic nerve involvement and abducens nerve palsy. Methods. The medical records of all cases of hematopoietic cancer with ophthalmic involvements seen in the Department of Ophthalmology of the National Center for Global Health and Medicine between 2009 and 2014 were reviewed. Results. Eight patients with hematopoietic cancer with optic nerve invasion or abducens nerve palsy were studied. The primary diseases were 3 cases of multiple myeloma, 1 case of acute lymphocytic leukemia, 1 case of follicular lymphoma, and 3 cases of AIDS-related lymphoma. Six cases had optic nerve invasion, 2 cases had abducens nerve palsy, and 1 case had optic nerve invasion of both eyes. The median visual acuity of eyes with optic nerve invasion was 0.885 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units. The final visual acuity of eyes with optic nerve invasion was 1.25 logMAR units, and that of those with sixth-nerve palsy was -0.1 logMAR units. Six cases died during the five-year follow-up period. An ophthalmic involvement in patients with hematopoietic cancer, especially AIDS-related lymphoma, was associated with poor prognosis. Conclusion. Because ophthalmic involvement in patients with hematopoietic malignancy has a poor prognosis, an early diagnosis of the cancers by the ophthalmologic findings by ophthalmologists could improve the prognosis.",,"['Yoshida-Hata, Natsuyo', 'Katai, Naomichi', 'Oshitari, Toshiyuki']","['Yoshida-Hata N', 'Katai N', 'Oshitari T']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4476-522X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9926-8696', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8273-845X']","['Department of Ophthalmology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, 1-21-1 Toyama, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8655, Japan.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Chiba University Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160607,United States,Case Rep Ophthalmol Med,Case reports in ophthalmological medicine,101581018,,,,PMC4914723,2016/07/05 06:00,2016/07/05 06:01,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2016/6074968 [doi]'],ppublish,Case Rep Ophthalmol Med. 2016;2016:6074968. doi: 10.1155/2016/6074968.

However, the increase in the number of sorafenib tumor resistant cells reduces efficiency. A better knowledge of the intracellular mechanism of the drug leading to reduced cell survival could help to improve the benefits of sorafenib therapy. Autophagy is a bulk cellular degradation process activated in a broad range of stress situations, which allows cells to degrade misfolded proteins or dysfunctional organelles. This cellular route can induce survival or death, depending on cell status and media signals. Sorafenib, alone or in combination with other drugs is able to induce autophagy, but cell response to the drug depends on the complex integrative crosstalk of different intracellular signals. In cancerous cells, autophagy can be regulated by different cellular pathways (Akt-related mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition, 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) induction, dissociation of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family proteins from Beclin-1), or effects of some miRNAs. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by sorafenib and diminished interaction between Beclin-1 and myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) have been related to induction of autophagy in HCC. Furthermore, changes in some miRNAs, such as miR-30alpha, are able to modulate autophagy and modify sensitivity in sorafenib-resistant cells. However, although AMPK phosphorylation by sorafenib seems to play a role in the antiproliferative action of the drug, it does not relate with modulation of autophagy. In this review, we present an updated overview of the effects of sorafenib on autophagy and its related activation pathways, analyzing in detail the involvement of autophagy on sorafenib sensitivity and resistance.",,"['Prieto-Dominguez, Nestor', 'Ordonez, Raquel', 'Fernandez, Anna', 'Garcia-Palomo, Andres', 'Muntane, Jordi', 'Gonzalez-Gallego, Javier', 'Mauriz, Jose L']","['Prieto-Dominguez N', 'Ordonez R', 'Fernandez A', 'Garcia-Palomo A', 'Muntane J', 'Gonzalez-Gallego J', 'Mauriz JL']",,"['Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), University of LeonLeon, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), University of LeonLeon, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), University of LeonLeon, Spain.', 'Service of Clinical Oncology, Complejo Asistencial Universitario de Leon (Hospital of Leon) Leon, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Department of General Surgery""Virgen del Rocio""-""Virgen Macarena"" University Hospital/IBiS/CSIC/Universidad de Sevilla, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), University of LeonLeon, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Enfermedades Hepaticas y Digestivas (CIBERehd)Leon, Spain; Institute of Biomedicine (IBIOMED), University of LeonLeon, Spain.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160608,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC4896953,2016/07/05 06:00,2016/07/05 06:01,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/05 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2016.00151 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2016 Jun 8;7:151. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2016.00151. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'cancer therapeutic', 'dug resistance', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'sorafenib']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to assess the overall survival (OS) of Nigerian patients with CML receiving imatinib therapy and to identify the significant predictors of OS. METHODS: All patients with CML receiving imatinib from July 2003 to June 2013 were studied. The clinical and hematological parameters were studied. The Kaplan-Meier technique was used to estimate the OS and median survival. P-value of <0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: The median age of all 527 patients (male/female = 320/207) was 37 (range 10-87) years. There were 472, 47, and 7 in chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase, and blastic phase, respectively. As at June 2013, 442 patients are alive. The median survival was 105.7 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 91.5-119.9); while OS at one, two, and five years were 95%, 90%, and 75%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that OS was significantly better in patients diagnosed with CP (P = 0.001, odds ratio = 1.576, 95% CI = 1.205-2.061) or not in patients with anemia (P = 0.031, odds ratio = 1.666, 95% CI = 1.047-2.649). Combining these variables yielded three prognostic groups: CP without anemia, CP with anemia, and non-CP, with significantly different median OS of 123.3, 92.0, and 74.7 months, respectively (chi (2) = 22.042, P = 0.000016).

Therefore, the development of new drugs or effective combination therapies is urgently needed. Cotylenin A (CN-A) (a plant growth regulator) is a potent inducer of differentiation in myeloid leukemia cells and exhibits potent antitumor activities in several cancer cell lines. In the present study, we demonstrated that CN-A and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), an inducer of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a dietary anticarcinogenic compound, synergistically inhibited the proliferation of MIAPaCa-2, PANC-1 and gemcitabine-resistant PANC-1 cells. A combined treatment with CN-A and PEITC also effectively inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of these cancer cells. The combined treatment with CN-A and PEITC strongly induced cell death within 1 day at concentrations at which CN-A or PEITC alone did not affect cell viability. A combined treatment with synthetic CN-A derivatives (ISIR-005 and ISIR-042) or fusicoccin J (CN-A-related natural product) and PEITC did not have synergistic effects on cell death. The combined treatment with CN-A and PEITC synergistically induced the generation of ROS. Antioxidants (N-acetylcysteine and trolox), ferroptosis inhibitors (ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin), and the lysosomal iron chelator deferoxamine canceled the synergistic cell death. Apoptosis inhibitors (Z-VAD-FMK and Q-VD-OPH) and the necrosis inhibitor necrostatin-1s did not inhibit synergistic cell death. Autophagy inhibitors (3-metyladenine and chloroquine) partially prevented cell death. These results show that synergistic cell death induced by the combined treatment with CN-A and PEITC is mainly due to the induction of ferroptosis. Therefore, the combination of CN-A and PEITC has potential as a novel therapeutic strategy against pancreatic cancer.",,"['Kasukabe, Takashi', 'Honma, Yoshio', 'Okabe-Kado, Junko', 'Higuchi, Yusuke', 'Kato, Nobuo', 'Kumakura, Shunichi']","['Kasukabe T', 'Honma Y', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Higuchi Y', 'Kato N', 'Kumakura S']",,"['Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.', 'Cancer Center, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.', 'Research Institute for Clinical Oncology, Saitama Cancer Center, Saitama 362-0806, Japan.', 'The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka 567-0047, Japan.', 'The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka 567-0047, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Education and Research, Faculty of Medicine, Shimane University, Izumo 693-8501, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160610,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (ISIR-042)', '0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (cotylenin A)', '0 (ferrostatin-1)', '0 (quinoline-val-asp(OMe)-CH2-OPH)', '6U7TFK75KV (phenethyl isothiocyanate)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclohexylamines/*metabolism', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Glycosides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phenylenediamines/*metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/03/07 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2016/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/or.2016.4867 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2016 Aug;36(2):968-76. doi: 10.3892/or.2016.4867.

There are limited data on the use of haploidentical transplantation (HIDT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in the setting of a second HSCT after an MRDT or MUDT. We analyzed the outcomes of 20 patients who received HIDT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide as a second HSCT after an MRDT (n = 10) or MUDT (n = 10). The median time from the first to the second HSCT was 20.7 months (range, 2.7 to 65.8). Ten patients had acute myelogenous leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome, 6 had acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 2 had chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, and 2 had myeloproliferative neoplasms. All patients received cytoreductive therapy before HIDT, with 12 (60%) achieving complete remission and 8 (40%) with active disease at the time of transplant. All patients achieved sustained engraftment with median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment of 17.5 days (range, 14 to 44) and 32 days (range, 15 to 99), respectively. Nineteen patients (95%) achieved full donor chimerism in both the T cell and myeloid lineages at day 30 post-HSCT. The cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and grades III to IV acute graft-versus-host disease at 180 days were 36% and 10%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease was 13% at 1 year post-HIDT. At a median follow-up of 38 months, the probability of overall survival, disease-free survival, nonrelapse mortality, and relapse post-HIDT were 52%, 39%, 29%, and 33% at 1 year and 34%, 31%, 29%, and 40% at 3 years, respectively. These data suggest that HIDT is an effective strategy to treat relapsed hematologic malignancies after MRDT or MUDT. Further studies to confirm these observations are warranted.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

The disorder consists of precursor B or T phenotypes. In the pediatric population, ALL was a success story in that 80% of children with ALL enjoy long-term survival. In adults, similar complete remission rates are achieved with current induction regimens; however, less than 50% of patients are alive at 5 years, with most deaths due to relapsed disease. Accordingly, optimizing post remission consolidation therapy might improve in outcomes. Such strategies may include chemotherapy and autologous or allogeneic transplant. Moreover, the ability to modify such therapy based on better disease risk stratification while taking into account patient characteristics such as performance status and presence of comorbidities is necessary to tailor treatment accordingly.

Overall response rates after chemoimmunotherapy range from 43% to 67%, but remissions are generally short-lived. In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (all-HCT) is considered a potentially curative treatment modality, yielding 3-year overall survival rates exceeding 50% and a plateau in survival curves. In Richter syndrome, efficacy of allo-HCT depends on demonstrating an objective response (complete remission or partial response) before allografting, with resulting 3-year survival rates of 41% to 75%. On the other hand, the efficacy of autologous HCT is limited, especially when considering that patients autografted for Richter syndrome might relapse with CLL in 35% of cases. Notwithstanding the scarcity of published data, we recommend that patients with Richter syndrome should be referred to transplant centers as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed to evaluate their candidacy for allo-HCT. Establishing a clonal relationship to CLL is important considering the more aggressive disease course in clonally related Richter syndrome. Moreover, achievement of a complete remission or partial response to salvage therapy must be a prerequisite before moving forward with allografting for Richter syndrome. Patients who fail to demonstrate an objective response to salvage therapy should be considered for enrollment in clinical trials.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Frequent metastasis and recurrence are the main reasons for the poor prognosis of PC patients. Thus, the discovery of new biomarkers and wider insights into the mechanisms involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis and metastasis is crucial. In the present study, we report that leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis of PC cells both in vitro and in vivo. LIFR expression was significantly lower in PC tissues and was associated with local invasion (P=0.047), lymph node metastasis (P=0.014) and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage (P=0.002). Overexpression of LIFR significantly suppressed PC cell colony formation (P=0.005), migration (P=0.003), invasion (P=0.010) and wound healing ability (P=0.013) in vitro, while opposing results were observed after LIFR was silenced. Furthermore, animal xenograft and metastasis models confirm that the in vivo results were consistent with the outcomes in vitro. Meanwhile, LIFR inhibited the expression of beta-catenin, vimentin and slug and induced the expression of E-cadherin, suggesting that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulation pathway may underlie the mechanism.

The clinical applications of both chemotherapy and targeted drugs are limited because of the complexity of gastric cancer. In this study, sulforhodamine B, colony formation assay, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) stain, flow cytometry were used to determine the in vitro cytotoxicity, apoptosis and mitochondrial membrane potential of gastric cancer AGS and HGC-27 cells before and after treatment. Real-time PCR and Western blot were used to analyse the mRNA transcription and protein expression respectively. Confocal microscopy was used to determine the localization of target protein within the cells. Treatment with the combination of ABT-737 and 2,5-dimethyl-celecoxib (DMC) showed strong synergistic effect in both AGS and HGC-27 cells. Moreover, DMC would not influence the intracellular prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) level, thus lacking the toxicity profile of celecoxib. Interestingly, given the significant synergistic effect, combination treatment did not affect the protein expression of BH-3 proteins including Puma, Noxa and Bim. In combination treatment, cell apoptosis was found independent of caspase-3 activation. The translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochondrion to nuclear was responsible for the induced apoptosis in the combination treatment. Taken together, this study provided a novel combination treatment regimen for gastric cancer. Furthermore, the existence of caspase-independent apoptotic pathway induced by treatment of ABT-737 was not yet seen until combined with DMC, which shed light on an alternative mechanism involved in Bcl-2 inhibitor-induced apoptosis.","['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Originally, NS was thought to exert its effects through inhibiting p53, while recent studies have revealed that NS is also able to function independently of p53. The present study performed a gene expression profiling analysis of p53mutant NB4 leukeima cells following knockdown of NS in order to elucidate the p53independent NS pathway. NS expression was silenced using lentivirusmediated RNA interference technology, and gene expression profiling of NB4 cells was performed by DNA microarray analysis. A total of 1,953 genes were identified to be differentially expressed (fold change >/=2 or </=0.5) following knockdown of NS expression. Furthermore, reversetranscription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect the expression of certain candidate genes, and the results were in agreement with the micaroarray data. Pathway analysis indicated that aberrant genes were enhanced in endoplasmic, cJun Nterminal kinase and mineral absorption pathways. The present study shed light on the mechanisms of the p54independent NS pathway in NB4 cells and provided a foundation for the discovery of promising targets for the treatment of p53-mutant leukemia.",,"['Sun, Xiaoli', 'Jia, Yu', 'Wei, Yuanyu', 'Liu, Shuai', 'Yue, Baohong']","['Sun X', 'Jia Y', 'Wei Y', 'Liu S', 'Yue B']",,"['Department of Laboratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450052, P.R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, typical AMSC lines were established, and their characteristics including morphology, typical markers and differentiation potentiality were tested. RESULTS: The cells exhibited typical MSC morphology and were positive for CD90, CD44 and CD166, considered to be MSCs surface markers. They were negative for CD34 and CD45. The CAMSCs also exhibited embryonic stem cell (ESC) markers, including Oct4 and Sox2, at passage 2. In an appropriate microenvironment, CAMSCs differentiated into EBs and were able to produce cells of the three germ layers. These results indicate that established cells were putative adipocyte-derived MSCs, which also displayed properties of ESCs. Moreover, when the CAMSCs were induced by bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), they differentiated into PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) and male germ-like cells, which were positive for PR domain-containing 1 (Prdm1), PR domain-containing 14 (Prdm14), doublesex and mab-3 related transcription factor (Dmrt1), as well as for promyelocytic leukaemia zinc finger (Plzf). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting analysis verified higher expression levels of these markers. CONCLUSION: This study provides an efficient approach to study germ cell development using CAMSCs.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Wei, Yudong', 'Fang, Jia', 'Cai, Shufang', 'Lv, Changrong', 'Zhang, Shiqiang', 'Hua, Jinlian']","['Wei Y', 'Fang J', 'Cai S', 'Lv C', 'Zhang S', 'Hua J']",,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shaanxi Centre of Stem Cells Engineering & Technology, Northwest A&F University, Yangling Shaanxi 712100, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160704,England,Cell Prolif,Cell proliferation,9105195,['0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)'],IM,"['Adipogenesis', 'Adipose Tissue/*cytology/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chondrogenesis', 'Dogs', 'Germ Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Osteogenesis']",PMC6496567,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/01/26 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/04/27 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cpr.12271 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Prolif. 2016 Aug;49(4):503-11. doi: 10.1111/cpr.12271.

METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed 8 consecutive patients with severe refractory scGVHD who received salvage therapy with imatinib. Patients intolerant and/or refractory to imatinib received dasatinib treatment. RESULTS: 7 patients discontinued imatinib treatment (1 achieved complete response, 5 were resistant and/or intolerant, and 1 developed grade IV neutropenia) and 1 patient achieved prolonged partial response, but died due to an infectious complication while on treatment. 5 patients started dasatinib treatment (3 achieved partial responses and discontinued dasatinib, 1 achieved a durable partial response, but died due to a consecutive rapid pulmonary cGVHD progression and 1 with stable disease discontinued treatment due to gastroenteric intolerance). The response rate (partial and/or complete responses) for severe scGVHD was 25% for imatinib and 60% for dasatinib. CONCLUSION: In our series, dasatinib was better tolerated, safer, steroid-sparing, and had a low incidence of infectious complications, which suggests that it may be a more effective therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory scGVHD than imatinib. Treatment of scGVHD with effective antifibrotic drugs such as TKI, which block the kinase fibrotic pathway, may be a safe and effective therapeutic option, but further studies are needed to confirm our findings.",,"['Sanchez-Ortega, Isabel', 'Parody, Rocio', 'Servitje, Octavio', 'Muniesa, Cristina', 'Arnan, Montserrat', 'Patino, Beatriz', 'Sureda, Anna', 'Duarte, Rafael F']","['Sanchez-Ortega I', 'Parody R', 'Servitje O', 'Muniesa C', 'Arnan M', 'Patino B', 'Sureda A', 'Duarte RF']",,"[""Isabel Sanchez-Ortega, Department of Hematology, ICO - Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Barcelona 08908, Spain, isanchez-ortega@iconcologia.net.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Croatia,Croat Med J,Croatian medical journal,9424324,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Sclerosis/complications/*drug therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4937227,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/02/23 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3325/cmj.2016.57.247 [doi]'],ppublish,Croat Med J. 2016 Jun 30;57(3):247-54. doi: 10.3325/cmj.2016.57.247.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that a subpopulation of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) can utilize gonadal adipose tissue (GAT) as a niche to support their metabolism and evade chemotherapy. In a mouse model of blast crisis chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), adipose-resident LSCs exhibit a pro-inflammatory phenotype and induce lipolysis in GAT. GAT lipolysis fuels fatty acid oxidation in LSCs, especially within a subpopulation expressing the fatty acid transporter CD36. CD36(+) LSCs have unique metabolic properties, are strikingly enriched in AT, and are protected from chemotherapy by the GAT microenvironment. CD36 also marks a fraction of human blast crisis CML and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells with similar biological properties. These findings suggest striking interplay between leukemic cells and AT to create a unique microenvironment that supports the metabolic demands and survival of a distinct LSC subpopulation.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

To determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of iAMP21 in Korean B-ALL patients, we performed FISH and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analyses. METHODS: A total of 102 childhood B-ALL patients were screened with ETV6-RUNX1 FISH probes (Abbott Molecular, USA). The presence of an iAMP21 was confirmed by using MLPA P327 iAMP21-ERG probemix (MRC Holland, The Netherlands). RESULTS: iAMP21 was detected in one of the screened B-ALL patients (1/102 patients, 1.0%) who presented the ALL immunophenotype and complex karyotype at initial diagnosis. The patient relapsed twice after bone marrow transplantation. MLPA showed 12.5-Mb and 4.28-Mb regions of amplification and deletion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of iAMP21 is considerable in Korean pediatric patients. Our report suggests that iAMP21 in childhood B-ALL has very unfavorable impact on patient's prognosis.

Owing to the rarity of LFS, few cases have been reported in Korea thus far. This study aimed to retrospectively review the mutations and clinical characteristics of Korean patients with LFS. METHODS: TP53 mutation was screened in 89 unrelated individuals at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from 2004 to 2015. Six additional mutation carriers were obtained from the literature. RESULTS: We identified nine different mutations in 14 Korean patients (male to female ratio=0.3:1). Two such frameshift mutations (p.Pro98Leufs*25, p.Pro27Leufs*17) were novel. The recurrent mutations were located at codons 31 (n=2; p.Val31Ile), 175 (n=3; p.Arg175His), and 273 (n=4; p.Arg273His and p.Arg273Cys). The median age at the first tumor onset was 25 yr. Ten patients (71%) developed multiple primary tumors. A diverse spectrum of tumors was observed, including breast (n=6), osteosarcoma (n=4), brain (n=4), leukemia (n=2), stomach (n=2), thyroid (n=2), lung (n=2), skin (n=2), bladder (n=1), nasal cavity cancer (n=1), and adrenocortical carcinoma (n=1). CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable heterogeneity in the TP53 mutations and tumor spectrum in Korean patients with LFS. Our results suggest shared and different LFS characteristics between Caucasian and Korean patients.

We evaluated the applicability of NPM1 type A mutation (NPM1-mutA) quantitation for this purpose. METHODS: Twenty-seven AML patients with normal karyotype but bearing the mutated NPM1 were enrolled in the study, and real-time quantitative PCR of NPM1-mutA was performed on 93 bone marrow (BM) samples (27 samples at diagnosis and 56 at follow-up). The NPM1-mutA allele burdens (represented as the NPM1-mutA/Abelson gene (ABL) ratio) at diagnosis and at follow-up were compared. RESULTS: The median NPM1-mutA/ABL ratio was 1.3287 at diagnosis and 0.092 at 28 days after chemotherapy, corresponding to a median log10 reduction of 1.7061. Significant correlations were observed between BM blast counts and NPM1-mutA quantitation results measured at diagnosis (gamma=0.5885, P=0.0012) and after chemotherapy (gamma=0.5106, P=0.0065). Total 16 patients achieved morphologic complete remission at 28 days after chemotherapy, and 14 (87.5%) patients showed a >3 log10 reduction of the NPM1-mutA/ABL ratio. The NPM1-mutA allele was detected in each of five patients who had relapsed, giving a median increase of 0.91-fold of the NPM1-mutA/ABL ratio at relapse over that at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The NPM1-mutA quantitation results corresponded to BM assessment results with high stability at relapse, and could predict patient outcomes.

The 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly higher in patients who had received FB than that in patients who had received FM (66.7% vs. 17.8%, p=0.004), and FB was an independent prognostic factor for relapse by a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 9.8; 95% confidential interval, 2.5-39.3; p=0.001). When we restricted the evaluation to patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, the 3-year cumulative incidence of relapse was also significantly higher in patients who had received FB than that in patients who had received FM (75.0% vs. 16.1%, p=0.004).

We investigated the use of non-HLA-matched ex-vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells to accelerate haemopoietic recovery and reduce infections after chemotherapy. METHODS: We enrolled patients with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia by WHO criteria and aged 18-70 years inclusive at our institution (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center) into this phase 1 trial. The primary endpoint of the study was safety of infusion of non-HLA-matched expanded cord blood progenitor cells after administration of clofarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor priming. The protocol is closed to accrual and analysis was performed per protocol. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01031368. FINDINGS: Between June 29, 2010, and June 26, 2012, 29 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (19 newly diagnosed, ten relapsed or refractory) were enrolled. The most common adverse events were fever (27 [93%] of 29 patients) and infections (25 [86%] of 29 patients). We observed one case of acute infusional toxicity (attributed to an allergic reaction to dimethyl sulfoxide) in the 29 patients enrolled, who received 42 infusions of expanded progenitor cells. The following additional serious but expected adverse events were observed (each in one patient): grade 4 atrial fibrillation, grade 4 febrile neutropenia, lung infection with grade 4 absolute neutrophil count, colon infection with grade 4 absolute neutrophil count, grade 4 changed mental status, and one death from liver failure. No unexpected toxicity or graft-versus-host disease was observed. There was no evidence of in-vivo persistence of the expanded progenitor cell product in any patient beyond 14 days or induced alloimmunisation. INTERPRETATION: Infusion of the expanded progenitor cell product seemed safe and might provide a promising treatment method for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia.

In this study we aimed to investigate the potential of rituximab maintenance therapy to prolong disease control in patients who respond to rituximab-containing induction regimens. METHODS: In this randomised, international, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 clinical trial, we enrolled patients who had achieved a complete response (CR), CR with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi), or partial response (PR) to first-line or second-line rituximab-containing chemoimmunotherapy and randomly assigned them in a 1:1 ratio (central block randomisation in the electronic case report form system) to either intravenous rituximab 375 mg/m(2) every 3 months, or observation alone, for 2 years. Stratification was by country, line of treatment, type of chemotherapy added to the rituximab backbone, and degree of remission following induction. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Efficacy analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population. This is the final, event-triggered analysis. Final analysis was triggered by the occurrence of 92 events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01118234. FINDINGS: Between April 1, 2010, and Dec 23, 2013, 134 patients were randomised to rituximab and 129 to observation alone. Median observation times were 33.4 months (IQR 25.7-42.8) for the rituximab group and 34.0 months (25.4-41.9) for the observation group. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the rituximab maintenance group (47.0 months, IQR 28.5-incalculable) than with observation alone (35.5 months, 95% CI 25.7-46.3; hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, 95% CI 0.33-0.75, p=0.00077). The incidence of grade 3-4 haematological toxicities other than neutropenia was similar in the two treatment groups. Grade 3-4 neutropenia occurred in 28 (21%) patients in the rituximab group and 14 (11%) patients in the observation group. Apart from neutropenia, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events were upper (five vs one [1%] patient in the observation group) and lower (three [2%] vs one [1%]) respiratory tract infection, pneumonia (nine [7%] vs two [2%]), thrombopenia (four [3%] vs four [3%]), neoplasms (five [4%] vs four [3%]), and eye disorders (four [3%] vs two [2%]). The overall incidence of infections of all grades was higher among rituximab recipients (88 [66%] vs 65 [50%]). INTERPRETATION: Rituximab maintenance therapy prolongs progression-free survival in patients achieving at least a PR to induction with rituximab plus chemotherapy, and the treatment is well tolerated overall. Although it is associated with an increase in infections, there is no excess in infection mortality, suggesting that remission maintenance with rituximab is an effective and safe option in the management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in early treatment phases.

Allosteric inhibition of Bcr-Abl represent a new frontier in the fight against resistant leukemia and few candidates have been identified in the last few years. Among these, myristate pocket (MP) binders discovered by Novartis (e.g. GNF2/5) showed promising results, although they proved to be active against the T315I mutant only in combination with first and second generation ATP-competitive inhibitors. Here we used a cascade screening approach based on sequential fluorescence polarization (FP) screening, in silico docking/dynamics studies and kinetic-enzymatic studies to identify novel MP binders. A pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative (6) has been identified as a promising allosteric inhibitor active on 32D leukemia cell lines (expressing Bcr-Abl WT and T315I) with no need of combination with any ATP-competitive inhibitor.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We found that Id2 acts as a key regulator of leukemia stem cell (LSC) potential in MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Low endogenous Id2 expression is associated with LSC enrichment while Id2 overexpression impairs MLL-AF9-leukemia initiation and growth. Importantly, MLL-AF9 itself controls the E-protein pathway by suppressing Id2 while directly activating E2-2 expression, and E2-2 depletion phenocopies Id2 overexpression in MLL-AF9-AML cells. Remarkably, Id2 tumor-suppressive function is conserved in t(8;21) AML. Low expression of Id2 and its associated gene signature are associated with poor prognosis in MLL-rearranged and t(8;21) AML patients, identifying the Id2/E-protein axis as a promising new therapeutic target in AML.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2016.

Herein we show that CLL cells but not normal B cells can receive apoptotic signals through physical contact with TNF-alpha activated endothelium impairing survival in transendothelial migration (TEM) assays. In addition, the CLL cells of patients having lymphadenopathy (LApos) show a survival advantage during TEM that can be linked to increased expression of alpha4 and alphaL integrin chains. Within this context, ephrinA4 expressed on the surface of CLL cells sequestrates integrins and inactivates them resulting in reduced adhesion and inhibition of apoptotic/survival signals through them. In agreement, ephrinA4 silencing resulted in increased survival of CLL cells of LApos patients but not LA neg patients. Similarly was observed when a soluble ephrinA4 isoform was added to TEM assays strongly suggesting that accumulation of this isoform in the serum of LApos patients could contribute to CLL cells dissemination and survival in vivo. In supporting, CLL lymphadenopathies showed a preferential accumulation of apoptotic CLL cells around high endothelial venules lacking ephrinA4. Moreover, soluble ephrinA4 isolated from sera of patients increased the number and viability of CLL cells recovered from the lymph nodes of adoptively transferred mice. Finally, we present evidence suggesting that soluble ephrinA4 mediated survival during TEM could enhance a transcellular TEM route of the CLL cells. Together these findings point to an important role of ephrinA4 in the nodal dissemination of CLL cells governing extravasation and survival.",,"['Flores, Miguel A', 'Fortea, Paula', 'Trinidad, Eva M', 'Garcia, Dolores', 'Soler, Gloria', 'Ortuno, Francisco J', 'Zapata, Agustin G', 'Alonso-Colmenar, Luis M']","['Flores MA', 'Fortea P', 'Trinidad EM', 'Garcia D', 'Soler G', 'Ortuno FJ', 'Zapata AG', 'Alonso-Colmenar LM']",,"['Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy Research Center, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Jose Antonio Novais, 2, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy Research Center, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Jose Antonio Novais, 2, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Transformation and Metastasis Group, Cancer Epigenetic and Molecular Biology Program (PEBC), IDIBELL, 08908 Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, HGU Morales Meseguer, Marques de los Velez, 30008 Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, HGU Morales Meseguer, Marques de los Velez, 30008 Murcia, Spain.', 'Hematology and Medical Oncology Department, HGU Morales Meseguer, Marques de los Velez, 30008 Murcia, Spain.', 'Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy Research Center, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Jose Antonio Novais, 2, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Cytometry and Fluorescence Microscopy Research Center, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Biology, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Jose Antonio Novais, 2, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (CD11a Antigen)', '0 (Ephrin-A4)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '143198-26-9 (Integrin alpha4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'CD11a Antigen/*metabolism', '*Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelium/metabolism', 'Ephrin-A4/blood/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Isoforms/blood/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms', 'Transendothelial and Transepithelial Migration', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC5217033,2016/07/05 06:00,2018/01/13 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/13 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10311 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10311 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 26;7(30):48481-48500. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10311.,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'ephrin', 'extravasation', 'integrin', 'leukemia']",,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its effect on acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and underlying molecular mechanism are poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore its effect on APL and underlying mechanism based on metabolomics. Firstly, multiple assays indicated that celastrol could induce apoptosis of APL cells via p53-activated mitochondrial pathway. Secondly, unbiased metabolomics revealed that uridine was the most notable changed metabolite. Further study verified that uridine could reverse the apoptosis induced by celastrol. The decreased uridine was caused by suppressing the expression of gene encoding Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, whose inhibitor could also induce apoptosis of APL cells. At last, mouse model confirmed that celastrol inhibited tumor growth through enhanced apoptosis. Celastrol could also decrease uridine and DHODH protein level in tumor tissues. Our in vivo study also indicated that celastrol had no systemic toxicity at pharmacological dose (2 mg/kg, i.p., 21 days). Altogether, our metabolomics study firstly reveals that uridine deficiency contributes to mitochondrial apoptosis induced by celastrol in APL cells.

The serine threonine kinase Pim-1 is a pro-survival oncogene transcriptionally upregulated by FLT3-ITD that also promotes its signaling in a positive feedback loop. Thus inhibiting Pim-1 represents an attractive approach in targeting FLT3-ITD cells. Indeed, co-treatment with the pan-Pim kinase inhibitor AZD1208 or expression of a kinase-dead Pim-1 mutant sensitized FLT3-ITD cell lines to apoptosis triggered by chemotherapy drugs including the topoisomerase 2 inhibitors daunorubicin, etoposide and mitoxantrone, but not the nucleoside analog cytarabine. AZD1208 sensitized primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors, but did not sensitize AML cells with wild-type FLT3 or remission bone marrow cells, supporting a favorable therapeutic index. Mechanistically, the enhanced apoptosis observed with AZD1208 and topoisomerase 2 inhibitor combination treatment was associated with increased DNA double-strand breaks and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and co-treatment with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl cysteine rescued FLT3-ITD cells from AZD1208 sensitization to topoisomerase 2 inhibitors.

However, little is known about the role of Cdh1 in hematopoiesis. Here we analyzed Cdh1 expression and function in malignant hematopoiesis. We found a significant decrease of Cdh1 in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts compared to normal CD34+ cells. Thus, according to its important role in connecting cell cycle exit and differentiation, decreased expression of Cdh1 may be a mechanism contributing to the differentiation block in leukemogenesis. Indeed, knockdown (kd) of Cdh1 in HL-60 cell line (AML with maturation, FAB M2) led to less differentiated cells and a delay in PMA-induced differentiation. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, FAB M3) is an AML subtype which is highly vulnerable to differentiation therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Accordingly, we found that APL is resistant to a Cdh1-kd mediated differentiation block. However, further depletion of Cdh1 in APL significantly reduced viability of leukemia cells upon ATRA-induced differentiation. Thus, low Cdh1 expression may be important in AML biology by contributing to the differentiation block and response to therapy depending on differences in the microenvironment and the additional genetic background.",,"['Ewerth, Daniel', 'Schmidts, Andrea', 'Hein, Manuel', 'Schnerch, Dominik', 'Kvainickas, Arunas', 'Greil, Christine', 'Duyster, Justus', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Wasch, Ralph']","['Ewerth D', 'Schmidts A', 'Hein M', 'Schnerch D', 'Kvainickas A', 'Greil C', 'Duyster J', 'Engelhardt M', 'Wasch R']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Present address: Department of Cardiology and Angiology II, University Heart Center Freiburg - Bad Krozingen, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Bad Krozingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Present address: Center for Biological Systems Analysis, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, University Medical Center, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CDH1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD', 'Cadherins/antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5217013,2016/07/05 06:00,2018/03/14 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2015/09/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['10196 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10196 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 26;7(30):48220-48230. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10196.,['NOTNLM'],"['Cdh1', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'anaphase-promoting complex', 'differentiation', 'ubiquitin-ligase']",,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite recent advances in the characterization of pathogenesis of AML, the cure rates are under 40%, being leukemia relapse the most common cause of treatment failure. Leukaemia relapse occurs due to clonal evolution or clonal escape. In this study, we aimed to analyze the clinical and biological factors influencing outcomes in patients with AML relapse. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We included a total of 75 AML patients who experienced leukaemia relapse after achieving complete remission. We performed complete immunophenotyping and conventional karyotyping in bone marrow aspirates obtained at diagnosis and at leukemia relapse. RESULTS: Overall survival (OS) of the series was 3.7%+/-2.3, leukaemia progression being the most common cause of death. Patients relapsing before 12 months and those with adverse cytogenetic-molecular risk had statistically significant worse outcomes. A percentage of 52.5 of patients showed phenotypic changes and 50% cytogenetic changes at relapse. We did not find significant clinical factors predicting clonal evolution. The presence of clonal evolution at relapse did not have a significant impact on outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed AML have a dismal prognosis, especially those with early relapse and adverse cytogenetic-molecular risk. Clonal evolution with phenotypic and cytogenetic changes occurred in half of the patients without predictive clinical factors or impact on outcome.","['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

In this study, we report the incidence of MLL rearrangements in AML patients using gene analysis, as well as the clinical significance and prognostic features of these rearrangements. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective study took place from April 2008 to November 2011 in the People's Liberation Army General Hospital. A total 433 AML patients were screened by multiple nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to determine the incidence of the 11 MLL gene rearrangements. There were 68 cases of MLL gene rearrangements, for a positive rate of 15.7%. A total of 24 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT), and 34 patients received at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Ten patients were lost to follow-up. RESULTS The median follow-up was 29 months. The complete remission (CR) rate was 85.4%. The overall survival (OS) was 57.4+/-5.9 months for the Allo-HSCT group and 21.0+/-2.1 months for the chemotherapy group. The Allo-HSCT group had superior survival compared with the chemotherapy group (5-year OS: 59+/-17% vs. 13+/-8%, P<0.01; 5-year disease-free survival [DFS]: 65+/-10% vs. 40+/-16%, P>0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that transplantation, platelets >50x10^9/L at onset, and CR are associated with a better OS in MLL rearranged AML patients. Patients with thrombocytopenia and extramedullary involvement were prone to relapse. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that Allo-HSCT is superior to chemotherapy alone for treating MLL rearranged AML patients. Patients treated with Allo-HSCT have a better prognosis and a longer survival. CR is an independent prognostic factor for OS, and extramedullary involvement is an independent prognostic factor for DFS. MLL rearranged AML patients with thrombocytopenia at onset <50x10^9 had very bad OS and DFS.",,"['Yang, Hua', 'Huang, Sai', 'Zhu, Cheng-Ying', 'Gao, Li', 'Zhu, Hai-Yan', 'Lv, Na', 'Jing, Yu', 'Yu, Li']","['Yang H', 'Huang S', 'Zhu CY', 'Gao L', 'Zhu HY', 'Lv N', 'Jing Y', 'Yu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and BMT, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China (mainland).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160704,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC4941891,2016/07/05 06:00,2017/03/14 06:00,['2016/07/05 06:00'],"['2016/07/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['899186 [pii]', '10.12659/msm.899186 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2016 Jul 4;22:2315-23. doi: 10.12659/msm.899186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Latin America, little epidemiological data exist about these mutations and their influence on clinical evolution and prognosis. Standardization and well-established clinical correlation make FLT3 mutational analysis by molecular methods an invaluable tool to decide among treatment options and to determine AML prognosis. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutations in 138 patients with AML at four hematology referral centers from Mexico and Colombia. Molecular methods based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were employed for determining FLT3-ITD status. RESULTS: Mutations were present in 28 patients indicating a prevalence of 20.28%. Median age was 47 years (5-96). The FLT3 mutation positive group was older, had higher WBC and hemoglobin values and lower platelet counts but without statistical significance. A not previously described mutation in the FLT3 gene was found in one patient involving a nucleotide exchange of timine for cytosine at the 66608 position. A high mortality was found in the FLT3-mutated group, 67.8 vs. 42.72% in the non-mutated group and median survival was 4.9 months vs. 20.4 months, p = 0.009. A mutated FLT3 did not confer poor prognosis to those with M3 AML. The mutated FLT3 population had poor overall survival (OS) despite hematoprogenitor stem cell transplantation (HSCT). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of FLT3-ITD mutation in AML was present in a proportion comparable to other populations and, when present, was associated with a very poor prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2016 IMSS.

Several efficient methods for the detection of ALV have been reported. However, these previously developed approaches are based on either PCR or immunoassays. Here, we used a proximity ligation technique and combined PCR with the immunoassay to develop a novel immuno-PCR (Im-PCR) approach for the detection of ALV. Our data showed that the Im-PCR had high specificity and sensitivity to ALV. The Im-PCR method selectively reacted to ALV but not to the other avian viruses tested. The limit of detection of Im-PCR could reach 0.5 TCID50. Moreover, the results of Im-PCR were in agreement with results from commercial ELISA when the clinical cloaca samples were used for ALV detection.

We investigated whether ChIFNalpha plays a role in avian leukosis virus (ALV) infections of chickens. Firstly, we explored the immune response to ALV in vivo by measuring cytokine expression profiles in the spleens and bursas of chickens during the late stages of ALV-J infection. The results indicated that ALV-J infection could induce a mixed Th1/Th2 cytokine response by elevating levels of both interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-10. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels decreased in the spleen while interferon beta (IFNbeta) and Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) expression levels in the bursa increased significantly. This indicated that ALV-J stimulates a Type I IFN response. Next, we found that different ALV subgroups or strains up-regulated chicken IFN regulatory factor 3 (ChIRF-3) promoter activity, suggesting that ALV infection could trigger Type I IFNs pathway in vitro. Accordingly, we further investigated ChIFNalpha antiviral effects on ALV replication in DF-1 cells by successfully expressing recombinant ChIFNalpha in Escherichia coli (E. coli) strain BL21. The specific activity of the purified rChIFNalpha protein was determined to be 4x10(7)U/mL. When added at 4000U/mL, the recombinant protein restrained ALV replication as measured by decreases in viral protein p27 levels and mRNA expression.

According to our recent studies, the BAALC gene is identified to have high mRNA expression levels in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and those with multidrug resistance. Several polymorphisms are associated with the expression of this gene. To date, there has been no study on the rs62527607 [GT] single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of BAALC gene and its link with childhood acute lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia (AML). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of this polymorphism in pediatric acute leukemia, as well as its relationship with prognosis. DNA samples were extracted from bone marrow slides of 129 children with ALL and 16 children with AML. The rs62527607 [GT] SNP was evaluated using mismatch polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP)-based analysis. The association between the SNP alleles and patient disease-free survival was then assessed. The prevalence of the T-allele of rs62527607 [GT] SNP in childhood T-ALL and pre-B-ALL was 28.3% and 11.2%, respectively. In the pre-B-ALL patients, 3 year disease free survival was associated with the GG genotype. Results showed a robust association between the rs62527607 SNP and the risk of relapse in ALL, but not AML, patients. T-ALL patients with the GT genotype had an 8.75 fold higher risk of relapse. The current study demonstrates a significant association between the genotype GT and the polymorphic allele G424T, and introduces this SNP as a negative prognostic factor in children with ALL.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to report CML treatment response in a developing country in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era. We conducted a longitudinal study of our cohort of CML patients. Socio-demographic, diagnosis, therapeutic, and treatment response parameters were studied. Sokal score, disease phase at diagnosis, delay from diagnosis to treatment, and treatment response were analyzed for their impact on survival. Fifty-five patients with a diagnosis of CML and who received treatment with imatinib for a minimum of 3 months were included in this study. Median follow-up was 170 patient-years. The sex ratio (M/F) was 1.62 and median age at diagnosis was 42 years. At diagnosis, 85.5 % of the patients were in chronic phase (CP), 12.7 % in accelerated phase (AP), and 1.8 % in blast crisis (BC). Sokal risk score distribution was as follows: low risk 29.8 %, intermediate risk 38.3 %, and high risk 31.9 %. Median time from first symptoms to first medical visit was 6.2 months and median time from first medical visit to cytogenetic and or molecular confirmation was 12.4 months. Mean delay time from first medical visit to imatinib initiation was 12.5 months (95 % CI 6.3-18.7). The complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months, the major cytogenetic response (MCR) at 12 months, and the major molecular response (MMR) at 24 months were respectively 82.4, 75, and 25 %. The 2-year overall survival rate was 81 %. Advanced phase at the diagnosis, discontinuation of imatinib therapy over 15 % of the time, lack of CHR at 3 months, lack of MCR at 12 months, and progression of the disease during imatinib therapy were associated with a risk of death (p </= 0.05). Our data confirm the improved prognosis of CML treated with imatinib in the setting of a developing country. However, response rates are lower than in developed countries, and additional efforts should be made to facilitate early diagnosis and improve access to TKI, treatment compliance, and regular molecular monitoring of patients.",,"['Faye, Blaise Felix', 'Dieng, Nata', 'Seck, Moussa', 'Gadji, Macoura', 'Gueye, Youssou Bamar', 'Sy, Diariatou', 'Toure, Sokhna Aissatou', 'Sall, Abibatou', 'Toure, Awa Oumar', 'Dieye, Tandakha Ndiaye', 'Diop, Saliou']","['Faye BF', 'Dieng N', 'Seck M', 'Gadji M', 'Gueye YB', 'Sy D', 'Toure SA', 'Sall A', 'Toure AO', 'Dieye TN', 'Diop S']",,"['Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal.', 'Hematology, Cheikh Anta Diop University, BP 5005, Dakar, Senegal. saliou.diop@ucad.edu.sn.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160701,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cost of Illness', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease Management', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*therapeutic use', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Senegal/epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,2016/07/03 06:00,2017/01/28 06:00,['2016/07/03 06:00'],"['2016/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00277-016-2745-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-016-2745-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2016 Oct;95(10):1603-10. doi: 10.1007/s00277-016-2745-4.

Such immediate and prolonged reactions may adversely influence the release efficacy and intended therapeutic pathway. The lack of suitable in vitro platforms limits our ability to gain insight into the nature of immune responses at a single cell level. In order to establish an in vitro 3D system mimicking the connective host tissue counterpart, we utilized reproducible, compressed, rat-tail collagen polymerized matrices. THP1 cells (human acute monocytic leukaemia cells) differentiated into macrophage-like cells were chosen as cell model and their functionality was retained in the dense rat-tail collagen matrix. Placebo microparticles were later combined in the immune cell seeded system during collagen polymerization and secreted pro-inflammatory factors: TNFalpha and IL-8 were used as immune response readout (ELISA). Our data showed an elevated TNFalpha and IL-8 secretion by macrophage THP1 cells indicating that Placebo microparticles trigger certain immune cell responses under 3D in vivo like conditions. Furthermore, we have shown that the system is sensitive to measure the differences in THP1 macrophage pro-inflammatory responses to Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) microparticles with different API release kinetics. We have successfully developed a tissue-like, advanced, in vitro system enabling selective ""readouts"" of specific responses of immune-related cells. Such system may provide the basis of an advanced toolbox enabling systemic evaluation and prediction of in vivo microparticle reactions on human immune-related cells.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Baill Induces Mitochondrial Apoptosis through the Hsp90/AKT Signalling Pathway in HepG2 Cells.,,10.3390/ijms17071015 [doi] E1015 [pii],"According to the potential anti-hepatoma therapeutic effect of Schisandra chinensis polysaccharides presented in previous studies, a bioactive constituent, homogeneous Schisandra chinensis polysaccharide-0-1 (SCP-0-1), molecular weight (MW) circa 69.980 kDa, was isolated and purified. We assessed the efficacy of SCP-0-1 against human hepatocellular liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells to investigate the effects of its antitumour activity and molecular mechanisms. Anticancer activity was evaluated using microscopy, 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, Hoechst 33258 staining, acridine orange (AO) staining, flow cytometry (FCM), and cell-cycle analysis. SCP-0-1 inhibited the HepG2 cells' growth via inducing apoptosis and second gap/mitosis (G2/M) arrest dose-dependently, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 479.63 microg/mL. Western blotting of key proteins revealed the apoptotic and autophagic potential of SCP-0-1. Besides, SCP-0-1 upregulated Bcl-2 Associated X Protein (Bax) and downregulated B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) in the HepG2 cells. The expression of caspase-3, -8, and -9; poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP); cytochrome c (Cyt C); tumor protein 53 (p53); survivin; sequestosome 1 (p62); microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain-3B (LC3B); mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 (p38); extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK); c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK); protein kinase B (AKT); and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) were evaluated using Western blotting. Our findings demonstrate a novel mechanism through which SCP-0-1 exerts its antiproliferative activity and induces mitochondrial apoptosis rather than autophagy. The induction of mitochondrial apoptosis was attributed to the inhibition of the Hsp90/AKT signalling pathway in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase-independent manner. The results also provide initial evidence on a molecular basis that SCP-0-1 can be used as an anti-hepatocellular carcinoma therapeutic agent in the future.",,"['Chen, Yonglin', 'Shi, Songshan',

Normal cells require strict control over MCL1 expression with aberrant MCL1 expression linked to the emergence of various diseases and chemoresistance. Previous studies have detailed how MCL1 expression is regulated by multiple mechanisms both transcriptionally and translationally. However, characterization of the post-transcriptional regulators of MCL1 mRNA is limited. Polypyrimidine tract binding protein 1 (PTBP1) is a known regulator of post-transcriptional gene expression that can control mRNA splicing, translation, stability and localization. Here we demonstrate that PTBP1 binds to MCL1 mRNA and that knockdown of PTBP1 upregulates MCL1 expression in cancer cells by stabilizing MCL1 mRNA and increasing MCL1 mRNA accumulation in cytoplasm. Further, we show that depletion of PTBP1 protects cancer cells from antitubulin agent-induced apoptosis in a MCL1-dependent manner. Taken together, our findings suggest that PTBP1 is a novel regulator of MCL1 mRNA by which it controls apoptotic response to antitubulin chemotherapeutics.",,"['Cui, J', 'Placzek, W J']","['Cui J', 'Placzek WJ']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",['eng'],"['P30 CA013148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM117391/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160701,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PTBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'RNA Stability/drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",PMC5041196,2016/07/02 06:00,2017/12/12 06:00,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/30 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cdd201660 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2016.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2016 Oct;23(10):1681-90. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2016.60.

Large chromosomal translocations as well as mutations in the genes involved in hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation result in the accumulation of poorly differentiated myeloid cells. AML is a highly heterogeneous disease; although cases can be stratified into favorable, intermediate and adverse-risk groups based on their cytogenetic profile, prognosis within these categories varies widely. The identification of recurrent genetic mutations, such as FLT3-ITD, NMP1 and CEBPA, has helped refine individual prognosis and guide management. Despite advances in supportive care, the backbone of therapy remains a combination of cytarabine- and anthracycline-based regimens with allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible candidates.

However, a subset of patients will fail TKI therapy due to resistance or intolerance. Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM), a protein translation inhibitor, is currently the only approved therapy that does not directly target the kinase domain. It has activity for CML patients irrespective of the phase or underlying kinase domain mutation status. AREAS COVERED: We searched the MEDLINE database for articles published in English on homoharringtonine or omacetaxine from 1970 to present. This article reviews the pharmacokinetics of OM and its clinical evolution for the treatment of CML pre- and post TKI development. Toxicity profile, drug administration and future directions are also discussed. EXPERT OPINION: OM represents a unique addition to the CML therapeutic armamentarium with its distinct mechanism of action and activity. The adverse event profile is manageable and with subcutaneous administration at the approved dose, cardiac toxicity is no longer a concern. The recent approval of home administration will facilitate access to this therapy and increase patient compliance. We conclude with specific scenarios where OM use should be considered in CP and AP-CML patients in the era of TKI therapy.",,"['Damlaj, Moussab', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Assouline, Sarit E']","['Damlaj M', 'Lipton JH', 'Assouline SE']",,"['a Division of Hematology & HSCT, Department of Oncology , King Abdul Aziz Medical City , Riyadh , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.', 'b Department of Oncology , Princess Margaret Cancer Center , Toronto , Canada.', 'c Department of Oncology , Sir Mortimer B Davis Jewish General Hospital , Montreal , Canada.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160715,England,Expert Opin Drug Saf,Expert opinion on drug safety,101163027,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Harringtonines/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",,2016/07/02 06:00,2017/02/28 06:00,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/02/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14740338.2016.1207760 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Saf. 2016 Sep;15(9):1279-86. doi: 10.1080/14740338.2016.1207760.

In addition, the authors examined methylation at the promoter of the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ( MGMT) gene and other prognostic factors predicting length of PFS and OS in these patients. METHODS The medical records of 76 patients having a new diagnosis of histologically ascertained GBM in the period of January 2002 to December 2013 at the authors' institution were retrospectively reviewed. Immunohistochemical staining for MLL4 and UTX was performed on archived paraffin-embedded tissues obtained by biopsy or resection. The methylation status of the MGMT promoter in these tissues was determined by methylation-specific PCR analysis. RESULTS During the follow-up period (mean length 18.1 months, range 4.1-43.5 months), 68 (89.5%) of the patients died. The MGMT promoter was methylated in 49 patients (64.5%) and unmethylated in 27 (35.5%). The immunoreactivity pattern of UTX was identical to that of MLL4; increased expression of these 2 proteins was observed in samples from 34 patients (44.7%) and decreased expression in 42 patients (55.3%). The mean length of PFS was 9.2 months (95% CI 6.8-11.6 months). Extent of surgery, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and methylation status of the MGMT promoter were all associated with increased PFS in the multivariate analysis of factors predicting PFS. The mean length of OS was 18.6 months (95% CI 14.3-22.9 months). Patient age (p = 0.004), WHO performance status score (p = 0.019), extent of surgery (p = 0.007), RPA class (p = 0.036), methylation status of the MGMT promoter (p = 0.010), and increased expression of UTX-MLL4 (p = 0.001) were significantly associated with increased OS in multivariate analysis. Interestingly, in patients with an unmethylated MGMT promoter, immunoreactivity of UTX-MLL4 was not associated with changes in OS (p = 0.350). However, in the patients with a methylated MGMT promoter, increased UTX-MLL4 expression was strongly associated with increased OS (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS The results of this study suggest that increased expression of UTX-MLL4 positively influences the outcome of patients with GBM having a methylated MGMT promoter. Therefore, UTX-MLL4 immunoreactivity could be a useful predictor of the response to conventional treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy among GBM patients whose tumors have a methylated MGMT promoter.",,"['Kim, Jinho', 'Lee, Sung-Hun', 'Jang, Ji Hwan', 'Kim, Mee-Seon', 'Lee, Eun Hee', 'Kim, Young Zoon']","['Kim J', 'Lee SH', 'Jang JH', 'Kim MS', 'Lee EH', 'Kim YZ']",,"['Department of Neurosurgery, Division of Neurooncology, and.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Epigenetics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Division of Neurooncology, and.', 'Department of Pathology, Samsung Changwon Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Changwon, Republic of Korea; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Samsung Changwon Hospital, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Changwon, Republic of Korea; and.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, Division of Neurooncology, and.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",20160701,United States,J Neurosurg,Journal of neurosurgery,0253357,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (KDM6A protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (MLL4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (MGMT protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating', '*Brain Neoplasms', '*Breast Neoplasms', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/genetics', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', '*Glioblastoma', 'Histone Demethylases', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Histones', 'Humans', 'Lysine', 'Methyltransferases', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics']",,2016/07/02 06:00,2019/08/01 06:00,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3171/2016.4.JNS1652 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosurg. 2017 May;126(5):1461-1471. doi: 10.3171/2016.4.JNS1652.

We investigated the expression of total STAT5 and STAT5b in peripheral blood samples of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in correlation with the presence of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and its major oncoprotein (latent membrane protein 1, LMP1). The EBV load was measured in the peripheral blood by real-time PCR for the BXLF1 gene and the levels of LMP1 by PCR and ELISA. Western blotting was performed for total STAT5 and STAT5b in protein extracts. STAT5b was only expressed in patients (not in healthy subjects) and STAT5 but particularly STAT5b expression was correlated with the presence of the virus (77.3% vs. 51.2%, P = 0.006 for STAT5b) and to the expression of LMP1 (58.3% vs. 21.6%, P = 0.011 for STAT5b). Moreover, the expression of STAT5b and the presence of EBV and LMP1 were strongly negatively correlated with the overall survival of the patients (log-rank test P = 0.011, 0.015, 0.006, respectively). Double positive (for EBV and STAT5b) patients had the lowest overall survival (log-rank test P = 0.013). This is the first report of a survival disadvantage of EBV+ patients with CLL, and the first time that STAT5b expression is correlated with survival. The correlation of STAT5 expression with the presence of the virus, along with our survival correlations defines a subgroup of patients with CLL that may benefit from anti-STAT agents.",['(c) 2016 The Authors.

Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is the only obligate electron donor for all of the microsomal cytochrome P450 enzymes including CYP26A1 which is highly specific for ATRA metabolism and efficacy in human myeloid leukaemia cells. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of POR on ATRA efficacy and CYP26A1 expression in human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: Stably expressed POR and POR-RNAi HL-60 cell lines were established by transfecting POR overexpression or RNAi (RNA interference) vectors mediated by lentivirus. The protein expression of POR and CYP26A1 was examined by Western blot. The potential roles of POR on ATRA efficacy in HL-60 cells were explored by cell viability assay, cell cycle distribution, cellular differentiation and apoptosis analysis. KEY FINDINGS: All-trans-retinoic acid treatment caused the expression of POR upregulation and CYP26A1 downregulation in dose- and time-dependent manners. POR overexpression decreased CYP26A1 expression in HL-60 cells. When POR gene was interfered, the downregulation of CYP26A1 expression by ATRA was abolished. In addition, POR overexpression in HL-60 cells significantly compromised ATRA-induced cell proliferation inhibition, cell cycle arrest, differentiation and apoptosis, whereas downregulation of POR significantly potentiated ATRA effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our study therefore suggested that POR played an important role in regulating ATRA efficacy and CYP26A1 expression in HL-60 cells.",['(c) 2016 Royal Pharmaceutical Society.'],"['Hu, Lei', 'Lv, Jin-Feng', 'Zhuo, Wei', 'Zhang, Cong-Min', 'Zhou, Hong-Hao', 'Fan, Lan']","['Hu L', 'Lv JF', 'Zhuo W', 'Zhang CM', 'Zhou HH', 'Fan L']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Hospital Pharmacy, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, China.', 'Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Hunan Key Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Central South University, Changsha, China.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160701,England,J Pharm Pharmacol,The Journal of pharmacy and pharmacology,0376363,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid 4-Hydroxylase/*metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,2016/07/02 06:00,2017/05/16 06:00,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jphp.12591 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pharmacol. 2016 Sep;68(9):1193-202. doi: 10.1111/jphp.12591.

EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A hallmark of CML is the presence of (9; 22) (q34; q11) reciprocal translocation, which is cytogenetically visible as Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and results in the formation of BCR-ABL1 fusion protein. This fusion protein is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase which is necessary and sufficient for malignant transformation. The introduction of imatinib, a BCR-ABL1- targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has revolutionized CML therapy. Subsequently, two other TKIs with increased activity against BCR-ABL1, dasatinib and nilotinib, were developed and approved for CML patients. Nevertheless, CML therapy faces major challenges. RESULTS: The first is the development of resistance to BCR-ABL1 inhibitors in some patients, which can be due to BCR-ABL1 overexpression, differences in cellular drug influx and efflux, activation of alternative signaling pathways, or emergence of BCR-ABL1 kinase domain mutations during TKI treatment. The second is the limited efficiency of BCR-ABL1-TKIs in blast crisis (BC) CML. The third is the insensitivity of CML stem cells to BCR-ABL1 inhibitors. Conventional chemotherapeutics and BCR-ABL1 inhibitors which act by inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis, are ineffective against quiescent CML stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: A better understanding of the mechanisms that underlie TKI resistance, progression to BC, genomic instability and stem cell quiescence is essential to develop curative strategies for patients with CML.",,"['Tabarestani, Sanaz', 'Movafagh, Abolfazl']","['Tabarestani S', 'Movafagh A']",,"['Cancer Research Center, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.', 'Medical Genetics Department, Faculty of Medicine, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, IR Iran.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160222,Iran,Iran J Cancer Prev,Iranian journal of cancer prevention,101500574,,,,PMC4922205,2016/07/02 06:00,2016/07/02 06:01,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2015/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/01/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.17795/ijcp-3961 [doi]'],epublish,Iran J Cancer Prev. 2016 Feb 22;9(1):e3961. doi: 10.17795/ijcp-3961. eCollection 2016 Feb.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aqueous extract of SE (ASE), which contained the highest protein content, dose-dependently inhibited the cancer cell's growth (IC50 value, 10.42 +/- 0.5 microg/mL). Additionally, ASE markedly caused DNA damage by inducing apoptotic body formation, DNA fragmentation, and accumulation of sub-G1 DNA contents. ASE induced apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and 9 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) by regulating the expression of Bcl-2/Bax. Moreover, among its molecular weight fractions, the > 30 kDa fraction showed the highest cell-growth-inhibitory effects, which was inhibited by heat treatment. Furthermore, the > 30 kDa fraction had markedly higher glycine content than the ASE. The presence of two protein bands at around 16 and 32 kDa was identified. In addition, two fractions, F1 and F2, were obtained using anion-exchange chromatography, with the F1 having an improved cell-growth-inhibitory effect than the > 30 kDa fraction.

The CD 10 positive ALL has since long been associated with a favourable prognosis as compared to the CD 10 negative ALL [1, 2]. As immunophenotyping is resource intensive, the monoclonal antibodies (MO ABS), are not in widespread use in our country. The expenses involved make this procedure prohibitive in most institutions. For this reason, a limited panel of MO ABS has been used in this study, with a special emphasis on the CD 10 marker. A total of 25 cases of ALL were studied. 17 cases were found to be positive for the CD 10 marker (68%). These cases were associated with a favourable prognosis as compared to the CD 10 negative group.

To gain further information on this disorder, we searched for ETV6 mutations in the 130 families with inherited thrombocytopenia of unknown origin from our cohort of 274 consecutive pedigrees with familial thrombocytopenia. We identified 20 patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia from seven pedigrees. They have five different ETV6 variants, including three novel mutations affecting the highly conserved E26 transformation-specific domain. The relative frequency of ETV6-related thrombocytopenia was 2.6% in the whole case series and 4.6% among the families with known forms of inherited thrombocytopenia. The degree of thrombocytopenia and bleeding tendency of the patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia were mild, but four subjects developed B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood, resulting in a significantly higher incidence of this condition compared to that in the general population. Clinical and laboratory findings did not identify any particular defects that could lead to the suspicion of this disorder from the routine diagnostic workup. However, at variance with most inherited thrombocytopenias, platelets were not enlarged. In vitro studies revealed that the maturation of the patients' megakaryocytes was defective and that the patients have impaired proplatelet formation. Moreover, platelets from patients with ETV6-related thrombocytopenia have reduced ability to spread on fibrinogen. Since the dominant thrombocytopenias due to mutations in RUNX1 and ANKRD26 are also characterized by normal platelet size and predispose to hematologic malignancies, we suggest that screening for ETV6, RUNX1 and ANKRD26 mutations should be performed in all subjects with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia and normal platelet size.",['Copyright(c) Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Melazzini, Federica', 'Palombo, Flavia', 'Balduini, Alessandra', 'De Rocco, Daniela', 'Marconi, Caterina', 'Noris, Patrizia', 'Gnan, Chiara', 'Pippucci, Tommaso', 'Bozzi, Valeria', 'Faleschini, Michela', 'Barozzi, Serena', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Di Buduo, Christian A', 'Kozubik, Katerina Stano', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Loffredo, Giuseppe', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Alfano, Caterina', 'Seri, Marco', 'Balduini, Carlo L', 'Pecci, Alessandro', 'Savoia, Anna']","['Melazzini F', 'Palombo F', 'Balduini A', 'De Rocco D', 'Marconi C', 'Noris P', 'Gnan C', 'Pippucci T', 'Bozzi V', 'Faleschini M', 'Barozzi S', 'Doubek M', 'Di Buduo CA', 'Kozubik KS', 'Radova L', 'Loffredo G', 'Pospisilova S', 'Alfano C', 'Seri M', 'Balduini CL', 'Pecci A', 'Savoia A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy.', ""Department of Medical and Surgical Science, Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi and University of Bologna, Italy."", 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo and University of Trieste, Italy.', ""Department of Medical and Surgical Science, Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi and University of Bologna, Italy."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo and University of Trieste, Italy.', ""Department of Medical and Surgical Science, Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi and University of Bologna, Italy."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo and University of Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy.', 'University Hospital and Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Oncology, Azienda ""Santobono-Pausilipon"", Pausilipon Hospital, Napoli, Italy.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, Central European Institute of Technology, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""Maurice Wohl Institute, King's College London, UK."", ""Department of Medical and Surgical Science, Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi and University of Bologna, Italy."", 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Foundation and University of Pavia, Italy alessandro.pecci@unipv.it.', 'Department of Medical, Surgical and Health Sciences, IRCCS Burlo Garofolo and University of Trieste, Italy.']",['eng'],['GGP13082/Telethon/Italy'],['Journal Article'],20160630,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (ANKRD26 protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Family', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Pedigree', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics/pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC5394865,2016/11/02 06:00,2017/06/18 06:00,['2016/07/02 06:00'],"['2016/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/11/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2016.147496 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2016.147496 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2016 Nov;101(11):1333-1342. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2016.147496.

Here, we show that this exonuclease is strongly upregulated in human psoriasis, a hyperproliferative and inflammatory skin disease. Similarly, the imiquimod (IMQ)- and Il23-induced mouse psoriasis was associated with a substantial upregulation of Trex2, which was recruited into fragmented chromatin in keratinocytes that were undergoing impaired proliferation, differentiation, and cell death, indicating an important role in DNA processing. Using Trex2 knockout mice, we have found that Trex2 deficiency attenuated IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin inflammation and enhanced IMQ-induced parakeratosis. Also, Il23-induced ear swelling was diminished in Trex2 knockout mice in comparison with wild-type (wt) mice. Transcriptome analysis identified multiple genes that were deregulated by Trex2 loss after treatment with IMQ. Specifically, immune response genes and pathways normally associated with inflammation were downregulated, whereas those related to skin differentiation and chromatin biology showed increased expression. Interestingly, Trex2 deficiency led to decreased IMQ-induced keratinocyte death via both cell autonomous and noncell autonomous mechanisms. Hence, our data indicate that Trex2 acts as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of psoriasis by promoting keratinocyte apoptosis and enucleation and thereby influencing skin immune responses.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Authors.

Recently, TPGS alone has been reported to induce cell death in lung, breast and prostate cancer. However, the effect of TPGS on cancer cell viability remains unclear. Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic effect of TPGS on human periphral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and on T cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) Jurkat clone E6-1 cells and its possible mechanism of action. PBL and Jurkat cells were treated with TPGS (10, 20, 40, 60, and 80 muM), and morphological changes in the cell nucleus, mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels were determined by immune-fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Cellular apoptosis markers were also evaluated by immunocytochemistry. In this study, TPGS induced apoptotic cell death in Jurkat cells, but not in PBL, in a dose-response manner with increasing nuclear DNA fragmentation, increasing cell cycle arrest, and decreasing DeltaPsim. Additionally, TPGS increased dichlorofluorescein fluorescence intensity, indicative of H2O2 production, in a dose-independent fashion. TPGS increased DJ-1 Cys(106)-sulfonate, as a marker of intracellular stress and induced the activation of NF-kappaB, p53 and c-Jun transcription factors. Additionally, it increased the expression of apoptotic markers Bcl-2 related pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and PUMAand activated caspase-3. The antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine and known pharmacological inhibitors protected the cells from the TPGS induced effects. In conclusion, TPGS selectively induces apoptosis in Jurkat cells through two independent but complementary H2O2-mediated signaling pathways.

Thus, MBs derived from salicylaldehydes or 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde and aliphatic amines are the most active compounds. A satisfactory correlation of the EpIIc versus IC50 (muM) in dimethylsulfoxide was observed. The most cytotoxic MBs (Series a-c, derived from salicylaldehydes) showed the least negative EpIIc values. Noteworthy, however, Series d (derived from 2-pyridinecarboxaldehyde) did not follow this correlation.

Furthermore, rohitukine has never been studied for cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibition, kinase profiling and for its experimental physicochemical properties. Thus, herein, we report in vitro cytotoxicity of rohitukine in a panel of 20 cancer cell lines (including leukemia, pancreatic, prostate, breast and CNS) and 2 normal cell lines; kinase profiling, Cdk2/9 inhibition, and physicochemical properties (solubility and stability in biological medias, pKa, LogP, LogD). In cytotoxicity screening, rohitukine displayed promising activity in HL-60 and Molt-4 (leukemia) cell lines with GI50 of 10 and 12muM, respectively. It showed inhibition of Cdk2/A and Cdk9/T1 with IC50 values of 7.3 and 0.3muM, respectively. The key interactions of rohitukine with Cdk9 was also studied by molecular modeling. Rohitukine was found to be highly water soluble (Swater=10.3mg/mL) and its LogP value was -0.55. The ionization constant of rohitukine was found to be 5.83.

Vif polymorphisms found in HIV-1s isolated from infected patients have varying anti-A3G potency when assayed in vitro, but there are few studies demonstrating this in in vivo models. Here, we created Friend murine leukemia viruses encoding vif alleles that were previously shown to differentially neutralize A3G in cell culture or that were originally found in primary HIV-1 isolates. Infection of transgenic mice expressing different levels of human A3G showed that these naturally occurring Vif variants differed in their ability to counteract A3G during in vivo infection, although the effects on viral replication were not identical to those seen in cultured cells. We also found that the polymorphic Vifs that attenuated viral replication reverted to wild type only in A3G transgenic mice. Finally, we found that the level of A3G-mediated deamination was inversely correlated with the level of viral replication.

Of these, 119 engrafted with expected immunophenotype. Targeted sequencing of 374 genes and 265 frequently rearranged RNAs detected recurrent and novel genetic lesions in 48 paired primary tumor (PT) and patient-derived xenotransplant (PDX) samples. Overall, the frequencies of 274 somatic variant alleles correlated between PT and PDX samples, although the data were highly variable for variant alleles present at 0-10%. Seventeen percent of variant alleles were detected in either PT or PDX samples only. Based on variant allele frequency changes, 24 PT-PDX pairs were classified as concordant while the other 24 pairs showed various degree of clonal discordance. There was no correlation of clonal concordance with clinical parameters of diseases. Significantly more bone marrow samples than peripheral blood samples engrafted discordantly.

Here, we provide the first evidence that a small percentage of APL cells undergo a novel cell death pathway by releasing extracellular DNA traps (ETs) in untreated patients. Both APL and NB4 cells stimulated with APL serum had nuclear budding of vesicles filled with chromatin that leaked to the extracellular space when nuclear and cell membranes ruptured. Using immunofluorescence, we found that NB4 cells undergoing ETosis extruded lattice-like structures with a DNA-histone backbone. During all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cell differentiation, a subset of NB4 cells underwent ETosis at days 1 and 3 of treatment. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly elevated at 3 days, and combined treatment with TNF-alpha and IL-6 stimulated NB4 cells to release ETs. Furthermore, inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitors or by small interfering RNA against Atg7 attenuated LC3 autophagy formation and significantly decreased ET generation. Our results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism for death in promyelocytes and suggest that ATRA may accelerate ET release through increased cytokines and autophagosome formation. Targeting this cellular death pathway in addition to conventional chemotherapy may provide new therapeutic modalities for APL.",,"['Ma, R', 'Li, T', 'Cao, M', 'Si, Y', 'Wu, X', 'Zhao, L', 'Yao, Z', 'Zhang, Y', 'Fang, S', 'Deng, R', 'Novakovic, V A', 'Bi, Y', 'Kou, J', 'Yu, B', 'Yang, S', 'Wang, J', 'Zhou, J', 'Shi, J']","['Ma R', 'Li T', 'Cao M', 'Si Y', 'Wu X', 'Zhao L', 'Yao Z', 'Zhang Y', 'Fang S', 'Deng R', 'Novakovic VA', 'Bi Y', 'Kou J', 'Yu B', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Zhou J', 'Shi J']",,"['Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', ""Department of Research, Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."", 'Department of Cardiology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Cardiology of the Second Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'The Key Laboratory of Myocardial Ischemia, Ministry of Education, Heilongjiang Province, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the Second Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', 'Department of Hematology of the First Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China.', ""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160630,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.21.36 (Pancreatic Elastase)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Atg7 protein, human)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Autophagy-Related Protein 7)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', '*Autophagy/drug effects', 'Autophagy-Related Protein 7/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Traps/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancreatic Elastase/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC5108337,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/10/11 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/10/11 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis2016186 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2016.186 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2016 Jun 30;7(6):e2283. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2016.186.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no standardized preventive treatment for childhood FN, and information on C-reactive protein (CRP) elevation in afebrile patients with neutropenia (CEAN) is limited. The aim of this study was therefore to identify the association between CEAN and FN onset, and evaluate the efficacy of broad-spectrum antibiotics for FN prophylaxis. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 22 consecutive pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies (acute myeloid leukemia, n = 2; acute lymphoid leukemia, n = 20) admitted to the present institution between 2006 and 2011. CEAN was defined as CRP elevation >/=0.05 mg/dL between the two most recent blood tests with no fever. We identified CEAN before FN onset, and assessed the efficacy of broad-spectrum antibiotics for FN prevention in CEAN. FN incidence within 48 h after CEAN detection was compared between prophylactic and non-prophylactic episodes. RESULTS: CEAN was observed before FN onset in 20 (55.6%), of 36 FN episodes. Among the 95 analyzed CEAN episodes, broad-spectrum antibiotics had been used for 30 episodes (prophylactic episodes), whereas these antibiotics had not been used in 60 episodes (non-prophylactic episodes). Prophylactic episodes had a significantly lower FN incidence than non-prophylactic episodes (6.7% and 31%, respectively, P < 0.01) within 48 h after CEAN detection. Bacteremia was observed in three non-prophylactic episodes. CONCLUSION: Patients with CEAN are at higher risk of FN, and physicians may consider the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to prevent FN development.",['(c) 2016 Japan Pediatric Society.'],"['Sugiura, Shiro', 'Ito, Tsuyoshi', 'Koyama, Norihisa', 'Sasaki, Noriko', 'Ikai, Hiroshi', 'Imanaka, Yuichi']","['Sugiura S', 'Ito T', 'Koyama N', 'Sasaki N', 'Ikai H', 'Imanaka Y']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toyohashi Municipal Hospital, Toyohashi, Aichi, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160921,Australia,Pediatr Int,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,100886002,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '9007-41-4 (C-Reactive Protein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'C-Reactive Protein/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*blood/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/05/11 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/31 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ped.13077 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Int. 2017 Jan;59(1):23-28. doi: 10.1111/ped.13077.

Because studies regarding the effects of dexamethasone are limited by their small scale, we prospectively studied the direct effects of treating pediatric ALL with dexamethasone administration with respect to activation of components of metabolic syndrome (MetS); in addition, we investigated whether these side effects were correlated with the level of dexamethasone. Fifty pediatric patients (3-16 years of age) with ALL were studied during a 5-day dexamethasone course during the maintenance phase of the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group ALL-10 and ALL-11 protocols. Fasting insulin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, and triglycerides levels were measured at baseline (before the start of dexamethasone; T1) and on the fifth day of treatment (T2). Dexamethasone trough levels were measured at T2. We found that dexamethasone treatment significantly increased the following fasting serum levels (P<0.05): HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. In addition, dexamethasone increased insulin resistance (HOMA-IR>3.4) from 8% to 85% (P<0.01). Dexamethasone treatment also significantly increased the diastolic and systolic blood pressure. Lastly, dexamethasone trough levels (N = 24) were directly correlated with high glucose levels at T2, but not with other parameters. These results indicate that dexamethasone treatment acutely induces three components of the MetS. Together with the weight gain typically associated with dexamethasone treatment, these factors may contribute to the higher prevalence of MetS and cardiovascular risk among survivors of childhood leukemia who received dexamethasone treatment.",,"['Warris, Lidewij T', 'van den Akker, Erica L T', 'Bierings, Marc B', 'van den Bos, Cor', 'Zwaan, Christian M', 'Sassen, Sebastiaan D T', 'Tissing, Wim J E', 'Veening, Margreet A', 'Pieters, Rob', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M']","['Warris LT', 'van den Akker EL', 'Bierings MB', 'van den Bos C', 'Zwaan CM', 'Sassen SD', 'Tissing WJ', 'Veening MA', 'Pieters R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM']",,"[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Endocrinology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Utrecht - Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Academic Medical Center - Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Groningen Medical Center, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20160630,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Insulin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/metabolism', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Syndrome/chemically induced/*diagnosis/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Weight Gain']",PMC4928792,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/07/27 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0158225 [doi]', 'PONE-D-16-06004 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2016 Jun 30;11(6):e0158225. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0158225. eCollection 2016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activating mutations of SHP2 have been associated with developmental pathologies such as Noonan syndrome and are found in multiple cancer types, including leukaemia, lung and breast cancer and neuroblastoma. SHP2 is ubiquitously expressed and regulates cell survival and proliferation primarily through activation of the RAS-ERK signalling pathway. It is also a key mediator of the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) immune checkpoint pathways. Reduction of SHP2 activity suppresses tumour cell growth and is a potential target of cancer therapy. Here we report the discovery of a highly potent (IC50 = 0.071 muM), selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule SHP2 inhibitor, SHP099, that stabilizes SHP2 in an auto-inhibited conformation. SHP099 concurrently binds to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and protein tyrosine phosphatase domains, thus inhibiting SHP2 activity through an allosteric mechanism. SHP099 suppresses RAS-ERK signalling to inhibit the proliferation of receptor-tyrosine-kinase-driven human cancer cells in vitro and is efficacious in mouse tumour xenograft models.

However, these genes did not evolve individually: gene expression is controlled by a complex network of interactions, and alterations in one gene may drive reciprocal changes in its proteins' binding partners. Like many complex networks, these gene regulatory networks (GRNs) are composed of communities, or clusters of genes with relatively high connectivity. A deep understanding of the relationship between the evolutionary history of single genes and the topological properties of the underlying GRN is integral to evolutionary genetics. Here, we show that the topological properties of an acute myeloid leukemia GRN and a general human GRN are strongly coupled with its genes' evolutionary properties. Slowly evolving (""cold""), old genes tend to interact with each other, as do rapidly evolving (""hot""), young genes. This naturally causes genes to segregate into community structures with relatively homogeneous evolutionary histories. We argue that gene duplication placed old, cold genes and communities at the center of the networks, and young, hot genes and communities at the periphery. We demonstrate this with single-node centrality measures and two new measures of efficiency, the set efficiency and the interset efficiency. We conclude that these methods for studying the relationships between a GRN's community structures and its genes' evolutionary properties provide new perspectives for understanding evolutionary genetics.",,"['Szedlak, Anthony', 'Smith, Nicholas', 'Liu, Li', 'Paternostro, Giovanni', 'Piermarocchi, Carlo']","['Szedlak A', 'Smith N', 'Liu L', 'Paternostro G', 'Piermarocchi C']",,"['Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States of America.', 'Salgomed Inc., Del Mar, California, United States of America.', 'College of Health Solutions, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona, United States of America.', 'Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, United States of America.']",['eng'],['R41 CA174059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20160630,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,,IM,"['Computational Biology', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', '*Models, Genetic']",PMC4928929,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005009 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-16-00204 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2016 Jun 30;12(6):e1005009. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005009. eCollection 2016 Jun.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Known chromosomal changes causing MDS include deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5, runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) also known as acute myeloid leukemia 1 protein (AML1), and very rarely fusion genes involving RUNX1 at t(5;21)(q15;q22). We present a case of a 71-year-old female with MDS, refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1, with a combination of two cytogenetic abnormalities, specifically a concomitant translocation between chromosomes 5q15 and 21q22 and deletion of chromosome 5q13q33. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) using a probe for RUNX1 (AML1), localized to 21q22, showed three FISH signals for RUNX1, consistent with rearrangement of RUNX1. Therapy was started with Lenalidomide leading to normal blood counts. Most significantly, repeat cytogenetics revealed normal karyotype and resolution of deletion on the long arm of chromosome 5 and a t(5;21). FISH negative for deletion 5q. The results altogether meet criteria for a complete cytogenetic remission (CR). We report a new case of t(5;21)(q15;q22) involving the RUNX1 gene and del(5)(q13q33) in a MDS patient, a combination of chromosomal abnormalities heretofore not reported in the literature. RUNX1 rearrangement is usually associated with an adverse prognosis in AML and MDS. Deletions of 5q are typically associated with poor prognosis in AML, however it is usually associated with a favorable prognosis in MDS. Our patient responded very well to Lenalidomide therapy with achievement of CR. Lenalidomide is approved for treatment of anemia in low and intermediate risk MDS with del (5q), however based on a search of literature it seems that RUNX1 mutations are also more prominent in patients who have responded to Lenalidomide therapy. MDS is a genomically unstable disease. Hence, it is conceivable that our patient started with a 5q minus syndrome and then acquired the second hit RUNX1 translocation leading to an accelerated phase of myeloid neoplasm or refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 1. Hence, the temporal relationship between acquisition of del 5q and RUNX1 rearrangement may have influenced the clinical outcome and possibly response to therapy.",,"['Kasi Loknath Kumar, Anup', 'Weckbaugh, Brandon', 'Sirridge, Christopher', 'Woodroof, Janet', 'Persons, Diane', 'Kambhampati, Suman']","['Kasi Loknath Kumar A', 'Weckbaugh B', 'Sirridge C', 'Woodroof J', 'Persons D', 'Kambhampati S']",,"['1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', '1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', '1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', '1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', '1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.', '1 Division of Oncology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 2 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Kansas Medical Center, Mailstop 2027, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA ; 3 Division of Hematology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 2330 Shawnee Mission Parkway, Westwood, KS 66205, USA ; 4 Division of Pathology, University of Kansas Medical Center, 3901 Rainbow Boulevard, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160223,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,,PMC4923670,2016/07/01 06:00,2016/07/01 06:01,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.2306-9759.2016.02.01 [doi]', 'sci-03-2016.02.01 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2016 Feb 23;3:3. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2306-9759.2016.02.01. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['Deletion 5q', 'Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS)', 'lenalidomide', 'runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The disease is characterized by a single, pathognomonic molecular event, consisting of the translocation t(15;17) which gives rise to the PML/retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) hybrid protein. The development of this leukemia is mainly related to the fusion oncoprotein PML/RARalpha, acting as an altered RAR mediating abnormal signalling and repression of myeloid differentiation, with consequent accumulation of undifferentiated promyelocytes. The prognosis of APL has dramatically been improved with the introduction in therapy of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO). The main effect of these two drugs is linked to the targeting of either RAR moiety of the PML/RARalpha molecule and induction of cell differentiation (ATRA) or of the PML moiety of the fusion protein and induction of leukemic cell apoptosis, including leukemic progenitors (mostly induced by ATO). These two drugs exhibited excellent synergism and determine a very high rate of durable remissions in low/intermediate-risk APLs, when administered in the absence of any chemotherapeutic drug. The strong synergism and the marked clinical efficacy of these two agents when administered together seem to be related to their capacity to induce PML/RARalpha degradation and complete eradication of leukemia stem cells.",,"['Testa, Ugo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Testa U', 'Lo-Coco F']",,"['1 Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy ; 2 Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" and Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', '1 Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy ; 2 Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome ""Tor Vergata"" and Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20150429,China,Stem Cell Investig,Stem cell investigation,101672113,,,,PMC4923659,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2015/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.3978/j.issn.2306-9759.2015.04.03 [doi]', 'sci-02-2015.04.03 [pii]']",epublish,Stem Cell Investig. 2015 Apr 29;2:8. doi: 10.3978/j.issn.2306-9759.2015.04.03. eCollection 2015.,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)', 'apoptosis', 'differentiation', 'leukemia-initiating cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Soon after this initial finding, XMRV was also detected in samples from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). The blood community, which is highly sensitive to the threat of emerging infectious diseases since the HIV/AIDS crisis, recommended indefinite deferral of all blood donors with a history of CFS. As XMRV research progressed, conflicting results emerged regarding the importance of this virus in the pathophysiology of prostate cancer and/or CFS. Molecular biologists traced the development of XMRV to a recombination event in a laboratory mouse that likely occurred circa 1993. The virus was propagated via cell lines derived from a tumor present in this mouse and spread through contamination of laboratory samples. Well-controlled experiments showed that detection of XMRV was due to contaminated samples and was not a marker of or a causal factor in prostate cancer or CFS. This paper traces the development of XMRV in the prostate and CFS scientific communities and explores the effect it had on the blood community.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

However, considering the molecular complexity of AML, it is unlikely that AML can be cured with monotherapy. Therefore, we asked whether adding already established effective drugs such as topoisomerase (Topo) II inhibitors to selinexor will enhance its anti-leukemic effects in AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The efficacy of combinatorial drug treatment using Topo II inhibitors (idarubicin, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide) and selinexor was evaluated in established cellular and animal models of AML. RESULTS: Concomitant treatment with selinexor and Topo II inhibitors resulted in therapeutic synergy in AML cell lines and patient samples. Using a xenograft MV4-11 AML mouse model, we show that treatment with selinexor and idarubicin significantly prolongs survival of leukemic mice compared with each single therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Aberrant nuclear export and cytoplasmic localization of Topo IIalpha has been identified as one of the mechanisms leading to drug resistance in cancer. Here, we show that in a subset of patients with AML that express cytoplasmic Topo IIalpha, selinexor treatment results in nuclear retention of Topo IIalpha protein, resulting in increased sensitivity to idarubicin. Selinexor treatment of AML cells resulted in a c-MYC-dependent reduction of DNA damage repair genes (Rad51 and Chk1) mRNA and protein expression and subsequent inhibition of homologous recombination repair and increased sensitivity to Topo II inhibitors. The preclinical data reported here support further clinical studies using selinexor and Topo II inhibitors in combination to treat AML. Clin Cancer Res; 22(24); 6142-52.

Although some HDACi have entered the clinic, the mechanism(s) underlying their tumor selectivity are poorly understood.Experimental Design and Results: Using gene expression analysis, we define a core set of six genes commonly regulated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and cell lines. MYC, the most prominently modulated, is preferentially altered in leukemia. Upon HDACi treatment, c-Myc is acetylated at lysine 323 and its expression decreases, leading to TRAIL activation and apoptosis. c-Myc binds to the TRAIL promoter on the proximal GC box through SP1 or MIZ1, impairing TRAIL activation. HDACi exposure triggers TRAIL expression, altering c-Myc-TRAIL binding. These events do not occur in normal cells. Excitingly, this inverse correlation between TRAIL and c-Myc is supported by HDACi treatment ex vivo of AML blasts and primary human breast cancer cells. The predictive value of c-Myc to HDACi responsiveness is confirmed in vivo in AML patients undergoing HDACi-based clinical trials.Conclusions: Collectively, our findings identify a key role for c-Myc in TRAIL deregulation and as a biomarker of the anticancer action of HDACi in AML.

Bone marrow-derived cues influence many elements of both steady state hematopoiesis and hematopoietic tumor cell phenotypes through modulation of gene expression. miRNAs are one regulatory class of small noncoding RNAs that have been shown to be increasingly important in diverse settings of malignancy. In the current study, miRNA profiles were globally altered in ALL cells following exposure to primary human bone marrow niche cells, including bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) and primary human osteoblasts (HOB). Specifically, mature miR-221 and miR-222 transcripts were decreased in ALL cells cocultured with BMSC or HOB, coincident with increased p27 (CDKN1B), a previously validated target. Increased p27 protein in ALL cells exposed to BMSC or HOB is consistent with accumulation of tumor cells in the G0 phase of the cell cycle and resistance to chemotherapy-induced death. Overexpression of miR-221 in ALL cells during BMSC or HOB coculture prompted cell-cycle progression and sensitization of ALL cells to cytotoxic agents, blunting the protective influence of the BMM. These novel observations indicate that BMM regulation of miR-221/222 contributes to marrow niche-supported tumor cell quiescence and survival of residual cells. IMPLICATIONS: Niche-influenced miR-221/222 may define a novel therapeutic target in ALL to be combined with existing cytotoxic agents to more effectively eradicate refractory disease that contributes to relapse.

While traditional chemoimmunotherapy still remains a mainstay for young, fit patients, a number of novel targeted therapies have emerged that have changed the therapeutic landscape. Two innovative anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, obinutuzumab and ofatumomamab, have demonstrated activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent well-tolerated options in upfront management of elderly patients or in those with significant comorbidities. Agents targeting the B-cell receptor pathway, ibrutinib and idelalisib, have excellent activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly in those patients with 17p deletions, in which responses to chemoimmunotherapy are traditionally dismal. Venetoclax (ABT-199), the recently FDA-approved BCL2 inhibitor, as well as several other agents and therapy combinations in the pipeline offer great promise for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, particularly in the relapsed/refractory setting.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules that repress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this review, we summarize advanced investigations that underscore deregulated miRNA expression in MDS, and discuss the implications of miRNAs in the molecular pathogenesis of MDS. METHODS: Relevant English-language literatures were searched and retrieved from PubMed using the terms MDS and miRNAs. RESULTS: The majority of studies have focused on profiling miRNA expression in MDS, only a small number of studies have investigated the exact pathogenic role of miRNAs in MDS. DISCUSSION: In the hematopoietic system, miRNAs are critical regulators of the differentiation of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Thus, it is not surprising that dysregulation of miRNAs can lead to hematopoietic stem cell anomalies and further cause MDS. Deregulated miRNA expression has been identified in MDS, and it contributes to the pathogenesis and progression of MDS. Chromosomal aberrations, hypermethylation of miRNA promoters, and mutations of miRNA genes may lead to dysregulation of miRNA in MDS. However, the complex regulatory networks between miRNAs and their potential target genes in MDS still need to be explored in further studies. CONCLUSIONS: Although the function of miRNAs is not fully understood, these small non-coding RNAs represent novel pathogenetic and clinical implications in MDS. The studies of miRNAs may guide us towards a better understanding of this disease and shed light on the development of new therapeutic strategies.",,"['Kuang, Xingyi', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Kuang X', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']",,"['a Department of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing 400016 , PR China.', 'b The Center for the Study of Haematological Malignancies , 2032 Nicosia , Cyprus.', 'a Department of Hematology , The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing 400016 , PR China.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160630,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology']",,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2016.1193962 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2016 Dec;21(10):593-602. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2016.1193962.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether zinc carnosine (ZnC), a health-food product taken alone or in combination with bovine colostrum (a natural source of growth factors), would moderate such effects. DESIGN: Eight volunteers completed a 4-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover protocol (14 d of placebo, ZnC, colostrum, or ZnC plus colostrum) before undertaking standardized exercise 2 and 14 d after the start of treatment. Changes in epithelial resistance, apoptosis signaling molecules, and tight junction (TJ) protein phosphorylation in response to a 2 degrees C rise in body temperature were determined with the use of Caco-2 and HT29 intestinal cells. RESULTS: Body temperature increased 2 degrees C, and gut permeability (5-h urinary lactulose:rhamnose ratios) increased 3-fold after exercise (from 0.32 +/- 0.016 baseline to 1.0 +/- 0.017 at 14 d; P < 0.01). ZnC or colostrum truncated the rise by 70% after 14 d of treatment. The combination treatment gave an additional benefit, and truncated exercise induced increase at 2 d (30% reduction; P < 0.01). A 2 degrees C temperature rise in in vitro studies caused the doubling of apoptosis and reduced epithelial resistance 3-4-fold. ZnC or colostrum truncated these effects (35-50%) with the greatest response seen with the combination treatment (all P < 0.01). Mechanisms of action included increasing heat shock protein 70 and truncating temperature-induced changes in B cell leukemia/lymphoma-2 associated X protein alpha and B cell lymphoma 2. ZnC also increased total occludin and reduced phosphorylated tyrosine claudin, phosphorylated tyrosine occludin, and phosphorylated serine occludin, thereby enhancing the TJ formation and stabilization. CONCLUSION: ZnC, taken alone or with colostrum, increased epithelial resistance and the TJ structure and may have value for athletes and in the prevention of heat stroke in military personnel.

METHODS: All data were collected manually from patient medical records at each of the study sites and from official censuses. CLL prevalence and incidence were determined from a count of CLL cases (previously diagnosed and new cases) in the population who made at least one clinic visit for CLL during the period from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013. RESULTS: The recorded cumulative 5-year incidence of CLL during the study ranged from 1.46 per 100 000 persons (95% CI: 0.85-2.34) in Yekaterinburg, Russia, to 4.34 per 100 000 persons (95% CI: 2.48-7.04) in Luhansk, Ukraine. In 2013, the lowest prevalence of CLL was also recorded in Yekaterinburg: 7.11 per 100 000 persons (95% CI: 5.67-8.81).

However, the application to a variety of cancer entities is often constricted by the non-availability of a single chain antibody (scFv), which is usually the targeting domain in a CAR, while antibodies in the natural format are often available. To overcome the limitation, we designed a CAR that uses an antibody in its natural configuration for binding. Such CAR consists of two chains, the immunoglobulin light and heavy chain with their constant regions, whereby the heavy chain is anchored to the membrane and linked to an intracellular signalling domain for T-cell activation. The two chains form a stable heterodimer, a so-called dual chain CAR (dcCAR), and bind with high affinity and in a specific manner to their cognate antigen. By specific binding, the dcCAR activates engineered T cells for the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and for target cell lysis. We provide evidence by three examples that the dcCAR format is universally applicable and thereby broadens the CAR cell therapy towards a larger variety of targets for which an scFv antibody is not available.",,"['Faitschuk, E', 'Nagy, V', 'Hombach, A A', 'Abken, H']","['Faitschuk E', 'Nagy V', 'Hombach AA', 'Abken H']",,"['Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160614,England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/*methods', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*genetics/immunology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/genetics/immunology']",,2016/07/01 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['gt201648 [pii]', '10.1038/gt.2016.48 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2016 Oct;23(10):718-726. doi: 10.1038/gt.2016.48.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical HSCT (haplo-HSCT) or umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) are both important alternative sources of stem cells for those without an HLA-identical sibling donor or unrelated matched donor. We aimed to compare the therapeutic effects of single UCBT and unmanipulated haplo-HSCT in high-risk ALL children (n = 129). Hematopoietic recovery was significantly faster in haplo-HSCT recipients than in UCBT recipients. The 2-year cumulative incidences of relapse in the haplo-HSCT and UCBT groups were 16.1% and 24.1%, respectively (p = 0.169). The 2-year cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality in the haplo-HSCT and UCBT groups were 12.8% and 18.8%, respectively (p = 0.277). The 2-year probabilities of overall survival in the haplo-HSCT and UCBT groups were 82.0% and 69.6%, respectively (p = 0.071), and the 2-year probability of disease-free survival in the haplo-HSCT group was higher than in the UCBT group (71.0% vs. 57.2%, p = 0.040). However, several variables (such as leukocyte count and cytogenetics at diagnosis) were different between the groups, and a possible center effect should also be considered. In addition, only mild and moderate chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was associated with significantly improved survival compared to those without chronic GVHD in multivariate analysis.

In this study, we sought to investigate-in parallel comparative analyses-Gag cellular distribution, VLP size, and basic morphological features using Gag expression constructs (Gag or Gag-YFP, where YFP is yellow fluorescent protein) created from all representative retroviral genera: Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus, Deltaretrovirus, Epsilonretrovirus, Gammaretrovirus, Lentivirus, and Spumavirus. We analyzed Gag cellular distribution by confocal microscopy, VLP budding by thin-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and general morphological features of the VLPs by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Punctate Gag was observed near the plasma membrane for all Gag constructs tested except for the representative Beta- and Epsilonretrovirus Gag proteins. This is the first report of Epsilonretrovirus Gag localizing to the nucleus of HeLa cells. While VLPs were not produced by the representative Beta- and Epsilonretrovirus Gag proteins, the other Gag proteins produced VLPs as confirmed by TEM, and morphological differences were observed by cryo-TEM. In particular, we observed Deltaretrovirus-like particles with flat regions of electron density that did not follow viral membrane curvature, Lentivirus-like particles with a narrow range and consistent electron density, suggesting a tightly packed Gag lattice, and Spumavirus-like particles with large envelope protein spikes and no visible electron density associated with a Gag lattice. Taken together, these parallel comparative analyses demonstrate for the first time the distinct morphological features that exist among retrovirus-like particles. Investigation of these differences will provide greater insights into the retroviral assembly pathway. IMPORTANCE: Comparative analysis among retroviruses has been critically important in enhancing our understanding of retroviral replication and pathogenesis, including that of important human pathogens such as human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HIV-1. In this study, parallel comparative analyses have been used to study Gag expression and virus-like particle morphology among representative retroviruses in the known retroviral genera. Distinct differences were observed, which enhances current knowledge of the retroviral assembly pathway.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

The rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) shares many key biological features with the closely related Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; human herpesvirus 8) and readily infects cells of both human and rhesus monkey origin. We used the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat-Cas9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technique to generate knockout (ko) cells for each of the four ND10 components, PML, SP100, DAXX, and ATRX. These ko cells were analyzed with regard to permissiveness for RRV infection. In addition, we analyzed the fate of the individual ND10 components in infected cells by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Knockout of the ND10 component DAXX markedly increased RRV infection, while knockout of PML or SP100 had a less pronounced effect. In line with these observations, RRV infection resulted in rapid degradation of SP100, followed by degradation of PML and the loss of ND10 structures, whereas the protein levels of ATRX and DAXX remained constant. Notably, inhibition of the proteasome but not inhibition of de novo gene expression prevented the loss of SP100 and PML in cells that did not support lytic replication, compatible with proteasomal degradation of these ND10 components through the action of a viral tegument protein. Expression of the RRV FGARAT homolog ORF75 was sufficient to effect the loss of SP100 and PML in transfected or transduced cells, implicating ORF75 as the viral effector protein. IMPORTANCE: Our findings highlight the antiviral role of ND10 and its individual components and further establish the viral FGARAT homologs of the gammaherpesviruses to be important viral effectors that counteract ND10-instituted intrinsic immunity. Surprisingly, even closely related viruses like KSHV and RRV evolved to use different strategies to evade ND10-mediated restriction. RRV first targets SP100 for degradation and then targets PML with a delayed kinetic, a strategy which clearly differs from that of other gammaherpesviruses. Despite efficient degradation of these two major ND10 components, RRV is still restricted by DAXX, another abundant ND10 component, as evidenced by a marked increase in RRV infection and replication upon knockout of DAXX. Taken together, our findings substantiate PML, SP100, and DAXX as key antiviral proteins, in that the first two are targeted for degradation by RRV and the last one still potently restricts replication of RRV.","['Copyright (c) 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

Here, we reported a T-ALL case who experienced three relapses and received HSCT and DLI with an overall survival (OS) time lasting for more than seven years. Based on our previous identification of a leukemic and reactive clone in this patient, continual gammadelta T cell repertoire monitoring affirmed that the same Vdelta5 leukemic clone existed in most samples from the patient, particularly including a sample taken at the time of the third T-ALL relapse, while it could not be detected in the donor sample. In addition, an identical Vdelta4 monoclonal T cell that proliferated in the recipient for several years was confirmed to come from the donor graft, and its expression level significantly increased in third leukemia recurrence. These results indicate that clonally expanded Vdelta4 T cells may represent a reconstituted gammadelta T cell repertoire after HSCT, which also hints to a relatively better outcome for this case. Based on this case study, we recommend DLI should be as a treatment strategy for patients who achieve CR or relapse from HSCT.

It is generally refractory to chemotherapy, which contributes to its poor prognosis. The reversal of chemoresistance is a major clinical challenge to improve the prognostic outcome of osteosarcoma patients. We developed a tumor-specific replication-competent oncolytic adenovirus, OBP-301 (telomelysin) and assessed its synergistic effects with chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin and doxorubicin) using human osteosarcoma cell lines and a xenograft tumor model. The molecular mechanism underlying the chemosensitizing effect of OBP-301 was evaluated in aspects of apoptosis induction. OBP-301 inhibits anti-apoptotic myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) expression, which in turn leads to chemosensitization in human osteosarcoma cells. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of MCL1 expression sensitized human osteosarcoma cells to common chemotherapeutic agents. We also found that upregulation of microRNA-29 targeting MCL1 via virally induced transcriptional factor E2F-1 activation was critical for the enhancement of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. Telomerase-specific oncolytic adenovirus synergistically suppressed the viability of human osteosarcoma cells in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. The combination treatment also significantly inhibited tumor growth, as compared to monotherapy, in an osteosarcoma xenograft tumor model. Our data suggest that replicative virus-mediated tumor-specific MCL1 ablation may be a promising strategy to attenuate chemoresistance in osteosarcoma patients.",,"['Osaki, Shuhei', 'Tazawa, Hiroshi', 'Hasei, Joe', 'Yamakawa, Yasuaki', 'Omori, Toshinori', 'Sugiu, Kazuhisa', 'Komatsubara, Tadashi', 'Fujiwara, Tomohiro', 'Sasaki, Tsuyoshi', 'Kunisada, Toshiyuki', 'Yoshida, Aki', 'Urata, Yasuo', 'Kagawa, Shunsuke', 'Ozaki, Toshifumi', 'Fujiwara, Toshiyoshi']","['Osaki S', 'Tazawa H', 'Hasei J', 'Yamakawa Y', 'Omori T', 'Sugiu K', 'Komatsubara T', 'Fujiwara T', 'Sasaki T', 'Kunisada T', 'Yoshida A', 'Urata Y', 'Kagawa S', 'Ozaki T', 'Fujiwara T']",,"['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Center for Innovative Clinical Medicine, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Materials for Musculoskeletal Reconstruction, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Oncolys BioPharma, Inc., Tokyo 105-0001, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Okayama University, Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160630,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN29a microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Adenoviridae/genetics/growth & development', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Oncolytic Viruses/genetics/growth & development', 'Osteosarcoma/pathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC4928055,2016/07/01 06:00,2018/07/04 06:00,['2016/07/01 06:00'],"['2016/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/07/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['srep28953 [pii]', '10.1038/srep28953 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2016 Jun 30;6:28953. doi: 10.1038/srep28953.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 325 CLL patients were included in the study. Screening for NOTCH1 c.7544_7545delCT was performed using conventional PCR-based amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) method. All 33 samples harboring c.7544_7545delCT allele and 5 negative cases as control were submitted to real-time PCR. RESULTS: Specificity and sensitivity of two PCR techniques were comparable. NOTCH1 c.7544_7545delCT mutation was found by ARMS in 10.1% of CLL patients, which is consistent with the data of other studies. However, the results of ARMS PCR in a minority of cases (2.15%) were doubtful and required reinvestigation. Real-time PCR, being less time-consuming, showed advantage in the assessment of the amplification's specificity (using the melting curve analysis). It also allows the quantitative assessment of NOTCH1-mutated clone. CONCLUSION: NOTCH1 c.7544_7545delCT mutation resulting in removal of the C-terminal PEST domain, deregulation of NOTCH1-dependent signaling pathways, has negative influence on prognosis of CLL and efficiency of therapy with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies.

However, expression of CD150 is rather limited on the surface of malignant B cells with the block of differentiation at the different stages of maturation. The aim of our work was to explore CD150 expression both on protein and mRNA levels with the emphasis on CD150 isoforms in malignant B-cell lines at the different stages of maturation in comparison with their normal B cell counterparts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were performed on normal tonsillar B-cell subpopulations, B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, malignant B-cell lines of different origin, including pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Protein CD150 expression was assessed by western blot analysis and the expression level of CD150 isoforms was evaluated using qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Despite the similar CD150 expression both on mRNA and protein levels in normal B-cell subsets and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, malignant B-cell lines demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in CD150 expression. Only Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines, Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BJAB and Raji, and also pre-B cell line BLIN-1 expressed CD150 protein. At the same time total CD150 and mCD150 mRNA was detected in all studied cell lines excluding pre-B cell line REH. The minor sCD150 isoform was found only in Hodgkin's lymphoma cell lines and Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Raji. The nCD150 isoform was broadly expressed in tested B cell lines with exception of REH and Daudi. CONCLUSION: Malignant B-cell lines at the different stages of maturation only partially resemble their normal counterparts by CD150 expression. In malignant B-cell lines, CD150 expression on mRNA level is much broader than on protein level. CD150 isoforms are differentially expressed in normal and malignant B cells with predominant expression of mCD150 isoform.",,"['Gordiienko, I M', 'Shlapatska, L M', 'Kovalevska, L M', 'Sidorenko, S P']","['Gordiienko IM', 'Shlapatska LM', 'Kovalevska LM', 'Sidorenko SP']",,"['Laboratory of Signal Transduction Pathways, R.E.

METHODS: Cell viability was assessed by MTT test. Light-emitting diode lamp (lambda = 410-700 nm, 2.45 J/cm(2) ) was used for C60 fullerene photoexcitation. Nitrite level and NO-synthase activity were measured by Griess reaction and by conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline, respectively. p38 MAPK activity was assessed by Western blot analysis. Cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry. RESULTS: It was shown that light irradiation of C60 fullerene-treated L1210 cells was accompanied by 55% decrease of their viability at 48 h of culture. Nitrite level measured as an index of reactive NO generation was increased at the early period after C60 fullerene photoexcitation due to activation of both constitutive and inducible NO-synthase isoforms. The simultaneous activation of p38 MAPK was detected. Accumulation of L1210 cells in sub-G1 phase of cell cycle was observed after C60 fullerene photoexcitation.

The standardized incidence rates are presented for a 27-y period after the exposure. For 2007-2012 period, the authors have identified the incident CLL cases in an enlarged cohort of 152,520 persons by linkage of the cohort file with the Ukrainian National Cancer Registry (NCRU). CLL data for the previous period (1987-2006) were identified in a frame of the Ukrainian-American leukemia study in the original cohort of 110,645 male clean-up workers. A significant CLL incidence excess was shown for the entire study period 1987-2012, with more prominent levels for the earliest years (1987-1996) when the standardized incidence rate (SIR) value was estimated to be 3.61 with 95% confidence interval from 2.32 to 4.91. In 2007-2012, the CLL incidence decreased substantially but still exceeded the national level although not significantly. In parallel, the several studies were performed at the National Research Center for Radiation Medicine (NRCRM) to explore if any clinical and cytogenetic features of CLL existed in the clean-up workers. The clinical study included 80 exposed and 70 unexposed CLL cases. Among the major clinical differences of the CLL course in the clean-up workers were a shorter period of white blood cells (WBC) doubling (10.7 vs. 18.0; p<0.001), frequent infectious episodes, lymphoadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly (37 vs. 16), higher expression for CD38, and lower expression for ZAP-70 antigen.",,"['Bazyka, Dimitry', 'Gudzenko, Natalya', 'Dyagil, Iryna', 'Goroh, Eugeny', 'Polyschuk, Oksana', 'Trotsuk, Natalya', 'Babkina, Nataly', 'Romanenko, Anatoly']","['Bazyka D', 'Gudzenko N', 'Dyagil I', 'Goroh E', 'Polyschuk O', 'Trotsuk N', 'Babkina N', 'Romanenko A']",,"['*National Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Ukraine (RCRM); daggerNational Cancer Registry of Ukraine (NCRU).']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cohort Studies', 'Decontamination/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/06/20 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000000440 [doi]', '00004032-201608000-00016 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2016 Aug;111(2):186-91. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000000440.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here present an overview of the role of MSCs in the pathogenesis of MDS, with emphasis on cellular interactions in the BM microenvironment and related stem cell niche concepts. MSCs have potent immunomodulatory capacities and communicate with diverse immune cells, but also interact with various other cellular components of the microenvironment as well as with normal and leukemic stem and progenitor cells. Moreover, compared to normal MSCs, MSCs in MDS and AML often exhibit altered gene expression profiles, an aberrant phenotype, and abnormal functional properties. These alterations supposedly contribute to the ""reprogramming"" of the stem cell niche into a disease-permissive microenvironment where an altered immune system, abnormal stem cell niche interactions, and an impaired growth control lead to disease progression. The current article also reviews molecular targets that play a role in such cellular interactions and possibilities to interfere with abnormal stem cell niche interactions by using specific targeted drugs.",,"['Pleyer, Lisa', 'Valent, Peter', 'Greil, Richard']","['Pleyer L', 'Valent P', 'Greil R']",,"['3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.', 'Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials at Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.', '3rd Medical Department, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. l.pleyer@salk.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology &amp; Ludwig Boltzmann Cluster Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, 1090 Vienna, Austria. peter.valent@meduniwien.ac.at.', '3rd Medical Department with Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hemostaseology, Rheumatology and Infectious Diseases, Laboratory for Immunological and Molecular Cancer Research, Oncologic Center, Paracelsus Medical University Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. r.greil@salk.at.', 'Center for Clinical Cancer and Immunology Trials at Salzburg Cancer Research Institute, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. r.greil@salk.at.', '3rd Medical Department, Cancer Cluster Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria. r.greil@salk.at.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160627,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Niche']",PMC4964385,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/03/25 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms17071009 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms17071009 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2016 Jun 27;17(7). pii: ijms17071009. doi: 10.3390/ijms17071009.,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'bone marrow stem cell niche', 'endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition', 'immunomodulation', 'leukemic niche', 'mesenchymal stem cells (MSC)', 'microenvironment', 'myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)', 'neoplastic stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin inhibits KIT D816V, a primary driver of disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We conducted an open-label study of oral midostaurin at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in 116 patients, of whom 89 with mastocytosis-related organ damage were eligible for inclusion in the primary efficacy population; 16 had aggressive systemic mastocytosis, 57 had systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and 16 had mast-cell leukemia. The primary outcome was the best overall response. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 70); 45% of the patients had a major response, which was defined as complete resolution of at least one type of mastocytosis-related organ damage. Response rates were similar regardless of the subtype of advanced systemic mastocytosis, KIT mutation status, or exposure to previous therapy. The median best percentage changes in bone marrow mast-cell burden and serum tryptase level were -59% and -58%, respectively. The median overall survival was 28.7 months, and the median progression-free survival was 14.1 months. Among the 16 patients with mast-cell leukemia, the median overall survival was 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to not estimated). Dose reduction owing to toxic effects occurred in 56% of the patients; re-escalation to the starting dose was feasible in 32% of those patients. The most frequent adverse events were low-grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. New or worsening grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 24%, 41%, and 29% of the patients, respectively, mostly in those with preexisting cytopenias. CONCLUSIONS: In this open-label study, midostaurin showed efficacy in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including the highly fatal variant mast-cell leukemia.

So far no mechanistic bases for these differential associations have been demonstrated. We speculate that developmental origin of B-cells might propose a mechanistic rationale for their carcinogenic response to autoimmune stimuli and tested the hypothesis on our previous studies on the risks of B-cell neoplasms after any of 33 ADs. We found that predominantly germinal center (GC)-derived B-cells showed multiple associations with ADs: diffuse large B cell lymphoma associated with 15 ADs, follicular lymphoma with 7 ADs and Hodgkin lymphoma with 11 ADs. Notably, these neoplasms shared significant associations with 5 ADs (immune thrombocytopenic purpura, polymyositis/dermatomyositis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosis). By contrast, primarily non-GC neoplasms, acute lymphocytic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and myeloma associated with 2 ADs only and mantle cell lymphoma with 1 AD. None of the neoplasms shared associated ADs.

Recurrent mutations in IDH1 or IDH2 are prevalent in several cancers including glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cholangiocarcinoma and chondrosarcoma. The mutated IDH1 and IDH2 proteins have a gain-of-function, neomorphic activity, catalyzing the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) by NADPH. Cancer-associated IDH mutations block normal cellular differentiation and promote tumorigenesis via the abnormal production of the oncometabolite 2-HG. High levels of 2-HG have been shown to inhibit alpha-KG dependent dioxygenases, including histone and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) demethylases, which play a key role in regulating the epigenetic state of cells. Current targeted inhibitors of IDH1 (AG120, IDH305), IDH2 (AG221), and pan-IDH1/2 (AG881) selectively inhibit mutant IDH protein and induce cell differentiation in in vitro and in vivo models. Preliminary results from phase I clinical trials with IDH inhibitors in patients with advanced hematologic malignancies have demonstrated an objective response rate ranging from 31% to 40% with durable responses (>1 year) observed.

Military veterans at the Nevada test site (NTS) during the SMOKY atmospheric nuclear weapons test in 1957 were reported to be at increased risk for leukemia in 1979, but this increase was not evaluated with respect to radiation dose. The SMOKY test was one of 30 tests in 1957 within the PLUMBBOB test series. These early studies led to public laws where atomic veterans could qualify for compensation for presumptive radiogenic diseases. A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 12219 veterans at the PLUMBBOB test series, including 3020 at the SMOKY nuclear test. Mortality follow-up was through 2010 and observed causes of death were compared with expected causes based on general population rates. Radiation dose to red bone marrow was based on individual dose reconstructions, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate dose response for all leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (non-CLL leukemia). Vital status was determined for 95.3% of the 12 219 veterans. The dose to red bone marrow was low (mean 3.2 mGy, maximum 500 mGy). Military participants at the PLUMBBOB nuclear test series remained relatively healthy after 53 years and died at a lower rate than the general population. In contrast, and in comparison with national rates, the SMOKY participants showed significant increases in all causes of death, respiratory cancer, leukemia, nephritis and nephrosis, and accidents, possibly related in part to lifestyle factors common to enlisted men who made up 81% of the SMOKY cohort. Compared with national rates, a statistically significant excess of non-CLL leukemia was observed among SMOKY participants (Standardized Mortality Ratio = 1.89, 95% 1.24-2.75, n = 27) but not among PLUMBBOB participants after excluding SMOKY (SMR = 0.87, 95% 0.64-1.51, n = 47). Leukemia risk, initially reported to be significantly increased among SMOKY participants, remained elevated, but this risk diminished over time. Despite an intense dose reconstruction, the risk for leukemia was not found to increase with increasing levels of radiation dose to the red bone marrow. Based on a linear model, the estimated excess relative risk per mGy is -0.05 (95% CI -0.14, 0.04). An explanation for the observed excess of leukemia remains unresolved but conceivably could be related to chance due to small numbers, subtle biases in the study design and/or high tobacco use among enlisted men. Larger studies should elucidate further the possible relationship between fallout radiation, leukemia and cancer among atomic veterans.",,"['Caldwell, Glyn G', 'Zack, Matthew M', 'Mumma, Michael T', 'Falk, Henry', 'Heath, Clark W', 'Till, John E', 'Chen, Heidi', 'Boice, John D']","['Caldwell GG', 'Zack MM', 'Mumma MT', 'Falk H', 'Heath CW', 'Till JE', 'Chen H', 'Boice JD']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.']",['eng'],"['CC999999/Intramural CDC HHS/United States', 'U01 CA137026/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160629,England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,['0 (Radioactive Fallout)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Compensation and Redress', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', '*Military Personnel', 'Nevada', '*Nuclear Weapons', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation, Ionizing', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC5115961,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/03/16 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/0952-4746/36/3/474 [doi]'],ppublish,J Radiol Prot. 2016 Sep;36(3):474-489. doi: 10.1088/0952-4746/36/3/474.

In a prospective study in a cohort of 272 adult patients (aged 18-65) and an independent validation cohort of 132 elderly adults (aged >60) with newly diagnosed AML, we assessed markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (fibrinogen, D-dimer, alpha-2-antiplasmin, antitrombin, prothrombin time, and platelet count) and the DIC score according the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis and their associations with the occurrence of venous and arterial thrombosis during follow-up. The prevalence of thrombosis was 8.7% (4.7% venous, 4.0% arterial) in the younger adults over a median follow-up of 478 days and 10.4% (4.4% venous, 5.9% arterial) in elderly patients. Most thrombotic events (66%) occurred before the start of the second course of chemotherapy. The calculated DIC score significantly predicted venous and arterial thrombosis with a hazard ratio (HR) for a high DIC score (>/=5) of 4.79 (1.71-13.45). These results were confirmed in the validation cohort of elderly patients with AML (HR 11.08 [3.23-38.06]). Among all DIC parameters, D-dimer levels are most predictive for thrombosis with an HR of 12.3 (3.39-42.64) in the first cohort and an HR of 7.82 (1.95-31.38) in validation cohort for a D-dimer >4 mg/L vs </=4 mg/L.

Highly AHR-expressing NB4 cells were cultured with SR1 for 2 and 4 days, and evaluated for viability and gene expression. DNA microarray was also performed. RESULTS: The viability of NB4 cells treated with 1.5 muM SR1 increased at day 4. Expression of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) was up-regulated, while that of BCL2 associated X protein (BAX) was down-regulated at day 2. Increased cyclin D1 (CCND1), CCND2 and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC) expressions were observed at day 4.

ERVs result from retroviral infections of germ-line cells, and once integrated into host DNA they become part of the host's heritable genetic material. ERVs have been ascribed positive effects on host physiology such as the generation of novel, adaptive genetic variation and resistance to infection, as well as negative effects as agents of tumorigenesis and disease. The avian leukosis virus subgroup E family (ALVE) of endogenous viruses of chickens has been used as a model system for studying the effects of ERVs on host physiology, and approximately 30 distinct ALVE proviruses have been described in the Gallus gallus genome. In this report we describe the development of a software tool, which we call Vermillion, and the use of this tool in combination with targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) to increase the number of known proviruses belonging to the ALVE family of ERVs in the chicken genome by 4-fold, including expanding the number of known ALVE elements on chromosome 1 (Gga1) from the current 9 to a total of 40. Although we focused on the discovery of ALVE elements in chickens, with appropriate selection of target sequences Vermillion can be used to develop profiles of other families of ERVs and TEs in chickens as well as in species other than the chicken.",['(c) 2016 Poultry Science Association Inc.'],"['Rutherford, K', 'Meehan, C J', 'Langille, M G I', 'Tyack, S G', 'McKay, J C', 'McLean, N L', 'Benkel, K', 'Beiko, R G', 'Benkel, B']","['Rutherford K', 'Meehan CJ', 'Langille MG', 'Tyack SG', 'McKay JC', 'McLean NL', 'Benkel K', 'Beiko RG', 'Benkel B']",,"['Dalhousie University, Faculty of Computer Science, 6050 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Computer Science, 6050 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2 Institute of Tropical Medicine, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Antwerp 2000, Belgium.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Computer Science, 6050 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2 Dalhousie University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology, 5850 College St, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2.', 'EW GROUP, 1 Hogenboegen, Visbek, Germany.', 'EW GROUP, 1 Hogenboegen, Visbek, Germany.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant and Animal Sciences, Box 550, Truro, NS, B2N 5E3.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant and Animal Sciences, Box 550, Truro, NS, B2N 5E3.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Computer Science, 6050 University Avenue, Halifax, NS, Canada, B3H 4R2 rbeiko@dal.ca.', 'Dalhousie University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Plant and Animal Sciences, Box 550, Truro, NS, B2N 5E3.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160627,England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Chickens', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*veterinary', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics/physiology', '*Software']",,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/04/12 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/12 06:00 [medline]']","['S0032-5791(19)31750-X [pii]', '10.3382/ps/pew194 [doi]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2016 Oct 1;95(10):2250-8. doi: 10.3382/ps/pew194.

Consequently, serious adverse events, such as prolonged periods of profound myelosuppression, contribute to AML treatment-related mortality. Telomeres, the repetitive DNA-protein structures at chromosome ends, influence cellular replicative capacity in that critically short telomeres can induce cell senescence or apoptosis. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of telomere length on duration of post-therapy neutropenia in a pediatric AML cohort. Patients and Methods Patients were diagnosed with de novo AML, enrolled in Children's Oncology Group study AAML0531, and included those with (n = 53) and without (n = 62) significantly delayed neutrophil recovery after chemotherapy. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure telomere content (TC), a validated proxy for telomere length, from remission bone marrow samples obtained after the second induction chemotherapy course. Results Less TC was significantly associated with prolonged neutropenia after the fourth ( P < .001) and fifth chemotherapy courses ( P = .002). Cox regression adjusting for age at diagnosis confirmed that TC remained independently predictive of time to recovery of absolute neutrophil count for both the fourth and fifth courses ( P = .002 and .009, respectively). DNA from patients was analyzed for germline mutations in four telomere maintenance genes associated with telomere biology disorders. Sequence analysis revealed no enrichment of rare or novel variants in the delayed recovery group. Conclusion Our results suggest that TC at end of AML induction is associated with hematopoietic reconstitution capacity independently of age and may identify those at highest risk for markedly delayed bone marrow recovery after AML therapy.",,"['Gerbing, Robert B', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Sung, Lillian', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Plon, Sharon E', 'Bertuch, Alison A', 'Gramatges, Maria M']","['Gerbing RB', 'Alonzo TA', 'Sung L', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Plon SE', 'Bertuch AA', 'Gramatges MM']",,"[""Robert B.

Tumor reactivity can be encoded genetically by introducing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) into T cells. CARs are composed of an antigen-binding domain and an intracellular T cell activation domain. Early human trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) showed limited responses until CARs included a costimulation domain, and conditioning chemotherapy was given before T cell infusion. Clinical trials evaluating CD19-targeted CAR T cells for B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are demonstrating response rates up to 90%. However, these clinical outcomes are associated with a cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which is caused by T cell activation and manifests as high-grade fever, hypotension, and other cardiovascular complications. It is currently managed conservatively but can be treated with cytokine-directed therapy or with high-dose steroids. Current efforts are dedicated to confirming the clinical efficacy and managing toxicities in multicenter Phase II trials.

Patients with these conditions were mainly thought to harbour JAK2V617F mutations or an Myeloproliferative leukaemia (MPL) substitution. In 2013, two revolutionary studies identified recurrent mutations in a gene that encodes the protein calreticulin (CALR). This mutation was detected in patients with PMF and ET with non-mutated JAK2 or MPL but was absent in patients with PV. The CALR gene encodes the calreticulin protein, which is a multifactorial protein, mainly located in the endoplasmic reticulum in chromosome 19 and regulates calcium homeostasis, chaperones and has also been implicated in multiple cellular processes including cell signalling, regulation of gene expression, cell adhesion, autoimmunity and apoptosis. Somatic 52 bp deletions and recurrent 52 bp insertion mutations in CALR were detected and all resulted in frameshift and clusters in exon 9 of the gene. This review will summarise the current knowledge on the CALR gene and mutation of the gene in pathological conditions and patient phenotypes.","['Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Here, we show that PBX1 controls a novel transcriptional network required for mDAn specification and survival, which is sufficient to generate mDAn from human stem cells. Mechanistically, PBX1 plays a dual role in transcription by directly repressing or activating genes, such as Onecut2 to inhibit lateral fates during embryogenesis, Pitx3 to promote mDAn development, and Nfe2l1 to protect from oxidative stress. Notably, PBX1 and NFE2L1 levels are severely reduced in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and decreased NFE2L1 levels increases damage by oxidative stress in human midbrain cells.

However, given the advantage in mounting quicker and more robust responses to recurrent infection, it is unsurprising that alternative strategies of memory are found in various immune cells throughout the evolutionary tree. In this context, a variety of NK cell memory subsets have recently been identified. Mouse models of cytomegalovirus infection have been instrumental in revealing the kinetics and molecular mechanisms of long-lived NK cell memory. Moreover, murine liver-resident memory NK cell subsets have been identified that potentially harbour antigen-specificity. Phenotypic counter-parts have recently been characterised in the human liver, adding to the mounting evidence suggesting that a spectrum of NK cell memory subsets exist in primates. These include cytomegalovirus-associated peripheral blood NK cell expansions that in humans have been shown to harbour epigenetic alterations that impact cellular phenotype and function.

Whole genome analyses were performed to test the hypothesis that temporal cortical gene expression differs between TLE patients with high vs. low baseline seizure frequency. METHODS: Baseline seizure frequency was used as a clinical measure of epileptogenicity. Twenty-four patients in high or low seizure frequency groups (median seizures/month) underwent anterior temporal lobectomy with amygdalohippocampectomy for intractable TLE. RNA was isolated from the lateral temporal cortex and submitted for expression analysis. Genes significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency on likelihood ratio test were identified based on >0.90 area under the ROC curve, P value of <0.05. RESULTS: Expression levels of forty genes were significantly associated with baseline seizure frequency. Of the seven most significant, four have been linked to other neurologic diseases. Expression levels associated with high seizure frequency included low expression of Homeobox A10, Forkhead box A2, Lymphoblastic leukemia derived sequence 1, HGF activator, Kelch repeat and BTB (POZ) domain containing 11, Thanatos-associated protein domain containing 8 and Heparin sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 3A1. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes novel associations between forty known genes and a clinical marker of epileptogenicity, baseline seizure frequency. Four of the seven discussed have been previously related to other neurologic diseases. Future investigation of these genes could establish new biomarkers for predicting epileptogenicity, and could have significant implications for diagnosis and management of temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as epilepsy pathogenesis.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Therefore, l-asparaginases with reduced l-glutaminase activity are predicted to be safer. We exploited our recently described structures of the Erwinia chrysanthemi l-asparaginase (ErA) to inform the design of mutants with diminished ability to hydrolyze l-glutamine. Structural analysis of these variants provides insight into the molecular basis for the increased l-asparagine specificity. A primary role is attributed to the E63Q mutation that acts to hinder the correct positioning of l-glutamine but not l-asparagine. The substitution of Ser-254 with either an asparagine or a glutamine increases the l-asparagine specificity but only when combined with the E63Q mutation. The A31I mutation reduces the substrate Km value; this is a key property to allow the required therapeutic l-asparagine depletion. Significantly, an ultra-low l-glutaminase ErA variant maintained its cell killing ability. By diminishing the l-glutaminase activity of these highly active l-asparaginases, our engineered ErA variants hold promise as l-asparaginases with fewer side effects.","['(c) 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.']","['Nguyen, Hien Anh', 'Su, Ying', 'Lavie, Arnon']","['Nguyen HA', 'Su Y', 'Lavie A']",,"['From the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612 and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607.', 'From the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612 and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607.', 'From the Jesse Brown Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois 60612 and the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607 Lavie@uic.edu.']",['eng'],"['I01 BX001919/BX/BLRD VA/United States', 'R01 EB013685/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States']",['Journal Article'],20160627,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dickeya chrysanthemi/*enzymology/genetics', '*Glutaminase', 'Humans', '*Mutation, Missense']",PMC5016162,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/05/13 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33407-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M116.728485 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2016 Aug 19;291(34):17664-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M116.728485.

We demonstrate in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) that, irrespective of the complex oncogenic abnormalities underlying tumor progression, experimentally induced, persistent T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling has antileukemic properties and enforces a molecular program resembling thymic negative selection, a major developmental event in normal T-cell development. Using mouse models of T-ALL, we show that induction of TCR signaling by high-affinity self-peptide/MHC or treatment with monoclonal antibodies to the CD3epsilon chain (anti-CD3) causes massive leukemic cell death. Importantly, anti-CD3 treatment hampered leukemogenesis in mice transplanted with either mouse- or patient-derived T-ALLs. These data provide a strong rationale for targeted therapy based on anti-CD3 treatment of patients with TCR-expressing T-ALL and demonstrate that endogenous developmental checkpoint pathways are amenable to therapeutic intervention in cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE: T-ALLs are aggressive malignant lymphoid proliferations of T-cell precursors characterized by high relapse rates and poor prognosis, calling for the search for novel therapeutic options. Here, we report that the lineage-specific TCR/CD3 developmental checkpoint controlling cell death in normal T-cell progenitors remains switchable to induce massive tumor cell apoptosis in T-ALL and is amenable to preclinical therapeutic intervention.

The locus comprises an active enhancer region, in which some of the associated SNPs alter transcription factor binding. We now identify miR-3662 as a new functional driver contributing to the associated phenotypes. The GWAS SNPs are strongly associated with higher miR-3662 expression. Genome editing of rs66650371, a three-base-pair deletion, suggests a functional link between the SNP genotype and the abundance of miR-3662. Increasing miR-3662's abundance increases colony formation in hematopoietic progenitor cells, particularly the erythroid lineage. In contrast, miR-3662 is not expressed in acute myeloid leukemia cells, and its overexpression has potent antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo Mechanistically, miR-3662 directly targets NF-kappaB-mediated transcription. Thus, miR-3662 is a new player of the hematopoietic 6q23.3 locus. SIGNIFICANCE: The characterization of miR-3662 has identified a new actor in the prominent hematopoietic quantitative trait locus in chromosome 6q23.3. The mechanistic insights into miR-3662's function may reveal novel or only partially known pathways for normal and malignant hematopoietic cell proliferation. Cancer Discov; 6(9); 1036-51.

In this study, we evaluated the clinical features and relative frequencies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes in five developing regions of the world and compared the findings to the developed world. Five expert hematopathologists classified 4848 consecutive cases of lymphoma from 26 centers in 24 countries using the World Health Organization classification, and 4539 (93.6%) were confirmed to be non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with a significantly greater number of males than females in the developing regions compared to the developed world (P<0.05). The median age at diagnosis was significantly lower for both low- and high-grade B-cell lymphoma in the developing regions. The developing regions had a significantly lower frequency of B-cell lymphoma (86.6%) and a higher frequency of T- and natural killer-cell lymphoma (13.4%) compared to the developed world (90.7% and 9.3%, respectively). Also, the developing regions had significantly more cases of high-grade B-cell lymphoma (59.6%) and fewer cases of low-grade B-cell lymphoma (22.7%) compared to the developed world (39.2% and 32.7%, respectively). Among the B-cell lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was the most common subtype (42.5%) in the developing regions. Burkitt lymphoma (2.2%), precursor B- and T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (1.1% and 2.9%, respectively) and extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (2.2%) were also significantly increased in the developing regions.

In addition to effector cells, infusions contain CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Treg) that may suppress graft-versus-tumor responses. We undertook a phase I study of donor lymphocyte infusions depleted of CD25(+) T cells in patients with hematologic malignancies who had relapsed after transplantation. Twenty-one subjects received CD25/Treg-depleted infusions following removal of CD25(+) cells using antibody-conjugated magnetic beads. Sixteen subjects received prior cytoreductive therapy. Four were in complete remission at the time of infusion. Two dose levels were administered: 1x10(7) (n=6) and 3x10(7) CD3(+) cells/kg (n=15). A median 2.3 log-depletion of CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) Treg was achieved. Seven subjects (33%) developed clinically significant graft-versus-host disease by 1 year, including one patient who died. At dose level 1, five subjects had progressive disease and one had stable disease. At dose level 2, nine subjects (60%) achieved or maintained responses (8 complete responses, 1 partial response), including seven with active disease at the time of infusion. A shorter period between relapse and infusion was associated with response at dose level 2 (P=0.016). The 1-year survival rate was 53% among patients treated with dose level 2. Four of eight subjects with acute myeloid leukemia remained in remission at 1 year. When compared to unmodified donor lymphocyte infusions in 14 contemporaneous patients meeting study eligibility, CD25/Treg depletion was associated with a better response rate and improved event-free survival. Circulating naive and central memory CD4(+) T cells increased after CD25/Treg-depleted infusion, but no immunophenotypic signature for response was noted. CD25/Treg-depleted donor infusion appears feasible and capable of inducing graft-versus-tumor responses without excessive graft-versus-host disease.

We performed targeted next-generation sequencing on CMML and AITL DNA, which revealed mutations of TET2, DNMT3A, SRSF2, NRAS and IDH1, thus confirming that the spectrum of AITL mutations share similarities with myeloid disorders. The frequencies of TET2/DNMT3A and SRSF2 variants could support the hypothesis that TET2/DNMT3A mutations occurred in an early progenitor cell, which later progressed to both the AITL and CMML clones. Treatment with 5-azacytidine led to the complete remission of both diseases. Thus, targeting DNA methylation abnormalities in AITL may be an alternative strategy to chemotherapy.

TAM connotes a spontaneously resolving congenital myeloproliferative state observed in 10%-20% of DS newborns. Following varying intervals of apparent remission, a proportion of children with TAM progress to develop ML-DS in early childhood. Therefore, TAM and ML-DS represent a biological continuum. Both disorders are characterised by recurring truncating somatic mutations of the GATA1 gene, which are considered key pathogenetic events. METHODS: We herein report, to our knowledge, the first observation on the frequency and nature of GATA1 gene mutations in a cohort of Malaysian children with DS-associated TAM (n = 9) and ML-DS (n = 24) encountered successively over a period of five years at a national referral centre. RESULTS: Of the 29 patients who underwent GATA1 analysis, GATA1 mutations were observed in 15 (51.7%) patients, including 6 (75.0%) out of 8 patients with TAM, and 9 (42.9%) of 21 patients with ML-DS. All identified mutations were located in exon 2 and the majority were sequence-terminating insertions or deletions (66.7%), including several hitherto unreported mutations (12 out of 15). CONCLUSION: The low frequency of GATA1 mutations in ML-DS patients is unusual and potentially indicates distinctive genomic events in our patient cohort.",['Copyright: (c) Singapore Medical Association.'],"['Lum, Su Han', 'Choong, Soo Sin', 'Krishnan, Shekhar', 'Mohamed, Zulqarnain', 'Ariffin, Hany']","['Lum SH', 'Choong SS', 'Krishnan S', 'Mohamed Z', 'Ariffin H']",,"['Department of Paediatrics, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Unit of Genetics and Molecular Biology, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'University Malaya Cancer Research Institute, Faculty of Medicine, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Singapore,Singapore Med J,Singapore medical journal,0404516,"['0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",IM,"['Cohort Studies', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Exons', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*genetics', 'Leukemoid Reaction/complications/*genetics', 'Malaysia', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Remission Induction']",PMC4971451,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/04/07 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['j57/6/320 [pii]', '10.11622/smedj.2016106 [doi]']",ppublish,Singapore Med J. 2016 Jun;57(6):320-4. doi: 10.11622/smedj.2016106.,['NOTNLM'],"['Down syndrome', 'GATA1', 'ML-DS', 'TAM']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we deliver the rationale and molecular basis for the combination of idasanutlin and venetoclax for treatment of p53 wild-type AML. METHODS: The effect of idasanutlin and venetoclax combination on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression was investigated in vitro using established AML cell lines. In vivo efficacy was demonstrated in subcutaneous and orthotopic xenograft models generated in female nude or non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice. Mode-of-action analyses were performed by means of cell cycle kinetic studies, RNA sequencing as well as western blotting experiments. RESULTS: Combination treatment with venetoclax and idasanutlin results in synergistic anti-tumor activity compared with the respective single-agent treatments in vitro, in p53 wild-type AML cell lines, and leads to strongly superior efficacy in vivo, in subcutaneous and orthotopic AML models. The inhibitory effects of idasanutlin were cell-cycle dependent, with cells arresting in G1 in consecutive cycles and the induction of apoptosis only evident after cells had gone through at least two cell cycles. Combination treatment with venetoclax removed this dependency, resulting in an acceleration of cell death kinetics. As expected, gene expression studies using RNA sequencing showed significant alterations to pathways associated with p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest (CCND1 pathway) in response to idasanutlin treatment. Only few gene expression changes were observed for venetoclax treatment and combination treatment, indicating that their effects are mediated mainly at the post-transcriptional level. Protein expression studies demonstrated that inhibition of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 contributed to the activity of venetoclax and idasanutlin, with earlier inhibition of Mcl-1 in response to combination treatment contributing to the superior combined activity. The role of Mcl-1 was confirmed by small hairpin RNA gene knockdown studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide functional and molecular insight on the superior anti-tumor activity of combined idasanutlin and venetoclax treatment in AML and support its further exploration in clinical studies.",,"['Lehmann, Christian', 'Friess, Thomas', 'Birzele, Fabian', 'Kiialainen, Anna', 'Dangl, Markus']","['Lehmann C', 'Friess T', 'Birzele F', 'Kiialainen A', 'Dangl M']",,"['Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Munich, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Nonnenwald 2, 82377, Penzberg, Germany. christian.lehmann.cl1@roche.com.', 'Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Munich, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Nonnenwald 2, 82377, Penzberg, Germany.', 'Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel, F-Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Basel, F-Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Roche Pharma Research & Early Development, Roche Innovation Center Munich, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Nonnenwald 2, 82377, Penzberg, Germany.', 'Present address: Medigene Immunotherapies GmbH, Planegg, Martinsried, Germany.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20160628,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (RG7388)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (para-Aminobenzoates)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Sulfonamides/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'para-Aminobenzoates/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC4924270,2016/06/30 06:00,2017/12/06 06:00,['2016/06/30 06:00'],"['2016/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-016-0280-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-016-0280-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2016 Jun 28;9(1):50. doi: 10.1186/s13045-016-0280-3.,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Apoptosis', '*BCL-2', '*Cell cycle kinetics', '*Idasanutlin', '*MCL-1', '*MDM2', '*Synergism', '*Venetoclax', '*p53']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approved drugs - imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib - target the ATP-binding site of Abl kinase. Even though these drugs are initially effective, long-term usefulness is limited by the development of resistance. To overcome this problem, targeting the allosteric site of Abl kinase, which is remote from the ATP-binding site is found to be a useful strategy. In this study, structure-based and ligand-based virtual screening methods were applied to narrow down possible drugs (from DrugBank database) that could target the allosteric site of Abl kinase. Detailed investigations of the selected drugs in the allosteric site of Abl kinase, using molecular dynamics and steered molecular dynamics simulation shows that gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor approved for the treatment of lung cancer, could bind effectively to the allosteric site of Bcr-Abl. More interestingly, gefitinib was found to enhance the ability of imatinib to bind at the ATP-binding site of Bcr-Abl kinase. Based on the in silico findings, gefitinib was tested in combination with imatinib in K562 CML cell line using MTT cell proliferation assay and found to have a synergistic antiproliferative activity.

Literature search methodology included examination of PubMed index, meeting presentations, and updated Investigator's brochures and data files of TKIs companies. Expert commentary: Male patients trying to conceive apparently have no limitation in the use of TKIs, while effective contraception should be encouraged in all female patients due to the risk of fetal complications after drug exposure.

Recently, we reported that Asxl1(+/-) mice develop myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or MDS and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) overlapping diseases (MDS/MPN). Although defective erythroid maturation and anemia are associated with the prognosis of patients with MDS or MDS/MPN, the role of ASXL1 in erythropoiesis remains unclear. Here, we showed that chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patients with ASXL1 mutations exhibited more severe anemia with a significantly increased proportion of bone marrow (BM) early stage erythroblasts and reduced enucleated erythrocytes compared to CMML patients with WT ASXL1. Knockdown of ASXL1 in cord blood CD34(+) cells reduced erythropoiesis and impaired erythrocyte enucleation. Consistently, the BM and spleens of VavCre(+);Asxl1(f/f) (Asxl1(/)) mice had less numbers of erythroid progenitors than Asxl1(f/f) controls.

Commonly reported paraneoplastic dermatologic manifestations include acanthosis nigricans, dermatomyositis, erythroderma, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy, Sweet syndrome, and paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). PNP is a rare autoimmune mucocutaneous disease characterized by severe stomatitis, polymorphic skin eruptions, and associated underlying neoplasms most commonly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Castleman disease. PNP is characterized on histopathology as dyskeratotic epithelial cells with acantholysis with a typical immunofluorescence staining pattern of direct and/or indirect staining of intercellular, basement membrane, and dermoepidermal junction with immunoglobulin-G and C3. PNP has been described to have poor prognosis with a mortality range of 75-90% and a mean survival of less than 1year. We describe a previously unreported case of PNP associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where the patient presented with a nonhealing ulcer and hemorrhagic crusting on the face that did not respond to antimicrobials and steroids. Investigations revealed leukocytosis with peripherally circulating blasts. Skin biopsy revealed an evolving PNP and bone marrow biopsy confirmed evidence of AML. The patient underwent induction, consolidation, and then successful allogenic bone marrow transplantation with complete remission. The skin lesion, which was initially refractory to treatments, surprisingly resolved within 7days of starting induction chemotherapy. In this case, the skin lesion was a key factor in early diagnosis and instituting treatment for the underlying AML. Early intervention gave our patient a better outcome with an ongoing survival of 18months since diagnosis, maintaining complete remission.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre.

One of its etiologies has been attributed to a paraneoplastic, immune complex phenomenon occurring in CLL. Although there is no standard of care in such patients, use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies like rituximab have been used before in such patients with variable responses. Obinutuzumab is a novel, type II, immunoglobulin-G1 monoclonal antibody with a higher efficacy than rituximab and has an established safely profile in patients with comorbidities and poor renal functions. There are no such reported cases of MPGN in CLL being treated with obinutuzumab. METHODS: We used the standard doses of obinutuzumab in our elderly patient (78-year-old woman) with high-risk CLL due to an underlying TP53 mutation, along with a MPGN-related acute renal failure. RESULTS: The patient achieved complete remission after six cycles of obinutuzumab; however, she remained positive for minimal residual disease on flow cytometry. Her renal function improved completely, suggesting a complete response of her underlying MPGN. CONCLUSION: Obinutuzumab has an established safety profile in patients with CLL, but our case is the first reported case of a paraneoplastic, immune complex-mediated MPGN in CLL being treated with obinutuzumab. Obinutuzumab should be explored as a potential option in patients with CLL and MPGN.","['Copyright (c) 2016 King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre. Published', 'by Elsevier B.V.

However, up to 20% of patients are unable to receive vincristine-prednisone-L-asparaginase-doxorubicin secondary to asparaginase intolerance. We report our experience with a promising reinduction regimen for children with relapsed ALL who are unable to receive asparaginase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a single institution, retrospective review of the safety and activity of bortezomib, dexamethasone, mitoxantrone, and vinorelbine (BDMV) in patients with relapsed ALL. Complete remission and adverse events after reinduction were study endpoints. Patients treated with BDMV between 2012 and 2015 were identified. Response and adverse events (AEs) were assessed by review of medical records. Standard response criteria were used and AEs were graded based on NCI CTCAEv4.0. RESULTS: Seven of 10 patients achieved complete remission after 1 cycle of BDMV, with 4 achieving minimal residual disease negativity. The most common >/=grade 3 nonhematological toxicities were infection (91%), gastrointestinal (45%), metabolic (45%), and cardiovascular (9%).

Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples from the patients after the first visit and the patients who were improved or alleviated, were subjected to high-throughput sequencing to compare the gene expression. The single nucleotide mutation related to subtype M2 AML was detected. Meanwhile, real-time fluorescent quantitation RT-PCR was used to detect the AML1/ETO fusion gene and its correlation with prognosis after treatment. Among 96 patients, AML1-ETO fusion gene was positive in 52 cases, the positive rate was 54.17 %. The complete relief (CR) rate of AML1-ETO fusion gene positive patients was 84.62 %, and the CR rate of AML1/ETO fusion gene negative patients was 77.27 %; the CR rate of AML1-ETO positive patients was higher than that of patients without the fusion gene, however there was no statistical difference.

Such direct methods can only provide prevalence for the years over which the registry has been operational. Time-defined estimates, including 5- and 10-year prevalence, may however underestimate the total cancer burden, and compared with other cancers, there is a lack of accurate information on the total prevalence of hematological malignancy subtypes. Accordingly, we aimed to estimate prevalence (observed and total prevalence) of hematological malignancies and precursor conditions by clinically meaningful subtypes using data from the UK's specialist population-based register, the Haematological Malignancy Research Network ( www.hmrn.org ). METHODS: Observed and total prevalences were estimated from 15,810 new diagnoses of hematological malignancies from 2004 to 2011 and followed up to the 31 August 2011 (index data). Observed prevalence was calculated by the counting method, and a method based on modelling incidence and survival was used to estimate total prevalence. Estimates were made according to current disease classification for the HMRN region and for the UK. RESULTS: The overall observed and total prevalence rates were 281.9 and 548.8 per 100,000, respectively; the total number of observed and total prevalent cases in the UK was estimated as 165,841 and 327,818 cases, as expected variation existed by disease subtype reflecting the heterogeneity in underlying disease incidence, survival and age distribution of hematological cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the importance of estimating 'total' prevalence rather than 'observed' prevalence by current disease classification (ICD-O-3), particularly for subtypes that have a more indolent nature and for those that are curable. Importantly, these analyses demonstrate that relying on observed prevalence alone would result in a significant underestimation of the relative burden of some subtypes. While many of these cases may be considered cured and no longer being actively treated, people in this survivorship phase may have long-term medical needs and accordingly, it is important to provide accurate counts to allow for healthcare planning.",,"['Li, Jinlei', 'Smith, Alex', 'Crouch, Simon', 'Oliver, Steven', 'Roman, Eve']","['Li J', 'Smith A', 'Crouch S', 'Oliver S', 'Roman E']",,"['Department of Health Sciences, University of York, Seebohm Rowntree Building, Heslington, York, YO10 5DD, UK.', 'Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Health Sciences, University of York, Seebohm Rowntree Building, Heslington, York, YO10 5DD, UK.

The genetic abnormalities underlying AML are extremely heterogeneous among patients, making prognosis and treatment selection very difficult.

Here we report the results and insights gained from the DREAM 9 Acute Myeloid Prediction Outcome Prediction Challenge (AML-OPC), a crowdsourcing effort designed to promote the development of quantitative methods for AML prognosis prediction. We identify the most accurate and robust models in predicting patient response to therapy, remission duration, and overall survival. We further investigate patient response to therapy, a clinically actionable prediction, and find that patients that are classified as resistant to therapy are harder to predict than responsive patients across the 31 models submitted to the challenge. The top two performing models, which held a high sensitivity to these patients, substantially utilized the proteomics data to make predictions.

Biological tests usually considered as characteristic for secondary hemolytic anemia (reticulocytosis, unconjugated bilirubin, urinary excretion of urobilinogen, serum iron, granulopoiesis/erythropoiesis ratio) have not an unequivocal significance : they may be normal in cases with true hemolytic anemia or abnormal in patients with a normal survival time of the red cells.

The objective of the current study was to determine whether the local health care infrastructure, represented by Area Health Education Centers (AHEC) region, or treating center experience, represented by National Cancer Institute Comprehensive Cancer Center (NCICCC) designation, were associated with outcomes among patients with AML in North Carolina. METHODS: Patients who were diagnosed with AML from 2003 to 2009 were identified using the University of North Carolina Lineberger Integrated Cancer Information and Surveillance System, a database linking insurance claims to the North Carolina Cancer Registry. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to explore survival based on AHEC region. A subset of patients who received inpatient chemotherapy was examined to evaluate the impact of treatment at an NCICCC. RESULTS: Nine hundred patients were identified in the study period, 553 of whom received inpatient chemotherapy therapy within 30 days of diagnosis. Almost one-half of these patients (n = 294) received chemotherapy at a non-NCICCC. Among the patients who received intensive inpatient therapy, residence in 3 of 9 AHEC regions was associated with a higher risk of mortality (hazard ratio: range, 1.97-4.03; P < .01) at 1 year in multivariate analysis. Treatment at a non-NCICCC was not associated with an increased risk of mortality at 1 year (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.65).

We compared clinical outcomes and disease complications in 63 patients with HCL aged </=40 years at diagnosis with 268 patients >40 years treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. The rate of complete remission following initial therapy was 87% and 83% (P = 0.71) and estimated 10-year overall survival was 100% and 82% (P = 0.25) in younger and older patients, respectively. Younger patients required therapy earlier and had a significantly shorter time between first and second therapy (median: 63 months vs. 145 months) (P = 0.008). Younger patients required significantly more lines of therapy during follow-up. The 10-year cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies in young and old patients was 0.205 and 0.287, respectively (P = 0.22). The incidence of secondary cancers in patients aged >40 years at diagnosis increased with the number of treatments for HCL (P = 0.018). These results highlight that young patients with HCL have shorter responses to treatment and require more lines of therapy to maintain disease control, while attaining similar long-term survival.

It occurs in around 5% of patients with CLL. AREA COVERED: This review will focus on the biology and treatment of RT. We also address the management of RT in the era of targeted therapies. Based on clonal relationship of large cell component to CLL, 2 distinct subtypes could be identified: clonally-related RT which carries a worse outcome, and clonally-unrelated RT where the outcomes are similar to de novo DLBCL. Aberrations of TP53, CDKN2A, MYC, and NOTCH1 are common in RT, many of which are acquired at the time of transformation. PET scan remains the imaging modality of choice for patients with suspected RT. It is important to perform a biopsy rather than fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the suspicious lesions, as FNA can lead to false negative results. Chemoimmunotherapy remains the treatment of choice, though the outcomes remain suboptimal. The median survival is less than 1 year. Novel therapies are needed for patients with RT.

Universal varicella vaccine programs have significantly decreased this risk in many highincome countries, but in most low-income and middleincome countries, the burden of varicella in children treated for malignancy is poorly defined. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed records of children at the National Unit of Pediatric Oncology (UNOP) in Guatemala diagnosed with varicella between January 2009 and March 2013 in order to calculate incidence of varicella and evaluate morbidity, mortality, treatment interruption, and cost. RESULTS: Fifty-nine cases of varicella were identified. Incidence was 23.4 cases per 1000 person-years (p-y). 66.1% of cases occurred in children with leukemia (median age 5.2 years; interquantile range 3.4-7 years) and 41.0% of these occurred during maintenance therapy. Source of exposure was identified for 14/59 (23.7%) children. Most were hospitalized (71.2%) and given intravenous acyclovir (64.4%). Eight (13.6%) children required critical care, and two (3.4%) died from disseminated varicella with multiorgan failure. Chemotherapy was delayed or omitted due to varicella in 50%. No significant differences in outcomes based on nutritional and immunologic status were detected. The minimum average cost of treatment per episode was 598.75 USD. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella is a significant problem in children treated for cancer in Guatemala, where effective post-exposure prophylaxis is limited. In the absence of universal varicella vaccination, strategies to improve recognition of exposure and the future use of novel inactivated vaccines currently under investigation in clinical trials could mitigate this burden.",,"['Brown, Amy E Caruso', 'Asturias, Edwin J', 'Melgar, Mario', 'Antillon-Klussmann, Federico A', 'Mettler, Pamela', 'Levin, Myron J']","['Brown AEC', 'Asturias EJ', 'Melgar M', 'Antillon-Klussmann FA', 'Mettler P', 'Levin MJ']",,"['Center for Bioethics and Humanities and Department of Pediatrics, SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, USA. brownamy@upstate.edu.', 'Center for Global Health and Department of Epidemiology, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'National Unit of Pediatric Oncology, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'National Unit of Pediatric Oncology, Guatemala City, Guatemala.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Informatics, Colorado Biostatistics Consortium, Colorado School of Public Health, Aurora, Colorado, USA.', 'Section of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, Colorado, USA.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160629,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chickenpox/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Comorbidity', 'Databases, Factual', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Guatemala/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2016/06/29 06:00,2017/12/16 06:00,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2014/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12519-016-0025-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12519-016-0025-y [pii]']",ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2016 Aug;12(3):320-326. doi: 10.1007/s12519-016-0025-y.

In this study, we investigated the alteration of N- and O-linked glycans as well as glycosphingolipids, during THP-1 differentiation, combining mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, and quantitative real-time PCR. Mass spectrometry revealed that macrophage differentiation led to a marked upregulation of expression of GM3 ganglioside as well as an increase in complex-type structures, particularly triantennary glycans, occurring at the expense of high-mannose N-glycans. Moreover, we observed a slight decrease in the proportion of multifucosylated N-glycans and alpha2,6-sialylation. The uncovered changes in glycosylation correlated with variations of gene expression of relevant glycosyltransferases and glycosidases including sialyltransferases, beta-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases, fucosyltransferases, and neuraminidase. Furthermore, using flow cytometry and antibodies directed against glycan structures, we confirmed that the alteration of glycosylation occurs at the cell surface of THP-1 macrophage-like cells. Altogether, we established that macrophagic maturation of THP-1 induces dramatic modifications of the surface glycosylation pattern that may result in differential interaction of monocytic and macrophagic THP-1 with immune or bacterial lectins.",,"['Delannoy, Clement P', 'Rombouts, Yoann', 'Groux-Degroote, Sophie', 'Holst, Stephanie', 'Coddeville, Bernadette', 'Harduin-Lepers, Anne', 'Wuhrer, Manfred', 'Elass-Rochard, Elisabeth', 'Guerardel, Yann']","['Delannoy CP', 'Rombouts Y', 'Groux-Degroote S', 'Holst S', 'Coddeville B', 'Harduin-Lepers A', 'Wuhrer M', 'Elass-Rochard E', 'Guerardel Y']",,"['Univ.

California's large Hispanic population affords an important opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the leukemia burden among Hispanic children. METHODS: Leukemias diagnosed among non-Hispanic white (NHW), Hispanic, African American (AA), and Asian/Pacific Islander (API) children aged birth to 19 years between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2012 were obtained from the California Cancer Registry (11,084 cases). Age-adjusted incidence rates, standardized rate ratios (SRRs), and secular trends in incidence (annual percent change [APC]) were analyzed by subtype, race/ethnicity, sex, and age. RESULTS: Compared with NHW children, the incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was higher among Hispanic (SRR, 1.32) and lower among AA (SRR, 0.55) and API (SRR, 0.91) children. From 1990 to 2012, the incidence of ALL increased overall (APC, 1.1%) and among males (APC, 1.0%), females (APC, 1.3%), Hispanics (APC, 1.1%), AAs (APC, 1.9%), AA males (APC, 2.8%), API males (APC, 1.9%), and Hispanic females (APC, 1.5%). The incidence of ALL increased among Hispanic males aged 15 to 19 years (APC, 2.5%) and Hispanic females aged birth to 4 years and 15 to 19 years (APCs of 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively). The incidence of acute myeloid leukemia did not appear to differ among racial/ethnic groups. From 1990 to 2012, the overall incidence of acute myeloid leukemia remained stable but increased among Hispanics (APC, 1.2%), females (APC, 1.0%), Hispanic females (APC, 2.3%), and Hispanic females aged 15 to 19 years (APC, 3.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Notable differences in the incidence of childhood leukemia were observed among 4 racial/ethnic groups in California.

However, mTOR inhibitors show limited single agent efficacy in patients. mTOR inhibitors suppress tumor cell growth and angiogenesis, and have recently been shown to induce death receptor/FADD-dependent apoptosis in colon cancers. Using a panel of BRAF V600E and WT colorectal cancer cell lines and in vitro selected resistant culture, and xenograft models, we demonstrate here that BRAFV600E confers resistance to mTOR inhibitors. Everolimus treatment disrupts the S6K1-IRS-2/PI3K negative feedback loop, leading to BRAF V600E-dependent activation of ERK and Mcl-1 stabilization in colon cancer cells, which in turn blocks the crosstalk from the death receptor to mitochondria. Co-treatment with inhibitors to Mcl-1, PI3K, RAF or MEK restores mTOR inhibitor-induced apoptosis by antagonizing Mcl-1 or abrogating ERK activation in BRAFV600E cells.

In order to identify miRNAs that contribute to the clonal evolution towards relapse in pediatric AML, miRNA expression profiling of 127 de novo pediatric AML cases were used. In the diagnostic phase, no miRNA signatures could be identified that were predictive for relapse occurrence, in a large pediatric cohort, nor in a nested mixed lineage leukemia (MLL)-rearranged pediatric cohort. AML with MLL- rearrangements are found in 15-20% of all pediatric AML samples, and reveal a relapse rate up to 50% for certain translocation partner subgroups. Therefore, microRNA expression profiling of six paired initial diagnosis-relapse MLL-rearranged pediatric AML samples (test cohort) and additional eight paired initial diagnosis-relapse samples with MLL-rearrangements (validation cohort) was performed. A list of 53 differentially expressed miRNAs was identified of which the miR-106b~25 cluster, located in intron 13 of MCM7, was the most prominent. These differentially expressed miRNAs however could not predict a relapse in de novo AML samples with MLL-rearrangements at diagnosis. Furthermore, higher mRNA expression of both MCM7 and its upstream regulator E2F1 was found in relapse samples with MLL-rearrangements.

LNT was fabricated without correct data. The lifespan study of Atomic bomb survivors (LSS) has provided fundamental data to support the NLT. In LSS, exposure doses were underestimated and cancer risk was overestimated; LSS data do not support LNT anymore. In light of these findings, radiation levels and cancer risk in Fukushima are reexamined. RESULTS: Soon after the Fukushima accident, the International Commission on Radiological Protection issued an emergency recommendation that national authorities set reference highest levels in the band of 20-100 mSv and, when the radiation source is under control, reference levels are in the band of 1-20 mSv/y. The Japanese government set the limit dose as low as 1 mSv for the public and stirred up radiophobia, which continues to cause tremendous human, social, and economic losses. Estimated doses in three areas of Fukushima were 0.6-2.3 mSv/y in Tamura City, 1.1-5.5 mSv/y in Kawauchi Village, and 3.8-17 mSv/y in Iitate Village. Since even after acute irradiation, no significant differences are found below 200 mSv for leukemia and below 100 mSv for solid cancers. These data indicate that cancer risk is negligible in Fukushima. Moreover, beneficial effects (lessened cancer incidence) were observed at 400-600 mSv in LSS. Living organisms, which have established efficient defense mechanisms against radiation through 3.8 billion years of evolutionary history, can tolerate 1000 mSv/y if radiation dose rates are low. In fact, people have lived for generations without adverse health effects in high background radiation areas such as Kelara (35 mSv/y), India, and Ramsar (260 mSv/y), Iran. Low dose radiation itself is harmless, but fear of radiation is vitally harmful. CONCLUSIONS: When people return to the evacuation zones in Fukushima now and in the future, they will be exposed to such low radiation doses as to cause no physical effects. The most threatening public health issue is the adverse effect on mental health caused by undue fear of radiation.",,"['Sutou, Shizuyo']",['Sutou S'],,"['School of Pharmacy, Shujitsu University, 1-6-1 Nishigawara, Naka-ku, Okayama 703-8234 Japan.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],20160601,England,Genes Environ,Genes and environment : the official journal of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society,101285347,,,,PMC4918197,2016/06/29 06:00,2016/06/29 06:01,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2015/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2016/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41021-016-0039-7 [doi]', '39 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Environ. 2016 Jun 1;38:12. doi: 10.1186/s41021-016-0039-7. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['Atomic bomb survivors', 'Cancer risk', 'Fear to radiation', 'Hiroshima and Nagasaki', 'Hormesis', 'LNT', 'LSS', 'Lifespan study', 'Linear no-threshold']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, uncharacterized BCR-ABL1 fusion genes can be missed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)-based routine screening methods, causing adverse effect on drug selection and treatment outcome. CASE PRESENTATION: In this study, we demonstrated that the next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be employed to overcome this obstacle. Through NGS, we identified a novel BCR-ABL1 fusion gene with breakpoints in the BCR intron 14 and the ABL1 intron 2, respectively, in a rare case of CML. Its mRNA with an e14a3 junction was then detected using customized RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Subsequently, the patient received targeted medicine imatinib initially at 400 mg/day, and later 300 mg/day due to intolerance reactions. With this personalized treatment, the patient's condition was significantly improved. Interestingly, this novel fusion gene encodes a fusion protein containing a compromised SH3 domain, which is usually intact in the majority of CML cases, suggesting that dysfunctional SH3 domain may be associated with altered drug response and unique clinicopathological manifestations observed in this patient. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel BCR-ABL1 fusion gene using NGS in a rare case of CML while routine laboratory procedures were challenged, demonstrating the power of NGS as a diagnostic tool for detecting novel genetic mutations. Moreover, our new finding regarding the novel fusion variant will provide useful insights to improve the spectrum of the genomic abnormalities recognizable by routine molecular screening.",,"['Lyu, Xiaodong', 'Yang, Jingke', 'Wang, Xianwei', 'Hu, Jieying', 'Liu, Bing', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Guo, Zhen', 'Liu, Bingshan', 'Fan, Ruihua', 'Song, Yongping']","['Lyu X', 'Yang J', 'Wang X', 'Hu J', 'Liu B', 'Zhao Y', 'Guo Z', 'Liu B', 'Fan R', 'Song Y']",,"['School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'School of Basic Medical Sciences, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Central Laboratory, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University; Henan Cancer Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450000 China.']",['eng'],,['Case Reports'],20160627,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,PMC4922057,2016/06/29 06:00,2016/06/29 06:01,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2016/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/29 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-016-0257-5 [doi]', '257 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2016 Jun 27;9:47. doi: 10.1186/s13039-016-0257-5. eCollection 2016.,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL1', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Imatinib', 'Next-generation sequencing', 'SH3 domain', 'Tyrosine kinase']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three hundred and forty-five patients with de novo AML were retrospectively analyzed with regard to CEBPA mutations, clinical characteristics, therapeutic responses, and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: CEBPA mutations were detected in 59 patients (17.10%), with 47 cases harboring double mutations and 12 cases harboring single mutations. In those with a normal karyotype (NK), 44 cases (25.29%) were detected with CEBPA mutations. The following characteristics were observed in CEBPA-mutated patients: most (66.10%) of them were M1 or M2; they presented with higher peripheral white blood cell counts (23.71 [12.6, 60.02] x10(9)/L versus 7.34 [2.38, 26.63] x10(9)/L; u=4.944, P<0.001) and higher hemoglobin levels (89.64+/-23.05 g/L versus 75.65+/-23.65 g/L; t=4.156, P<0.001) than those observed in patients without the mutation; and the expression of CD7 and HLA-DR was higher, whereas that of CD34 and CD56 was lower in patients with the mutation than in those without the mutation. Compared with those without the mutation, patients with CEBPA mutations had a superior complete remission rate (75.0% versus 56.54%; chi (2)=6.185, P=0.013) and superior overall survival (P=0.034).

METHOD: The present study seeks to compare conventional Sanger sequencing with deep sequencing using MiSeq platform to study quasispecies dynamics of ALV-J. RESULTS: The accuracy and reproducibility of MiSeq sequencing was determined better than Sanger sequencing by running each experiment in duplicate. According to the mutational rate of single position and the ability to distinguish dominant quasispecies with two sequencing methods, conventional Sanger sequencing technique displayed high randomness due to few sequencing samples, while deep sequencing could reflect the composition of the quasispecies more accurately. In the mean time, the research of quasispecies via Sanger sequencing was simulated and analyzed with the aid of re-sampling strategy with replacement for 1000 times repeat from high-throughput sequencing data, which indicated that the higher antibody titer, the higher sequence entropy, the harder analyzing with the conventional Sanger sequencing, resulted in lower ratios of dominant variants. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, deep sequencing is better suited for detecting rare variants comprehensively. The simulation of Sanger sequencing that we propose here will also help to standardize quasispecies researching under different selection pressure based on next-generation sequencing data.",,"['Meng, Fanfeng', 'Dong, Xuan', 'Hu, Tao', 'Liu, Yingnan', 'Zhao, Yingjie', 'Lv, Yanyan', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Zhao, Peng', 'Cui, Zhizhong']","['Meng F', 'Dong X', 'Hu T', 'Liu Y', 'Zhao Y', 'Lv Y', 'Chang S', 'Zhao P', 'Cui Z']",,"['College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'Institute of Pathogen Biology, Taishan Medical College, Taian, 271000, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China. zhaopeng@sdau.edu.cn.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Taian, 271018, China. zzcui@sdau.edu.cn.']",['eng'],,"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",20160627,England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'Genetic Variation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/instrumentation/*methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology']",PMC4924251,2016/06/29 06:00,2017/08/02 06:00,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2016/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/08/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-016-0559-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-016-0559-6 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2016 Jun 27;13:112. doi: 10.1186/s12985-016-0559-6.,['NOTNLM'],['*Quasispecies-Sanger sequencing-deep sequencing-simulation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notably, these cells possess the unique ability to induce primary immune responses. In the present study, a method of cultivating and purifying DCs from chicken bone marrow in vitro was established to investigate the effects of ALV-J infection on BM-DC differentiation or generation. The results indicated that ALV-J not only infects the chicken bone marrow mononuclear cells but also appears to inhibit the differentiation and maturation of BM-DCs and to trigger apoptosis. Moreover, substantial reductions in the mRNA expression of TLR1, TLR2, TLR3, MHCI, and MHCII and in cytokine production were detected in the surviving BM-DCs following ALV-J infection.

The lymphocytosis is predominantly observed in cytomegalovirus (CMV)-seropositive patients, yet detectable CMV reactivation exists only in a small fraction of patients. Thus, etiology of the lymphocytosis still remains unclear. Here, we identified NK cells as the dominant LGLs expanding in dasatinib-treated patients, and applied principal component analysis (PCA) to an extensive panel of NK cell markers to explore underlying factors in NK cell activation. PCA displayed phenotypic divergence of NK cells that reflects CMV-associated differentiation and genetic differences, and the divergence was markedly augmented in CMV-seropositive dasatinib-treated patients. Notably, the CMV-associated highly differentiated status of NK cells was already observed at leukemia diagnosis, and was further enhanced after starting dasatinib in virtually all CMV-seropositive patients. Thus, the extensive characterization of NK cells by PCA strongly suggests that CMV is an essential factor in the NK cell activation, which progresses stepwise during leukemia and subsequent dasatinib treatment most likely by subclinical CMV reactivation.

The Influence of Glycodendrimer on Apoptosis in In Vitro B-CLL Cells Defined by Microarrays.,102-114,,"BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells are characterized by failures in the apoptosis pathway and increased proliferation, resulting in the progressive accumulation of B-lymphocytes in blood. Despite the wide range of antileukaemic drugs, CLL remains an incurable disease. However, a breakthrough is expected which will allow more effective treatment. OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the influence of poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimer with peripheral amino groups, 30% of which were coated with maltotriose (PPI-G4-OS-Mal-III), on CLL cells, and demonstrates that it acts through the induction of the apoptotic mechanism. It is important to note that the dendrimer was used as a drug itself and not as a drug carrier. METHOD: CLL and normal lymphocytes were treated in vitro with the dendrimer, either alone or in combination with fludarabine (FA). The percentages of apoptotic and necrotic cells, and the protein expression, were checked using a flow cytometer. Gene expression was screened using a two-colour microarray with 60-mer probes. RESULTS: The results confirm that PPI-G4-OS-Mal-III influences the viability of CLL cells in vitro and does not exert any significant harmful effect on normal lymphocytes. The dendrimer appears to significantly influence gene and protein expression in CLL cells. CONCLUSION: Since dendrimers can be specifically targeted, they may be very effective in CLL therapy, especially since in vitro PPI-G4-OS-Mal-III has been found to have stronger effect than fludarabine.",,"['Franiak-Pietryga, Ida', 'Ziolkowska, Ewelina', 'Ziemba, Barbara', 'Appelhans, Dietmar', 'Maciejewski, Henryk', 'Voit, Brigitte', 'Kaczmarek, Aleksandra', 'Robak, Tadeusz', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz, Barbara', 'Cebula-Obrzut, Barbara', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Borowiec, Maciej', 'Bryszewska, Maria']","['Franiak-Pietryga I', 'Ziolkowska E', 'Ziemba B', 'Appelhans D', 'Maciejewski H', 'Voit B', 'Kaczmarek A', 'Robak T', 'Klajnert-Maculewicz B', 'Cebula-Obrzut B', 'Smolewski P', 'Borowiec M', 'Bryszewska M']",,"['Department of Clinical and Laboratory Genetics, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dendrimers)', '0 (Polypropylenes)', '0 (Trisaccharides)', '0 (poly(propyleneimine))', '639K0T34IK (maltotriose)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dendrimers/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polypropylenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Trisaccharides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",,2016/06/29 06:00,2017/06/02 06:00,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2015/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2016/06/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['ACAMC-EPUB-76733 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2017;17(1):102-114.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we explored the role of the TCR adaptor protein slp-76 on iNKT-cell biology. Compared to B6 controls, slp-76(ace/ace) mice carrying a missense mutation (Thr428Ile) within the SH2-domain of slp-76 showed an increase in iNKT cells in the thymus and lymph nodes, but a decrease in iNKT cells in spleens and livers, along with reduced ADAP expression and cytokine response. A comparable reduction in iNKT cells was observed in the livers and spleens of ADAP-deficient mice. Like ADAP(-/-) iNKT cells, slp-76(ace/ace) iNKT cells were characterized by enhanced CD11b expression, correlating with an impaired induction of the TCR immediate-early gene Nur77 and a decreased adhesion to ICAM-1. Furthermore, CD11b-intrinsic effects inhibited cytokine release, concanavalin A-mediated inflammation, and iNKT-cell accumulation in the liver. Unlike B6 and ADAP(-/-) mice, the expression of the transcription factors Id3 and PLZF was reduced, whereas NP-1-expression was enhanced in slp-76(ace/ace) mice.

We demonstrated that CA1P has outstanding anti-cancer activity against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in vitro and in vivo. As determined by fluorescence staining and western blots (WBs), CA1P induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and apoptosis in HepG2 cells with a down-regulation of Mcl-1. Additional studies indicated that CA1P induced microtubule depolymerization-mediated AKT inactivation, which resulted in GSK-3beta activation, Wnt/beta-Catenin pathway inhibition, and Mcl-1 down-regulation. The induction of HepG2 cell apoptosis by CA1P was prevented by a GSK-3beta-specific inhibitor. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies on hepatocellular carcinoma mouse models showed that CA1P had activity against tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). CA1P induced TAM apoptosis in vitro through the same mechanism observed with HepG2 cells, and it eliminated TAMs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in vivo. In TME, the expression of TGF-beta and TNF-alpha was also altered. The adoptive transfer of macrophages partly rescued the growth of tumor inhibited by CA1P. These findings indicate that CA1P has great potential to impact both cancer cells and the microenvironment, and our results should accelerate the application of CA1P for HCC therapy in clinic.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We used functionalized graphene oxide (GO) to detect the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor, alpha fusion gene (PML/RARalpha fusion gene) in bone marrow of APL patients. This method was more convenient and time-saving, and we can obtain the detection results in 1 hour. METHODS: Our group consists of 36 cases, among them are 16 cases which are PML-RARalpha positive, 20 cases which are PML-RARalpha negative. Firstly, samples were fixed, drilled, and incubated with antibody CD45. Secondly, GO, fluorescent probes, and buffer liquid were added. One hour later, samples were washed with PBS (1 x) buffer, centrifuged, and fluorescent signals were detected with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Using functional GO to carry the fluorescent probe we ascertained whether bone marrow samples contain the L type PML/RARalpha fusion gene. Using the probe, only cells which contain L type PML/RARalpha fusion gene will have fluorescent signals compared to no signals (p < 0.05). The GO detection method was accurate and has clinical diagnostic values (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The GO detection method has the advantages of accurate, time-saving, energy-saving simple operation, and no pollution.",,"['Li, Ran', 'Tan, Yanhong', 'Chen, Xiuhua', 'Ren, Fanggang', 'Zhang, Yaofang', 'Wang, Hongwei']","['Li R', 'Tan Y', 'Chen X', 'Ren F', 'Zhang Y', 'Wang H']",,,['eng'],,"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '7782-42-5 (Graphite)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', '*Fluorescent Dyes', '*Gene Fusion', '*Graphite', 'Humans', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",,2016/06/29 06:00,2016/07/28 06:00,['2016/06/29 06:00'],"['2016/06/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/clin.lab.2015.150819 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2016;62(5):823-31. doi: 10.7754/clin.lab.2015.150819.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, phenolic profile of the seed coat extracts from 10 differently colored European varieties has been determined using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-linear trap quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometer technique. Extracts of dark colored varieties with high total phenolic content (up to 46.56 mg GAE/g) exhibited strong antioxidant activities (measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl or DPPH assay, and ferric ion reducing and ferrous ion chelating capacity assays) which could be attributed to presence of gallic acid, epigallocatechin, naringenin, and apigenin. The aqueous extracts of dark colored varieties exert concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects on all tested malignant cell lines (human colon adenocarcinoma LS174, human breast carcinoma MDA-MB-453, human lung carcinoma A594, and myelogenous leukemia K562). Correlation analysis revealed that intensities of cytotoxic activity of the extracts strongly correlated with contents of epigallocatechin and luteolin. Cell cycle analysis on LS174 cells in the presence of caspase-3 inhibitor points out that extracts may activate other cell death modalities besides caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. The study provides evidence that seed coat extracts of dark colored pea varieties might be used as potential cancer-chemopreventive and complementary agents in cancer therapy.",,"['Stanisavljevic, Nemanja S', 'Ilic, Marija D', 'Matic, Ivana Z', 'Jovanovic, Zivko S', 'Cupic, Tihomir', 'Dabic, Dragana C', 'Natic, Maja M', 'Tesic, Zivoslav Lj']","['Stanisavljevic NS', 'Ilic MD', 'Matic IZ', 'Jovanovic ZS', 'Cupic T', 'Dabic DC', 'Natic MM', 'Tesic ZLj']",,"['a Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'a Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'b Faculty of Chemistry , University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'c Institute of Oncology and Radiology of Serbia , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'a Institute of Molecular Genetics and Genetic Engineering, University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'd Agricultural Institute Osijek , Osijek , Croatia.', 'e Innovation Center , Faculty of Chemistry Ltd, University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'b Faculty of Chemistry , University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.', 'b Faculty of Chemistry , University of Belgrade , Belgrade , Serbia.']",['eng'],,"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20160627,United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Pigments, Biological)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', '7V515PI7F6 (Apigenin)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'HEJ6575V1X (gallocatechol)', 'HN5425SBF2 (naringenin)', 'KUX1ZNC9J2 (Luteolin)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*analysis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Antioxidants/*analysis/metabolism', 'Apigenin/analysis/metabolism', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival', 'Croatia', 'Crops, Agricultural/chemistry/metabolism', 'Dietary Supplements/analysis', 'Flavanones/analysis/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/*analysis/metabolism', 'Gallic Acid/analysis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron Chelating Agents/analysis/metabolism', 'Luteolin/analysis/metabolism', 'Peas/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Phenols/*analysis/metabolism', 'Pigments, Biological/biosynthesis', 'Plant Epidermis/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/metabolism', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Seeds/*chemistry/metabolism']",,2016/06/28 06:00,2017/12/14 06:00,['2016/06/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/12/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2016.1190019 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2016 Aug-Sep;68(6):988-1000. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2016.1190019.

To improve its utility, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness optimization of analytical methods, especially those that translate to clinically relevant outcomes, is critical. Here we define a novel tool for genomic analysis termed a biomedical robot in order to improve phenotype prediction, identifying disease pathogenesis and significantly defining therapeutic targets. Biomedical robot analytics differ from historical methods in that they are based on melding feature selection methods and ensemble learning techniques. The biomedical robot mathematically exploits the structure of the uncertainty space of any classification problem conceived as an ill-posed optimization problem. Given a classifier, there exist different equivalent small-scale genetic signatures that provide similar predictive accuracies. We perform the sensitivity analysis to noise of the biomedical robot concept using synthetic microarrays perturbed by different kinds of noises in expression and class assignment. Finally, we show the application of this concept to the analysis of different diseases, inferring the pathways and the correlation networks. The final aim of a biomedical robot is to improve knowledge discovery and provide decision systems to optimize diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. This analysis shows that the biomedical robots are robust against different kinds of noises and particularly to a wrong class assignment of the samples.

In myeloid leukemia, MUC1 has been shown to have an essential role in leukemia stem-cell function, the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the promotion of terminal myeloid differentiation. As such, MUC1 is an attractive therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies. Targeting MUC1 has been shown to be an effective approach for inducing cell death in tumor in in vivo and in vitro models.

We have previously shown how the combination of two redeployed drugs, the contraceptive steroid medroxyprogesterone and the lipid-regulating drug bezafibrate exert anti-leukaemic effects by producing ROS. Here we report a (13)C-tracer-based NMR metabolic study to understand how these drugs work in K562 leukaemia cells. Our study shows that [1,2-(13)C]glucose is incorporated into ribose sugars, indicating activity in oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways alongside lactate production. There is little label incorporation into the tricarboxylic acid cycle from glucose, but much greater incorporation arises from the use of [3-(13)C]glutamine. The combined medroxyprogesterone and bezafibrate treatment decreases label incorporation from both glucose and glutamine into alpha-ketoglutarate and increased that for succinate, which is consistent with ROS-mediated conversion of alpha-ketoglutarate to succinate.

GWAS data (accession no., pha002874.1) were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database of Genotypes and Phenotypes, which included data concerning 1,896 patients with PC and 1,939 control individuals. Gene expression data [accession no., GSE23952; human pancreatic carcinoma Panc-1 transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) treatment assay] were downloaded from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to identify significant pathways in the GWAS or gene expression profiles. Meta-analysis was performed based on pathway analysis of the two data sources. In total, 58 and 280 pathways were identified to be significant in the GWAS and gene expression data, respectively, with 7 pathways significant in both the data profiles. Hsa 04350 TGF-beta signaling pathway had the smallest meta P-value. Other significant pathways in the two data sources were negative regulation of DNA-dependent transcription, the nucleolus, negative regulation of RNA metabolic process, the cellular defense response, exocytosis and galactosyltransferase activity. By constructing the gene-pathway network, 5 pathways were closely associated, apart from exocytosis and galactosyltransferase activity pathways. Among the 7 pathways, 11 key genes (2.9% out of a total of 380 genes) from the GWAS data and 43 genes (10.5% out of a total of 409 genes) from the gene expression data were differentially expressed. Only Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 from the nucleolus pathway was significantly expressed in by both data sources.

The present retrospective study intended to characterize t-AML patients that were diagnosed and treated in a single referral to an oncological institution in North Portugal. Over the past 10 years, 231 cases of AML were diagnosed and treated at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Porto, of which 38 t-AML cases were identified. Data regarding the patient demographics, primary diagnosis and treatment, age at onset of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, latency time of the neoplasm, cytogenetic characteristics, AML therapy and outcome were collected from medical records. A previous diagnosis with solid tumors was present in 28 patients, and 10 patients possessed a history of hematological conditions, all a lymphoproliferative disorder. Breast cancer was the most frequent solid tumor identified (39.5% of all solid tumors diagnosed). The mean latency time was 3 years. In the present study, t-AML patients were older (P<0.001) and more frequently carried cytogenetic abnormalities (P=0.009) compared with de novo AML patients. The overall survival time was observed to be significantly poorer among individuals with t-AML (P<0.001). However, in younger patients (age, <50 years) there was no difference between the overall survival time of patients with t-AML and those with de novo AML (P=0.983).

The gene function loss caused by aberrant methylation is analogous to genetic mutations. Unlike genetic mutations, epigenetic alterations can be reversed. 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of certain types of cancer, such as MDS and leukemia. The aim of the present study was to determine whether 5-aza-CdR has the potential to be used in the treatment of colon cancer using a human Caco-2 colonic carcinoma cell line. The effect of 5-aza-CdR on cell proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and reversal of aberrant methylation of the Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A) gene was also examined. The 5-aza-CdR was prepared at different concentrations in sterile tri-distilled water at 0.4, 1.6, 6.4, 25.6 and 102.4 micromol/l and employed to treat the human Caco-2 colonic carcinoma cells. An MTT assay was used to detect the effect of 5-aza-CdR on cell proliferation. Flow cytometry was used to examine the cell cycle and apoptosis. The RASSF1A mRNA transcript level was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that 5-aza-CdR inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (p<0.01). The 5-aza-CdR treatment affected the cell cycle and caused accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase and this effect was concentration-dependent (p<0.05). 5-aza-CdR treatment caused an increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis and reactivated the RASSF1A tumor suppressor gene that was silenced by hypermethylation in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, 5-aza-CdR inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis in Caco-2 cells by upregulating the epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor RASSF1A gene.",,"['Li, Xiumei', 'Qin, Bingzhao', 'Liu, B O']","['Li X', 'Qin B', 'Liu BO']",,"['Department of Gastroenterology, Xiangyang Hospital Affiliated to Hubei University of Medicine, Xiangyang, Hubei 441000, P.R.

Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the presence of cell cycle arrested and apoptotic cells. CecropinXJ significantly inhibited the growth of Huh-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CecropinXJ treatment for 24 h induced S cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in addition to loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential, in hepatoma cells. CecropinXJ induced HCC cell apoptosis by activating caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, cecropinXJ downregulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), while upregulated the expression of Bcl-2-associated death promoter and Bcl-2-associated X protein.

Plant homeodomain finger protein 6 (PHF6) has recently been established as a key tumor suppressor, which is mutated in T-ALL; however, the clinical significance of PHF6 mutations has not been fully determined in adult T-ALL. In the present study, amplification of the PHF6 exons was performed, followed by DNA sequencing to identify the genomic mutations and examine the expression of PHF6 in adult patients with T-ALL. The correlation between PHF6 mutations and clinical features was also analyzed using a chi(2) test, and between PHF6 mutations and survival curve using the Kaplan-Meier methods. PHF6 mutations were detected in 27.1% of the Chinese adults with T-ALL (16/59), 10 of which were found to be novel mutations. A significantly lower expression level of PHF6 was observed in T-ALL patients with PHF6 mutations compared with those without mutations. Of the observed mutations in PHF6, 6/16 were frame-shift mutations, indicating a PHF6 dysfunction in those patients. Of note, PHF6 mutations were found to be significantly associated with older age, lower hemoglobin levels, higher frequency of CD13 positivity and higher incidence of splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy. Furthermore, PHF6 mutations were found to be significantly correlated with Notch homolog 1, translocation-associated (Drosophila) (NOTCH1) mutations. The patients with T-ALL with co-existence of the two mutations had a significantly shorter event-free survival and a poor prognosis. The present results indicated that PHF6 is inactivated in adult T-ALL, due to its low expression and mutations.

The present study aimed to investigate the ability of G-CSF to overcome stromal-mediated drug resistance and the underlying molecular mechanism. Two types of co-culture models were established in the HS-5 human bone marrow/stromal and HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, in order to imitate the interactions between stromal and leukemia cells in vitro, which is mediated by the stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1alpha signaling axis. In the present study, HL-60 cells were attracted and adhered to HS-5 cells using migration assay and flow cytometry, respectively; however, these interactions were inhibited by treatment with G-CSF and/or the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) antagonist, AMD3100. Co-culture with HS-5 cells, including direct and indirect contact, protected HL-60 cells against spontaneous apoptosis or drug-induced apoptosis; however, these protective effects were disrupted by treatment with G-CSF and/or AMD3100. Notably, G-CSF and/or AMD3100 did not alter cell viability or apoptosis when HL-60 cells were cultured with medium alone. In addition, G-CSF significantly reduced the expression levels of surface CXCR4 protein, total CXCR4 protein and CXCR4 mRNA, and significantly upregulated the expression of microRNA (miR)-146a. Conversely, AMD3100 significantly reduced surface CXCR4 expression levels, but not the total CXCR4, CXCR4 mRNA or miR-146a expression levels. The results of the present study suggested that interfering with the CXCR4/SDF-1alpha signaling axis via G-CSF inhibited the migration and adhesion of HL-60 cells to HS-5 cells and eliminated HS5 cell-mediated protective effects. Furthermore, G-CSF administration reduced CXCR4 expression levels by upregulating the expression of miR-146a, whereas AMD3100 appeared to be predominantly dependent on receptor internalization. Therefore, a G-CSF/miR-146a/CXCR4 pathway may explain how G-CSF inhibits CXCR4/SDF-1alpha signaling and overcomes stromal cell-mediated drug resistance in acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Sheng, Xianfu', 'Zhong, Hua', 'Wan, Haixia', 'Zhong, Jihua', 'Chen, Fangyuan']","['Sheng X', 'Zhong H', 'Wan H', 'Zhong J', 'Chen F']",,"['Department of Hematology, Ren Ji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200127, P.R.

The diagnosis of HLH is based on clinical and biological criteria, such as those proposed by the Histiocyte Society. However, several of these criteria are not relevant in the specific setting of hematologic malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 69-year-old male was treated for an acute myeloid leukaemia. On day 15 after the start of chemotherapy, he developed severe sepsis with high fever, low blood pressure and hepatosplenomegaly. RESULTS: Blood tests were marked by extreme hyperferritinemia (191,000 microg/L, reference range: 26-388 microg/L) with increased C-reactive protein (87.0 mg/L) and procalcitonin (1.94 microg/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (499 U/L 37 degrees C) in the setting of chemotherapy-induced aplasia. This unusual extreme ferritinemia led to suspect HLH triggered by an invasive infection. Under intensive treatment, the clinical status improved and ferritin levels significantly decreased. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of HLH is usually based on clinical and biological criteria, mainly fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hemophagocytosis and hyperferritinemia. In this patient, the diagnosis of HLH was challenging because several criteria, such as hypertriglyceridemia, hemophagocytosis and hypofibrinogenemia, were absent. In addition, some criteria of HLH are not relevant in the setting of hematologic malignancy, in which fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias and elevated lactate dehydrogenase are commonly observed independently of HLH.

The motivation for this work was the successful conduct and positive final outcome of a three-arm randomized clinical trial primarily assessing whether obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with chronic lympocytic lymphoma and coexisting conditions is superior to chlorambucil alone based on a time-to-event endpoint. The inference strategy of this trial was based on a closed testing procedure. We compare this strategy to three potential alternatives to run a three-arm clinical trial with a time-to-event endpoint. The primary goal is to quantify the differences between these strategies in terms of the time it takes until the first analysis and thus potential approval of a new drug, number of required events, and power. Operational aspects of implementing the various strategies are discussed. In conclusion, using a closed testing procedure results in the shortest time to the first analysis with a minimal loss in power. Therefore, closed testing procedures should be part of the statistician's standard clinical trials toolbox when planning multiarm clinical trials.","['(c) 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This suggests a constitutional or inherited basis, and yet many of them do not fit the diagnostic criteria of the known BMF syndromes. Through exome sequencing, we have now identified a subgroup of these individuals, defined by germline biallelic mutations in DNAJC21 (DNAJ homolog subfamily C member 21). They present with global BMF, and one individual developed a hematological cancer (acute myeloid leukemia) in childhood. We show that the encoded protein associates with rRNA and plays a highly conserved role in the maturation of the 60S ribosomal subunit. Lymphoblastoid cells obtained from an affected individual exhibit increased sensitivity to the transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D and reduced amounts of rRNA. Characterization of mutations revealed impairment in interactions with cofactors (PA2G4, HSPA8, and ZNF622) involved in 60S maturation. DNAJC21 deficiency resulted in cytoplasmic accumulation of the 60S nuclear export factor PA2G4, aberrant ribosome profiles, and increased cell death. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that mutations in DNAJC21 cause a cancer-prone BMF syndrome due to corruption of early nuclear rRNA biogenesis and late cytoplasmic maturation of the 60S subunit.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

Colitis, sometimes hemorrhagic, has occasionally been described with the use of dasatinib for both chronic myeloid leukemia and Ph+ ALL. The pathogenesis of dasatinib-induced colitis is unclear but may be related to effects of dasatinib on immune function. We describe a series of 5 patients who had 7 episodes of colitis during dasatinib use. No patient had obvious large granular lymphocytosis in peripheral blood. The histopathologic and immunohistochemical features of these cases were indistinguishable from control cases of gut graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In all patients symptoms resolved upon discontinuation of dasatinib in addition to therapy with local or low-dose systemic steroids. An additional 3 patients who developed cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis while on dasatinib therapy were identified and studied. Dasatinib colitis may have an immune-mediated mechanism similar to GVHD, and dasatinib use may be associated with CMV colitis. Awareness of this association is important for avoiding unnecessary intensification of immunosuppression for suspected gut GVHD.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that MEIS2 is expressed at high levels in patients with AML1-ETO-positive acute myeloid leukemia and that growth of AML1-ETO-positive leukemia depends on MEIS2 expression. In mice, MEIS2 collaborates with AML1-ETO to induce acute myeloid leukemia. MEIS2 binds strongly to the Runt domain of AML1-ETO, indicating a direct interaction between these transcription factors. High expression of MEIS2 impairs repressive DNA binding of AML1-ETO, inducing increased expression of genes such as the druggable proto-oncogene YES1.

METHODS: Data related to province-specific disease burden in China was used to analyze and compare related parameters as incidence, mortality, the disability-adjusted life years (DALY), years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLL) and years lived with disability (YLD) on leukemia in China in 1990 and 2013. Standardized mortality rates of leukemia in each province in 2013 and the changes since 1990, were described. RESULTS: In 2013, the standardized incidence and mortality rates of leukemia in China were 6.70/100 000 and 4.05/100 000, with reduction of 8.84% and 36.22% when compared with those in 1990, respectively. The standardized DALY rate and YLL rate appeared as 174.58/100 000 and 170.42/100 000 in 2013, with 44.68% and 45.32% reduction, respectively, when compared with the figures in 1990. The standardized YLD rate of leukemia in 2013 was 4.16/100 000, with an 6.94% increase, comparing with that in 1990. Age-specific data showed that the proportion of people who died from leukemia among those who died from all the cancers was more than 10% in people under 35 years old. DALY rate of leukemia was highest among children aged 5 years old and under, which appeared as 317.61/100 000. Compared with those in 1990, the standardized mortality of leukemia appeared decreasing in all the provinces in 2013. The top three provinces with the highest standardized mortality of leukemia in 2013 were Xinjiang (4.72/100 000), Ningxia (4.56/100 000) and Fujian (4.50/100 000). CONCLUSIONS: Although the standardized incidence rate, mortality rate, DALY rate and YLL rate due to leukemia decreased, YLD rate due to leukemia increased. Proportions of children and adolescents who died from leukemia remained high. Although the standardized mortalities of leukemia decreased in all the provinces, the differences among them still remained.",,"['Wang, N', 'Feng, Y J', 'Wang, B H', 'Fang, L W', 'Cong, S', 'Li, Y C', 'Yin, P', 'Zhou, M G', 'Wang, L H']","['Wang N', 'Feng YJ', 'Wang BH', 'Fang LW', 'Cong S', 'Li YC', 'Yin P', 'Zhou MG', 'Wang LH']",,"['Division of Cancer Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Cancer Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Integrated Prevention and Evaluation, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'Division of Vital Statistics and Death Surveillance, National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.', 'National Center for Chronic and Noncommunicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Beijing 100050, China.']",['chi'],,['Journal Article'],,China,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,8208604,,IM,"['Adult', 'Asians', 'China', 'Disabled Persons', 'Humans', 'Incidence', '*Leukemia', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Reference Standards', 'Tumor Burden']",,2016/06/28 06:00,2017/05/27 06:00,['2016/06/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2016.06.008 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhonghua Liu Xing Bing Xue Za Zhi. 2016 Jun;37(6):783-7. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.0254-6450.2016.06.008.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the function of LARG in murine and human megakaryocytes and platelets with Larg knockout (KO), shRNA-mediated knockdown and small molecule-mediated inhibition. We found that LARG is important for human, but not murine, megakaryocyte maturation. Larg KO mice exhibit macrothrombocytopenia, internal bleeding in the ovaries and prolonged bleeding times. KO platelets have impaired aggregation, alpha-granule release and integrin alpha2bbeta3 activation in response to thrombin and thromboxane, but not to ADP. The same agonist-specific reductions in platelet aggregation occur in human platelets treated with a LARG inhibitor. Larg KO platelets have reduced RhoA activation and myosin light chain phosphorylation, suggesting that Larg plays an agonist-specific role in platelet signal transduction. Using two different in vivo assays, Larg KO mice are protected from in vivo thrombus formation. Together, these results establish that LARG regulates human megakaryocyte maturation, and is critical for platelet function in both humans and mice.",,"['Zou, Siying', 'Teixeira, Alexandra M', 'Yin, Mingzhu', 'Xiang, Yaozu', 'Xavier-Ferrucio, Juliana', 'Zhang, Ping-Xia', 'Hwa, John', 'Min, Wang', 'Krause, Diane S']","['Zou S', 'Teixeira AM', 'Yin M', 'Xiang Y', 'Xavier-Ferrucio J', 'Zhang PX', 'Hwa J', 'Min W', 'Krause DS']",,"['Diane S.

The process of attachment and fusion in retroviruses is mediated by a single viral envelope glycoprotein (Env). Conformational changes of Env in the course of fusion are a focus of intense studies. Here we provide further insight into the changes occurring in retroviral Env during its initial interaction with the cell, employing murine leukemia virus (MLV) as model system. We first determined the structure of both natively membrane anchored MLV Env and MLV Env tagged with YFP in the proline rich region (PRR) by electron cryo tomography (cET) and sub-volume averaging. At a resolution of approximately 20A, native MLV Env presents as a hollow trimer (height approximately 85A, diameter approximately 120A) composed of step-shaped protomers. The major difference to the YFP-tagged protein was in regions outside of the central trimer. Next, we focused on elucidating the changes in MLV Env upon interaction with a host cell. Virus interaction with the plasma membrane occurred over a large surface and Env clustering on the binding site was observed. Sub-volume averaging did yield a low-resolution structure of Env interacting with the cell, which had lost its threefold symmetry and was elongated by approximately 35A in comparison to the unbound protein. This indicates a major rearrangement of Env upon host cell binding. At the site of virus interaction, the otherwise clearly defined bilayer structure of the host cell plasma membrane was much less evident, indicative of integral membrane protein accumulation and/or a change in membrane lipid composition.",['Copyright (c) 2016 The Author(s).

Although this is a relatively evidence-poor area, the recommended clinical management of high-grade transformation differs considerably from that of relapsed CLL. The 'CHOP-OR' trial was a single-arm, multicentre, non-randomized phase II National Cancer Research Institute trial in patients with newly diagnosed RS, recruited from across the UK from April 2011 to December 2014. Forty-three patients were enrolled, of whom 37 were ultimately evaluable for response. The aim was to verify the presence of RS in the trial patients and identify pitfalls in the diagnosis of RS. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two independent, specialist haematopathologists reviewed histological material from 40 available cases enrolled in the CHOP-OR trial to determine whether the submitted diagnosis of RS was correct. Three cases were unavailable for central review. This series represents the largest central review of RS within a prospective trial in the literature to date. Thirty-three of the 40 (82.5%) submitted cases showed features consistent with WHO-defined RS. Reasons for diagnostic uncertainty in discrepant cases included large proliferation centres, variably confluent and serpiginous proliferation centres, and an apparently high proliferation index, sometimes attributable to a thick section or associated normal bone marrow proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the importance of high-quality histological and immunohistochemical sections and strict adherence to WHO criteria in the diagnosis of RS. This study further reinforces the importance of centralized review of cases of haematological malignancy.",['(c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Soilleux, Elizabeth J', 'Wotherspoon, Andrew', 'Eyre, Toby A', 'Clifford, Ruth', 'Cabes, Maite', 'Schuh, Anna H']","['Soilleux EJ', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Eyre TA', 'Clifford R', 'Cabes M', 'Schuh AH']",,"['Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Histopathology, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Early Phase Clinical Trial Unit, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'NIHR BRC Oxford Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'NIHR BRC Oxford Molecular Diagnostic Centre, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20160909,England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Aged', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2016/06/28 06:00,2017/06/14 06:00,['2016/06/28 06:00'],"['2016/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/his.13024 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2016 Dec;69(6):1066-1076. doi: 10.1111/his.13024.

This study evaluated associations between uric acid (UA), cardiovascular health, and neurocognitive function in adolescent and adult survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with chemotherapy only. METHODS: 126 adolescent [mean (SD) age 14.6 (5.0); 7.8 (1.7) years postdiagnosis] and 226 adult survivors [age 25.4 (4.2) years; 18.1 (4.4) years postdiagnosis] completed comprehensive neurocognitive testing. Concurrent UA measurements were conducted for both groups. For adult survivors, cardiovascular risk factors were assessed, and UA measurements during adolescence [12.3 (4.0) years before neurocognitive testing] were also collected. UA levels were categorized into quartiles for age- and gender-based ranking, and associations with neurocognitive outcomes were examined. RESULTS: Survivors demonstrated worse attention, processing speed, and executive functions than population norms (P values < 0.05). Adolescent survivors with elevated UA had poorer attention (P = 0.04), visual-processing speed (P = 0.03), and cognitive flexibility (P = 0.02). UA was not associated with neurocognitive outcomes in adult survivors. Adult survivors developed dyslipidemia (46%), hypertension (32%), and abdominal obesity (26%), and high UA during adolescence was associated with these cardiovascular risk factors as adults (all P values < 0.01). Fine-motor processing speed was slower in adult survivors with dyslipidemia (P = 0.04) and abdominal obesity (P = 0.04). Poorer attention was marginally associated with hypertension (P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated UA is associated with neurocognitive performance in adolescent survivors. In adult survivors, relative elevation of UA during adolescence was predictive of cardiovascular health, which was associated with poorer neurocognitive outcomes. IMPACT: Future studies should evaluate the mediating role of chronic cardiovascular health conditions between elevated UA and subsequent neurocognitive impairment in survivors.

This diagnosis is quite challenging as the histopathological findings are nonspecific. Pyoderma gangrenosum is usually associated with inflammatory bowel disease, leukemia, and hepatitis C. We describe a rare clinical case of a patient with hepatitis C (HCV), mixed cryoglubinemia, and pyoderma gangrenosum, which was successfully treated with prednisone in combination with the new antiviral medication ledipasvir/sofosbuvir. CASE REPORT: A 68-year-old male with a history of untreated HCV presented to the clinic with a left lower extremity ulcer that had progressively worsened over 4 days after the patient sustained a minor trauma to the left lower extremity. Examination revealed a 2x3 cm purulent ulcer with an erythematous rim on medial aspect of his left lower leg. HCV viral load and genotype analysis revealed genotype 1A with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showing viral counts of 9,506,048 and cryoglobulinemia. With a worsening and enlarging erythematous ulcer and failure of IV antibiotic therapy, the patient underwent skin biopsy, which showed acanthotic epidermis with superficial and deep perivascular lymphoplasmacytic dermatitis admixed with mild neutrophilic infiltrate. The patient was subsequently started on ledipasvir/sofosbuvir and prednisone with a high suspicion of pyoderma gangrenosum. At one-month follow-up at the hepatology clinic, the patient demonstrated a near resolution of the lower extremity ulcer with undetectable viral load. CONCLUSIONS: Pyoderma gangrenosum is an inflammatory process of unknown etiology, and establishing the correct diagnosis can be a difficult task. For this reason it is prudent for clinicians to consider Pyoderma gangrenosum in their differential diagnosis, especially in the setting of a nonhealing surgical wound or skin infection.",,"['Pourmorteza, Mohsen', 'Tawadros, Fady', 'Bader, Gilbert', 'Al-Tarawneh, Mohamed', 'Cook, Emilie', 'Shams, Wael', 'Young, Mark']","['Pourmorteza M', 'Tawadros F', 'Bader G', 'Al-Tarawneh M', 'Cook E', 'Shams W', 'Young M']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, East Tennessee State University, Johnson City, TN, USA.']",['eng'],,"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20160627,United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (ledipasvir, sofosbuvir drug combination)', 'E2OU15WN0N (Uridine Monophosphate)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'WJ6CA3ZU8B (Sofosbuvir)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/therapeutic use', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*drug therapy', 'Fluorenes/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis C, Chronic/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', 'Pyoderma Gangrenosum/*drug therapy', 'Sofosbuvir', 'Uridine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Viral Load']",PMC4924887,2016/06/28 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2016/06/28 06:00'],"['2016/06/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['898611 [pii]', '10.12659/ajcr.898611 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2016 Jun 27;17:434-8. doi: 10.12659/ajcr.898611.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-one patients with myeloid malignancies not in remission were included in this study. Their median age was 59 years (range, 19 to 70 years), with a median hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific comorbidity index score of 3. With a median observation period of 39.6 months (range, 24.3 to 90.8 months) among the survivors, overall survival and progression-free survival at 2 years were both 54.9%. Forty-six of 51 achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 19.5 days (range, 13 to 38 days) after transplantation, with a cumulative incidence of 90.2%. No patient developed graft rejection in this study. All patients who achieved engraftment showed hematological complete remission with complete donor chimerism. Eleven patients relapsed at a median of 4.9 months (range, .5 to 26.7 months). Cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days and 2 years were 11.8% and 25.5%, respectively. In conclusion, the present results show that the novel conditioning regimen for single CBT provided durable engraftment and remission with acceptable NRM leading to excellent survival, even for a relatively older population with myeloid malignancies not in remission.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) provides a theoretical cure for hematologic risks (BMF, AML), but it introduces uncertain risks of transplantation-related mortality (TRM) and carcinogenicity. We developed a mathematical (Markov) decision model to estimate event-free survival (EFS) conditional on age based on per-year cause-specific hazard rates. We assumed that preemptive (PE) BMT eliminates the risks of BMF and AML, but it may introduce independent risks of TRM or influence the trajectory to ST. Our model suggested that the expected mean EFS in FA is higher for PE-BMT at young ages, with minimal risk of TRM and with little carcinogenicity. PE-BMT in adults decreased expected EFS because of the greater competing risk of ST in adulthood. Estimates of EFS conditioned on attained age may be used in shared decision-making when clinicians must counsel patients using limited data.

Here, we report that the DNMT3A mutational hotspot at Arg882 (DNMT3A(R882H)) cooperates with NRAS mutation to transform hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells and induce acute leukemia development. Mechanistically, DNMT3A(R882H) directly binds to and potentiates transactivation of stemness genes critical for leukemogenicity including Meis1, Mn1, and Hoxa gene cluster. DNMT3A(R882H) induces focal epigenetic alterations, including CpG hypomethylation and concurrent gain of active histone modifications, at cis-regulatory elements such as enhancers to facilitate gene transcription. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of a putative Meis1 enhancer carrying DNMT3A(R882H)-induced DNA hypomethylation impairs Meis1 expression. Importantly, DNMT3A(R882H)-induced gene-expression programs can be repressed through Dot1l inhibition, providing an attractive therapeutic strategy for DNMT3A-mutated leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we synthesized a novel tubulin polymerization inhibitor, MPT0B206 (N-[1-(4-methoxy-benzenesulfonyl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-indol-7-yl]-formamide), and demonstrated its apoptotic effect and mechanism in imatinib-sensitive K562 and imatinib-resistant K562R CML cells. Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that MPT0B206 induced microtubule depolymerization in K562 and K562R cells. MPT0B206 inhibited the growth of these cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. It did not affect the viability of normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells. MPT0B206 induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and the appearance of the mitotic marker MPM-2 in K562 and K562R cells, which is associated with the upregulation of cyclin B1 and the dephosphorylation of Cdc2. Treatment of K562 and K562R cells with MPT0B206 induced apoptosis and reduced the protein levels of procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 and increased caspase-3 activity and PARP cleavage. MPT0B206 also reduced the levels of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 and increased the level of the apoptotic protein Bax. Additional experiments showed that MPT0B206 markedly downregulated Bcr-Abl mRNA expression and total and phosphorylated Bcr-Abl protein levels and inhibited the phosphorylation of its downstream proteins STAT5, MAPK, and AKT, and the protein level of c-Myc in K562 and K562R cells. Furthermore, MPT0B206 triggered viability reduction and apoptosis in CML cells carrying T315I-mutated Bcr-Abl.

Inhibition of the metabolism of glucose but also of glutamine is thus proposed as a therapeutic modality to block leukemia cell growth. Since glucose also supports protein glycosylation, we wondered whether part of the growth inhibitory effects resulting from glycolysis inhibition could indirectly result from a defect in glycosylation of glutamine transporters. We found that ASCT2/SLC1A5, a major glutamine transporter, was indeed deglycosylated upon glucose deprivation and 2-deoxyglucose exposure in HL-60 and K-562 leukemia cells. Inhibition of glycosylation by these modalities as well as by the bona fide glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin however marginally influenced glutamine transport and did not impact on ASCT2 subcellular location. This work eventually unraveled the dispensability of ASCT2 to support HL-60 and K-562 leukemia cell growth and identified the upregulation of the neutral amino acid antiporter LAT1/SLC7A5 as a mechanism counteracting the inhibition of glycosylation. Pharmacological inhibition of LAT1 increased the growth inhibitory effects and the inactivation of the mTOR pathway resulting from glycosylation defects, an effect further emphasized during the regrowth period post-treatment with tunicamycin. In conclusion, this study points towards the underestimated impact of glycosylation inhibition in the interpretation of metabolic alterations resulting from glycolysis inhibition, and identifies LAT1 as a therapeutic target to prevent compensatory mechanisms induced by alterations in the glycosylating process.",,"['Polet, Florence', 'Martherus, Ruben', 'Corbet, Cyril', 'Pinto, Adan', 'Feron, Olivier']","['Polet F', 'Martherus R', 'Corbet C', 'Pinto A', 'Feron O']",,"['Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institut de Recherche Experimentale et Clinique (IREC), Universite Catholique de Louvain, B-1200 Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],,['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System ASC)', '0 (Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (SLC1A5 protein, human)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System ASC/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glutamine/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC5216804,2016/06/28 06:00,2018/01/30 06:00,['2016/06/27 06:00'],"['2016/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2016/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/01/30 06:00 [medline]', '2016/06/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10131 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.10131 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2016 Jul 19;7(29):46371-46383. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.10131.,['NOTNLM'],"['ASCT2', 'LAT1', 'glycosylation', 'leukemia', 'metabolism']",,['The authors declare no competing interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the clinical efficacy accomplished by TKIs therapies, disease progression may affect patient response rate to these inhibitors due to a multitude of factors that could lead to development of a mechanism known as multidrug resistance (MDR). 7-Ketocholesterol (7KC) is an oxidized cholesterol derivative that has been extensively reported to cause cell death in a variety of cancer models. In this study, we showed the in vitro efficacy of 7KC against MDR leukemia cell line, Lucena. 7KC treatment induced reduction in cell viability, together with apoptosis-mediated cell death. Moreover, downregulation of MDR protein caused intracellular drug accumulation and 7KC co-incubation with either Daunorubicin or Vincristine reduced cell viability compared to the use of each drug alone. Additionally, quantitative label-free mass spectrometry-based protein quantification showed alteration of different molecular pathways involved in cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and misfolded protein response. Conclusively, this study highlights the effect of 7KC as a sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance CML and elucidates its molecular mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE: CML patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have showed a 5-year estimated overall survival of 89%, with cumulative complete cytogenetic response of 87%. However, development of drug resistance is a common feature of the disease progression. This study aimed at showing the effect of 7KC as a cytotoxic and sensitizing agent of multidrug resistance CML cell lines. The cellular and molecular basis of this compound were elucidated using a comprehensive strategy based on quantitative proteomic and cell biology assays. We showed that 7KC induced cell death and overcomes drug resistance in CML through mechanisms that go beyond the classical MDR1 pathways.",['Copyright (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Retrospective studies demonstrate comparable outcomes among different graft sources. However, the risk and types of infections have not been compared among graft sources. Such information may influence the choice of a particular graft source. We compared the incidence of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in 1781 adults with acute leukemia who received alternative donor HCT (UCB, n= 568; MUD, n = 930; MMUD, n = 283) between 2008 and 2011. The incidences of bacterial infection at 1 year were 72%, 59%, and 65% (P < .0001) for UCB, MUD, and MMUD, respectively. Incidences of viral infection at 1 year were 68%, 45%, and 53% (P < .0001) for UCB, MUD, and MMUD, respectively. In multivariable analysis, bacterial, fungal, and viral infections were more common after either UCB or MMUD than after MUD (P < .0001). Bacterial and viral but not fungal infections were more common after UCB than MMUD (P = .0009 and <.0001, respectively). The presence of viral infection was not associated with an increased mortality. Overall survival (OS) was comparable among UCB and MMUD patients with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) >/= 90% but was inferior for UCB for patients with KPS < 90%. Bacterial and fungal infections were associated with poorer OS. Future strategies focusing on infection prevention and treatment are indicated to improve HCT outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2016 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

SUMO attachment is executed by the hierarchical action of E1, E2 and E3 enzymes of which E3 ligases ensure substrate specificity. We recently identified the ZNF451 family as novel class of SUMO2/3 specific E3 ligases and characterized their function in SUMO chain formation. The founding member, ZNF451isoform1 (ZNF451-1) partially resides in PML bodies, nuclear structures organized by the promyelocytic leukemia gene product PML. As PML and diverse PML components are well known SUMO substrates the question arises whether ZNF451-1 is involved in their sumoylation. Here, we show that ZNF451-1 indeed functions as SUMO2/3 specific E3 ligase for PML and selected PML components in vitro. Mutational analysis indicates that substrate sumoylation employs an identical biochemical mechanism as we described for SUMO chain formation. In vivo, ZNF451-1 RNAi depletion leads to PML stabilization and an increased number of PML bodies. By contrast, PML degradation upon arsenic trioxide treatment is not ZNF451-1 dependent.

Omega-3 supplementation is common to use during pregnancy, for its antioxidant and membrane stabilising effect. In this study we have aimed to study the effect of Omega-3 supplementation on implantation in a mouse model by immunohistochemical methods and electron microscopic evaluation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were randomized into three groups to receive standard food, Omega-3 400 mg/kg and Omega-3 1000 mg/kg one menstrual cycle before mating. Mice were sacrificed on third day of estimated implantation and uterine horns were evaluated immunohistochemically for staining of Laminin and Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) and ultrastructural morphology. RESULTS: Laminin and LIF immunoreactivity were increased signifcantly in the high dose group when compared to the control and low-dose groups in lumen epithelium basal membrane, gland epithelium basal membrane and endometrial stroma. Electron-microscopic evaluation showed a decrease in epithelial height and microvilli loss in the high dose groups. CONCLUSION: Omega-3 supplementation increased implantation markers Laminin and LIF and decreased epithelial height and microvilli thus seems to prepare the endometrium for a favorable environment of implantation.",['Copyright (c) 2016.

By selectively inhibiting BCL-2, venetoclax circumvents the dose-limiting, BCL-XL-mediated thrombocytopenia of its less selective predecessor navitoclax, while enhancing efficacy in CLL. We have previously reported the potent sensitivity of many high-risk childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) xenografts to navitoclax. Given the superior tolerability of venetoclax, here we have investigated its efficacy in childhood ALL. We demonstrate that in contrast to the clear dependence of CLL on BCL-2 alone, effective antileukemic activity in the majority of ALL xenografts requires concurrent inhibition of both BCL-2 and BCL-XL We identify BCL-XL expression as a key predictor of poor response to venetoclax and demonstrate that concurrent inhibition of both BCL-2 and BCL-XL results in synergistic killing in the majority of ALL xenografts. A notable exception is mixed lineage leukemia-rearranged infant ALL, where venetoclax largely recapitulates the activity of navitoclax, identifying this subgroup of patients as potential candidates for clinical trials of venetoclax in childhood ALL.

The two major Fv1 alleles from laboratory mice, Fv1 (n) and Fv1 (b) , restrict infection by different murine leukaemia viruses (MLVs). Fv1(n) restricts B-tropic MLV, but not N-tropic MLV or NB-tropic MLV. In cells expressing Fv1(b) at natural levels, only N-MLV is restricted, however restriction of NB-MLV and partial restriction of B-MLV were observed when recombinant Fv1(b) was expressed from an MLV promoter in Fv1 null Mus dunni tail fibroblast cells. To investigate the relationship between expression level and restriction specificity we have developed new retroviral delivery vectors which allow inducible expression of Fv1, and yet allow sufficient production of fluorescent reporter proteins for analysis in our FACS-based restriction assay. RESULTS: We demonstrated that at concentrations close to the endogenous expression level, Fv1(b) specifically restricts only N-MLV, but restriction of NB-MLV, and to a lesser extent B-MLV, could be gained by increasing the protein level of Fv1(b). By contrast, we found that even when Fv1(n) is expressed at very high levels, no significant inhibition of N-MLV or NB-MLV could be observed. Study of Fv1 mutants using this assay led to the identification of determinants for N/B tropism at an expression level close to that of endogenous Fv1(n) and Fv1(b). We also compared the recently described restriction activities of wild mice Fv1 proteins directed against non-MLV retroviruses when expressed at different levels. Fv1 from M. spretus restricted N-MLV, B-MLV and equine infectious anaemia virus equally even at low concentrations, while Fv1 from M. macedonicus showed even stronger restriction against equine infectious anaemia virus than to N-MLV. Restriction of feline foamy virus by Fv1 of M. caroli occurred at levels equivalent to MLV restriction. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that for some but not all Fv1 proteins, gain of restriction activities could be achieved by increasing the expression level of Fv1. However such a concentration dependent effect is not seen with most Fv1s and cannot explain the recently reported activities against non-MLVs. It will be interesting to examine whether overexpression of other capsid binding restriction factors such as TRIM5alpha or Mx2 result in novel restriction specificities.",,"['Li, Wilson', 'Yap, Melvyn W', 'Voss, Vicky', 'Stoye, Jonathan P']","['Li W', 'Yap MW', 'Voss V', 'Stoye JP']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3377-323X'],"['Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.', 'Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, Mill Hill Laboratory, The Ridgeway, Mill Hill, London, NW7 1AA, UK.

Herein, we aimed to explore the possible mechanisms mediated the resistance to chemotherapy in AML. We found that INPP4B-mediated resistance to genotoxic drug, cytarabine, was accompanied by lower p-H2AX accumulation in KG-1 cells, and INPP4B knockdown evidently sensitized KG-1 cells to cytarabine, meanwhile, p-H2AX expression was increased dramatically. Then, we observed that INPP4B knockdown inhibited the loss of p-H2AX expression after cytarabine removal in INPP4B-silenced KG-1 cells, whereas, in control KG-1 cells, the expression of p-H2AX was reduced in a time-dependent manner. Next, INPP4B knockdown can significantly downregulate ATM expression and subsequently inhibit the activation of ATM downstream targets of p-ATM, p-BRCA1, p-ATR, and p-RAD51. Furthermore, nuclear localization of p65 was inhibited after INPP4B knockdown, and reactivation of p65 can rescue the INPP4B knockdown-induced inhibition of ATM, p-ATM, p-BRCA1, p-ATR, and p-RAD51. Finally, INPP4B expression was positively correlated with ATM expression in AML cells, both INPP4B knockdown and KU55933 can significantly sensitize primary myeloid leukemic cells to cytarabine treatment.Collectively, these data suggest that enhanced ATM-dependent DNA repair is involved in resistance to chemotherapy in INPP4B(high) AML, which could be mediated by p65 nuclear translocation, combination chemotherapy with INPP4B or DNA repair pathway inhibition represents a promising strategy in INPP4B(high) AML.",,"['Wang, Ping', 'Ma, Dan', 'Wang, Jishi', 'Fang, Qin', 'Gao, Rui', 'Wu,

Flow cytometry can be used to monitor MRD in ALL but the implementation of this approach requires extensive expertise. If resources are limited, the costs of full flow cytometric MRD testing might be prohibitive. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the applicability of a previously reported simplified MRD assay, designed to distinguish leukemic from normal lymphoblastic during remission induction therapy. METHODS: Fifty-nine samples from children with ALL, enrolled in the RE-LLA study at a pediatric oncology center in Recife (Brazil), were evaluated for MRD on day 19 and on day 26 of remission induction therapy. We compared results obtained by a trainee in Recife and an expert. RESULTS: The method was implemented successfully and the concordance between results obtained by the trainee and the expert was practically absolute at the end of the study. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to implement reliable measurements of MRD during remission induction therapy in childhood ALL despite limited resources. The simplicity of the MRD method used in this study does not require extensive prior training in leukemia immunophenotyping.

In this study, we analyzed the association between immune cell populations and clinical outcomes in patients receiving Len-dex for the treatment of RRMM. Peripheral blood samples from 90 RRMM patients were taken on day 1 of cycles 1 (baseline), 2, 3, and 4 of Len-dex therapy. Peripheral blood CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) cell frequencies were significantly decreased by 3 cycles of therapy, whereas NK cell frequency was significantly increased after the 3rd cycle. For the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) subset, the frequency of granulocytic MDSCs transiently increased after the 1st cycle, whereas there was an increase in monocytic MDSC (M-MDSC) frequency after the 1st and 3rd cycles. Among 81 evaluable patients, failure to achieve a response of VGPR or greater was associated with a decrease in CD8(+) cell frequency and increase in M-MDSC frequency after 3 cycles of Len-dex treatment. A high proportion of natural killer T (NKT)-like cells (CD3(+)/CD56(+)) prior to Len-dex treatment might predict a longer time to progression. In addition, patients with a smaller decrease in the frequency of both CD3(+) cells and CD8(+) cells by 3 cycles exhibited a longer time to the next treatment.

METHODS: The methylation status of DAPK gene promoter's CpG island was analyzed in the genomes of normal human white blood cells and HL-60, U937 and Jurkat cell lines by bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). The effectiveness of differential methylation patterns of DAPK gene for diagnosis of leukemia was verified in the leukemia cell lines and peripheral blood samples by methylation specific PCR (MSP). RESULTS: The methylation pattern of DAPK gene in different cell genomes displayed that the degree of unmethylation in normal cell genome was higher than that of leukemia cell lines. The differential CpG sites were found and could be used to differentiate HL-60 and the other 3 cell lines by MSP. Meanwhile, the differential methylation patterns in clinical specimens could distinguish acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) and other types of leukemia by MSP. The diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 59.1%, 100% and 82.7% respectively. No relationship was found between MSP diagnosis results and clinical pathological typing.

METHODS: The data of 101 children with T-ALL were collected from April 2005 to November 2012 in Beijing Children's Hospital. The common clinical features, early treatment response, minimal residual disease (MRD), event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were compared between children with SIL-TAL1 positive and negative T-ALL. The treatment efficacy in children with SIL-TAL1 positive T-ALL was compared between BCH-2003 and CCLG-2008 protocol. RESULTS: Out of 101 cases, 22 cases (21.9%) of T-ALL carried SIL-TAL1 fusion gene. The distribution of sex, age, response to prednisone and central nervous system (CNS) involvement were no significant different at diagnosis between SIL-TAL1 positive and negetive patients. However, the WBC count in SIL-TAL1 positive cases were significantly higher than that of SIL-TAL1 negative cases at diagnosis (P<0.05). Additionally, MRD levels were not significantly different between children with SIL-TAL1 positive or negative T-ALL at 3 time points including: after the remission induction therapy, before delayed intensive therapy II and before maintenance therapy. However, the number of cases with high MRD levels before consolidation therapy were more in SIL-TAL1 positive group than that in SIL-TAL1 negative group (P<0.05). The cases with high MRD levels before delayed intensive therapy I was more in SIL-TAL1 negative group than that in the SIL-TAL1 positive group (P>0.05). Besides, there were no significant differences in 5-year EFS and RFS between the two groups. The risk of 22 children with SIL-TAL1 positive acute T-ALL was again stratified according to the typing stemdard in CCLG-2008 protocol, as a result, the risk in BCH-2003 group (10 cases) was significantly higher than that in BCH-2008 group (12 cases) (P<0.05), but no significant difference was found in common clinical features, early treatment response, MRD levels and treatment efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Although WBC level was significantly higher in SIL-TAL1 positive group than that in SIL-TAL1 negative group, the treatment efficacy in SIL-TAL1 positive group was similar to SIL-TAL1 negative group.

METHODS: Real-time PCR assay was used to measure the Rheb mRNA expression in 27 AML patients and 29 ITP patients as control. The relationship between Rheb mRNA expression and age, AML subtype, fusion gene, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and survival of AML patients was analyzed and compared. In addition, HL-60 cell line over-expressing Rheb was established, and the HL-60 cells and HL-60 cells with overexpression of Rheb were treated with Ara-C of different concentrations, the proliferation level was detected by CCK-8 method, and the IC50 was calculated. RESULTS: The mRNA level of Rheb in AML patients was similar to that in ITP patients (control). Interestingly, higher expression of Rheb was associated with better survival and was sensitive to Ara-C treatment. However, the expression level of Rheb was not associated with age, AML subtype, fusion gene, and hepatomegaly of patients. Lower expression level of Rheb was associated with splenomegaly. In vitro analysis of HL-60 line indicated that overexpression of Rheb could increased the cell sensitivity to Ara-C treatment (IC50=0.54 micromol/L) and caused HL-60 cell apoptosis.

METHODS: The clinical data of 24 cases diagnosed as primary AML with trisomy 8 were collected. The clinical characteristics such as sex, age, subtype of FAB, blood routine and bone marrow blast at the first visit were analyzed and the relationship of the characteristics with CR rate and the prognosis was explored. RESULTS: 12 out of 24 AML patients were diagnosed as M5 (50%), while M2, M3, M4 and M6 had 3 cases, respectively (12.5%); one case did not receive the chemotherapy. 23 cases received 1-2 cycles of standard induction chemotherapy. Among them 3 cases of M3 achieved complete response (CR) and survived until the last following up with 100% 5-year OS rate. Among 20 cases of non-M3, 12 cases achieved CR1 (60%), 4 cases achieved partial response (PR) (20%), 4 cases did not respond (NR); 5 cases relapsed in follow-up for 3 years after CR1 (41.7%), 3 cases achieved CR2 after re-induction chemotherapy, and 2 cases remained NR. Among 20 cases of non-M3, 1 case failed to be followed-up after diagnosis within 1 month. The mean follow-up time of 19 cases was 26.2 (1.5-84) months, 9 cases died (6 cases of M5, 1 case of M4 and 2 cases of M2), who achieved PR and NR, or relapsed after CR1; the 3-year DFS and OS were 21%, 31.5% respectively. 2 cases of non-M3 accepted allo-HSCT with HLA-matched sibling donor and kept disease-free survival until the last following up, and survived for 58 and 66 months respectively. Except for 3 cases of M3, 2 cases received allo-HSCT and the cases without chemotherapy, the other 18 cases with initial WBC count less than 10x10(9)/L had OS and DFS longer than those of 10 cases with initial WBC count no less than 10x10(9)/L (P<0.05, P<0.01). The OS of 10 cases with CR1 was longer than OS of those cases without CR1 (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The incidence of trisomy 8 in M5 is higher than the other AML subtypes, and the prognosis of M5 is poor. The initial WBC count above 10x10(9)/L is a high-risk factor. M3 with trisomy 8 and RARA gene has a very good prognosis. Trisomy 8 may increase the risk of primary AML except for M3, so allo-HSCT with HLA-matched sibling donor should be carried out as much as possible after CR1.

The gene WT1 expression level was determined by the ratio of the copy numbers of WT1 to reference gene. And the clinical characteristics, the complete remission (CR) rate after induction chemotherapy, 2-year overall survival (OS) rate and event-free survival (EFS) rate were calculated and analysed. RESULTS: The expression level of WT1 did not significantly correlate with common clinical parameters such as age, sex, molecular abnormality, FAB classification and risk stratification. The CR rate in the high WT1 expression group before treatment was 65.4%, which was lower than that of 93.9% in the low expression group (chi2=8.25, P<0.01). The 2-year overall survival rate and event-free survival rate of the two groups were statistically significantly different (P<0.05), and the OS and EFS rates in high WT1 expression group were lower than those in low expression group.

Idelalisib, a PI3Kdelta-isoform-specific inhibitor, has been approved to treat B-cell malignancies. Although biological activity of the drug has been evaluated, molecular mechanisms and signaling pathway disruption leading to the biological effects of idelalisib are not yet well defined. Prior laboratory reports have identified transcription and translation as the primary events for attenuation of PI3Kalpha isoform. We hypothesized that PI3Kdelta-isoform inhibition by idelalisib should also affect gene transcription and protein translation. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using three mantle cell lymphoma cell lines and primary cells from patients, biological consequences such as apoptosis/cell-cycle analysis, as well as RNA/protein synthesis were evaluated. Proteomics analyses (RPPA and immunoblot assays) defined molecular events downstream of PI3K/AKT cassette. RESULTS: Idelalisib treatment resulted in inhibition of protein synthesis, which correlated with reduction in cell size and cell growth. A moderate loss of viability without any change in cell-cycle profile was observed. Idelalisib treatment inhibited AKT activation, an immediate downstream PI3K effector, and also reduced phosphorylation levels of downstream AKT/mTOR pathway proteins such as PRAS40. In addition, idelalisib treatment impeded activation of the MAPK pathway, and MEK, ERK and p90RSK phosphorylation levels were reduced. Reduction in AKT, PDK1, and MEK phosphorylation correlated with protein synthesis inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these results clarify the molecular mechanisms of actions and may provide biomarkers and targets for combination with idelalisib in B-cell malignancies.

Methods: Sixty-eight survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or brain tumor (BT) were randomly assigned to computerized cognitive intervention (23 ALL/11 BT, age = 12.21 +/- 2.47) or a waitlist control group (24 ALL/10 BT, age = 11.82 +/- 2.42). Cognitive assessments were completed pre-, immediately post-, and 6 months postintervention. Results: A prior report showed training led to immediate improvement in working memory, attention and processing speed. In the current study, piecewise linear mixed effects modeling revealed that working memory and processing speed were unchanged from immediate to 6 months postintervention (intervention beta = -.04 to .01, p = .26 to .95; control beta = -.06 to .01, p = .23-.97), but group differences on an attention measure did not persist. Conclusion: Cognitive benefits are maintained 6 months following computerized cognitive training, adding to potential clinical utility of this intervention approach.","['(c) The Author 2016.

Although they are effective in tumor therapy, treatment with these two drugs may lead to side effects such as arrhythmia and heart failure. At the same clinically equivalent dose, MTX causes slightly reduced cardiotoxicity compared with DOX. These drugs interact with iron to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), target topoisomerase 2 (Top2), and impair mitochondria. These are some of the mechanisms through which these drugs induce late cardiomyopathy. In this review, we compare the cardiotoxicities of these two chemotherapeutic drugs, DOX and MTX. As described here, even though they share similarities in their modes of toxicant action, DOX and MTX seem to differ in a key aspect. DOX is a more redox-interfering drug, while MTX induces energy imbalance. In addition, DOX toxicity can be explained by underlying mechanisms that include targeting of Top2 beta, mitochondrial impairment, and increases in ROS generation. These modes of action have not yet been demonstrated for MTX, and this knowledge gap needs to be filled.",,"['Damiani, Roberto Marques', 'Moura, Dinara Jaqueline', 'Viau, Cassiana Macagnan', 'Caceres, Rafael Andrade', 'Henriques, Joao Antonio Pegas', 'Saffi, Jenifer']","['Damiani RM', 'Moura DJ', 'Viau CM', 'Caceres RA', 'Henriques JAP', 'Saffi J']",,"['Laboratory of Genetic Toxicology, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rua Sarmento Leite, 245, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Genetic Toxicology, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rua Sarmento Leite, 245, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacosciences, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Genetic Toxicology, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rua Sarmento Leite, 245, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Pharmacosciences, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Department of Biophysics, Center of Biotechnology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil.', 'Laboratory of Genetic Toxicology, Federal University of Health Sciences of Porto Alegre (UFCSPA), Rua Sarmento Leite, 245, Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. jenifers@ufcspa.edu.br.', 'Graduate Program in Cellular and Molecular Biology, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil. jenifers@ufcspa.edu.br.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20160625,Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2A protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*toxicity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Heart Diseases/*chemically induced/metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/*toxicity', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors/pharmacology']",,2016/06/28 06:00,2017/03/10 06:00,['2016/06/26 06:00'],"['2016/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2016/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2016/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00204-016-1759-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00204-016-1759-y [pii]']",ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2016 Sep;90(9):2063-2076. doi: 10.1007/s00204-016-1759-y.

The clinical diversity of AML is reflected in the range of recurrent somatic mutations in several genes, many of which have a prognostic and therapeutic value. Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of these genes has the potential for translation into clinical practice. In order to assess this potential, an inter-laboratory evaluation of a commercially available AML gene panel across three diagnostic centres in the UK and Ireland was performed. METHODS: DNA from six AML patient samples was distributed to each centre and processed using a standardised workflow, including a common sequencing platform, sequencing chips and bioinformatics pipeline. A duplicate sample in each centre was run to assess inter- and intra-laboratory performance. RESULTS: An average sample read depth of 2725X (range 629-5600) was achieved using six samples per chip, with some variability observed in the depth of coverage generated for individual samples and between centres. A total of 16 somatic mutations were detected in the six AML samples, with a mean of 2.7 mutations per sample (range 1-4) representing nine genes on the panel. 15/16 mutations were identified by all three centres. Allelic frequencies of the mutations ranged from 5.6 to 53.3 % (median 44.4 %), with a high level of concordance of these frequencies between centres, for mutations detected. CONCLUSION: In this inter-laboratory comparison, a high concordance, reproducibility and robustness was demonstrated using a commercially available NGS AML gene panel and platform.",,"['Haslam, Karl', 'Catherwood, Mark A', 'Dobbin, Edwina', 'Sproul, Anne', 'Langabeer, Stephen E', 'Mills, Ken I']","['Haslam K', 'Catherwood MA', 'Dobbin E', 'Sproul A', 'Langabeer SE', 'Mills KI']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0042-7947'],"[""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, Central Pathology Laboratory, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland. khaslam@stjames.ie."", 'Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queens University, Belfast, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.', 'Almac Diagnostics, Craigavon, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh, UK.', ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, Central Pathology Laboratory, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queens University, Belfast, UK.']",['eng'],,"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)']",IM,"['Alleles', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods/standards', 'Gene Frequency', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic/standards', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2016/06/28 06:00,2017/07/25 06:00,['2016/06/26 06:00'],"['2016/06/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/06/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/07/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s40291-016-0222-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s40291-016-0222-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2016 Oct;20(5):457-61. doi: 10.1007/s40291-016-0222-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experimental data allow us to infer the mechanism of folding upon binding and to pinpoint the key interactions present in the transition state.

Efforts to improve the diagnostic utility of molecular cytogenetic testing have led to the expansion of the traditional 4-probe CLL FISH panel. Not only do these efforts increase the cost of testing, they remain hindered by the inherent limitations of FISH studies - namely the inability to evaluate genomic changes outside of the targeted loci. While array-based profiling and next generation sequencing (NGS) have critically expanded our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of CLL, these methodologies are not routinely used by diagnostic laboratories to evaluate copy number changes or the mutational profile of this disease. Mitogenic stimulation of CLL specimens with CpG-oligonucleotide (CpG-ODN) has been identified as a reliable and reproducible means of obtaining a karyotype, facilitating a low-resolution genome-wide analysis. Across a cohort of 1255 CpG-ODN-stimulated CLL specimens, we describe the clinical utility associated with the combinatorial use of FISH and karyotyping. Our testing algorithm achieves a higher diagnostic yield ( approximately 10%) through the detection of complex karyotypes, well-characterized chromosomal aberrations not covered by the traditional CLL FISH panel and through the detection of concurrent secondary malignancies. Moreover, the single cell nature of this approach permits the evaluation of emerging new clinical concepts including clonal dynamics and clonal evolution. This approach can be broadly applied by diagnostic laboratories to improve the utility of traditional and molecular cytogenetic studies of CLL. Am. J. Hematol. 91:978-983, 2016.

We use the H3K4me3 epigenetic signature to identify microRNA promoters and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing data from the ENCODE project to identify microRNA promoters that are enriched with transcription factor binding sites. By transfecting cells of interest with shRNA targeting a transcription factor of interest and subjecting the cells to microRNA array, we study the effect of this transcription factor on the microRNA transcriptome.
