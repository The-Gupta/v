An imatinib treatment is also incorporated into the model. The simulations of the new PDE model are shown to qualitatively agree with the results that were obtained with the discrete-time (difference equation and agent-based) models.

Our preclinical studies provide evidence that DC that had endocytosed apoptotic CLL cells (Apo-DC) were superior to fusion hybrids, tumor lysate or RNA in eliciting antileukemic T-cell responses in vitro. We have validated a method for enriching the small number of monocyte precursors present in the peripheral blood of CLL patients and utilize them for generating individualized, Apo-DC cellular vaccines.

Treatment of K562 cells with shikonin (e.g., 0.5 muM) resulted in profound induction of apoptosis accompanied by rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), striking activation of c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, marked release of the mitochondrial proteins cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, activation of caspase-9 and -3, and cleavage of PARP. Scavenging of ROS completely blocked all of the above-mentioned events (i.e., JNK and p38 phosphorylation, cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO release, caspase and PARP cleavage, as well as the induction of apoptosis) following shikonin treatment. Inhibition of JNK and knock-down of JNK1 significantly attenuated cytochrome c release, caspase cleavage and apoptosis, but did not affect shikonin-mediated ROS production. Additionally, inhibition of caspase activation completely blocked shikonin-induced apoptosis, but did not appreciably modify shikonin-mediated cytochrome c release or ROS generation. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that shikonin-induced oxidative injury operates at a proximal point in apoptotic signaling cascades, and subsequently activates the stress-related JNK pathway, triggers mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome c release, and caspase activation, and leads to apoptosis. Our data also suggest that shikonin may be a promising agent for the treatment of CML, as a generator of ROS.","['Mao, Xin', 'Yu, Chun Rong', 'Li, Wen Hua', 'Li, Wen Xin']","['Mao X', 'Yu CR', 'Li WH', 'Li WX']","['1State Key Laboratory of Virology, College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cell Res,Cell research,9425763,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Naphthoquinones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3IK6592UBW (shikonin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Naphthoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['cr200886 [pii]', '10.1038/cr.2008.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Res. 2008 Aug;18(8):879-88. doi: 10.1038/cr.2008.86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used the mouse bone marrow transplant model to further explore the role of 24p3 in BCR-ABL-induced leukemia. Consistent with our previous findings, when using non-irradiated mice as recipient, donor marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL but lacking 24p3 did not cause leukemia or any disease after 75 days, whereas all mice receiving wild type BCR-ABL donor cells died with CML-like disease. An agar clone of the BCR-ABL+ human CML cell line K562 (C5) that secretes relatively high levels of lipocalin 2 (human NGAL) induced suppression of hematopoiesis in spleen and marrow of mice, leading to early death in contrast to parental K562 or K562 clone (C6) expressing low amounts of NGAL. Compared with K562 cells, overexpressing NGAL in K562 led to a higher apoptosis rate and an atrophy phenotype in the spleen of the inoculated mice. Plasma from both leukemic mice and CML patients showed elevated lipocalin 2 levels compared with healthy individuals. Moreover, we found that a primary stable cell line from wild-type mouse marrow cells expressing BCR-ABL caused solid tumors in nude mice whereas a similar BCR-ABL+ cell line from 24p3 null mice did not. These findings demonstrate that lipocalin 2 has at least two functions related to tumorigenesis, one involving apoptosis induction of normal hematopoietic cells and the other being tissue invasion by leukemia cells.","['Leng, X', 'Lin, H', 'Ding, T', 'Wang, Y', 'Wu, Y', 'Klumpp, S', 'Sun, T', 'Zhou, Y', 'Monaco, P', 'Belmont, J', 'Aderem, A', 'Akira, S', 'Strong, R', 'Arlinghaus, R']","['Leng X', 'Lin H', 'Ding T', 'Wang Y', 'Wu Y', 'Klumpp S', 'Sun T', 'Zhou Y', 'Monaco P', 'Belmont J', 'Aderem A', 'Akira S', 'Strong R', 'Arlinghaus R']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080728,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (LCN2 protein, human)', '0 (Lipocalin-2)', '0 (Lipocalins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '126469-30-5 (Lcn2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/metabolism', 'Lipocalin-2', 'Lipocalins/analysis/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*physiology', 'Spleen/pathology']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008209 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.209 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Oct 16;27(47):6110-9. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.209.

Preliminary report].,485-91,,"INTRODUCTION: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is common all over the world. Primary EBV infection can lead to latent or chronic infection resulting in lymphoproliferative diseases. THE AIM: of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of laboratory methods used to detect EBV and to monitor EBV infections in children with acute leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we conducted the study on 30 children with acute leukaemia. For the present analysis we included 8 patients from whom samples were also taken three times. Studies were made on serum, blood and bone marrow. Specific IgM and IgG antibodies for viral capsid antigen (VCA), nuclear (EBN) and early antigen (EA) were tested by ELSA. The presence of DNA virus was estimated by nested PCR. The control group were 11 subjects, without chronic or neoplastic disease, undergoing routine laboratory tests in the Virology Department. RESULTS: on admission serologied tests indicated past EBV infection in 6 out of the 8 children. Primary infection was detected in 2 patients, in one of them on day 1 of the observation and on day 22 in the other. DNA EBV was found by nested PCR in only one of the 8 infected children. CONCLUSION: 1. Results of serological investigations indicated the type of EBV infection in our patients. 2. Confirmation of EBV virus active replication by nased PCR was obtained in only 1 out of 8 patients. 3. In order to assess the effectiveness of serological and molecular methods in evaluation of EBV infection type in children with acute leukaemia, it is necessary to investigate a larger group of patients and taken at least three times.","['Pawelec, Katarzyna', 'Trzcinska, Agnieszka', 'Siennicka, Joanna', 'Malinowska, Iwona', 'Litwinska, Bogumila']","['Pawelec K', 'Trzcinska A', 'Siennicka J', 'Malinowska I', 'Litwinska B']","['Katedra i Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii i Onkologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

The most common malignancies comprise nervous system tumours, less frequently soft tissue sarcomas (STS) and leukaemia - myelodysplasia syndrome. Herein we report five cases of STS diagnosed in children affected with NF1 (3 girls and 2 boys, age: 8 months -17 years). Neurogenic tumours were diagnosed in three children (malignant peripheral nerve-sheath tumour in two and malignant triton tumour in one), while soft tissue sarcomas of rhabdomyosarcoma origin were found in two patients. In four cases the primary tumours were highly locally advanced, unresectable and located in pelvis minor. All patients received protocols for soft STS: CWS-91, 96 and 2002. The paper presents the clinical symptomatology, the course and outcome in children with NF1 affected with STS. CONCLUSION: basing on our own observations STS in NF1 seems to have poor prognosis in spite of combined therapy. Since early diagnosis is essential, children with NF1 should remain under the care of the oncologist.","['Bien, Ewa', 'Stachowicz-Stencel, Teresa', 'Polczynska, Katarzyna', 'Sierota, Danuta', 'Stefanowicz, Joanna', 'Szolkiewicz, Anna', 'Drozynska, Elzbieta', 'Birkholtz, Dorota', 'Izycka-Swieszewska, Ewa', 'Czauderna, Piotr', 'Kosiak, Wojciech', 'Dubaniewicz, Miroslawa', 'Reiter, Marta', 'Balcerska, Anna']","['Bien E', 'Stachowicz-Stencel T', 'Polczynska K', 'Sierota D', 'Stefanowicz J', 'Szolkiewicz A', 'Drozynska E', 'Birkholtz D', 'Izycka-Swieszewska E', 'Czauderna P', 'Kosiak W', 'Dubaniewicz M', 'Reiter M', 'Balcerska A']","['Klinika Pediatrii, Hematologii, Onkologii i Endokrynologii, Akademia Medyczna, ul.

Clonal copy number differences were detected in cells from 36 of 44 patients. In contrast, cells from only 16 of the 44 patients displayed karyotypic abnormalities.

Regulated by 2 promoters P1 and P2, RUNX3 is frequently inactivated by P2 methylation in solid tumors. Growing evidence has suggested a role of this transcription factor in hematopoiesis. However, genetic alterations have not been reported in blood cancers. In this study on 73 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (44 children and 29 adults), we first showed that high RUNX3 expression among childhood AML was associated with a shortened event-free survival, and RUNX3 was significantly underexpressed in the prognostically favorable subgroup of AML with the t(8;21) and inv(16) translocations. We further demonstrated that this RUNX3 repression was mediated not by P2 methylation, but RUNX1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11, the fusion products of t(8;21) and inv(16), via a novel transcriptional mechanism that acts directly or indirectly in collaboration with RUNX1, on 2 conserved RUNX binding sites in the P1 promoter. In in vitro studies, ectopically expressed RUNX1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 also inhibited endogenous RUNX3 expression. Taken together, RUNX3 was the first transcriptional target found to be commonly repressed by the t(8;21) and inv(16) fusion proteins and might have an important role in core-binding factor AML.","['Cheng, Chi Keung', 'Li, Libby', 'Cheng, Suk Hang', 'Lau, Kin Mang', 'Chan, Natalie P H', 'Wong, Raymond S M', 'Shing, Matthew M K', 'Li, Chi Kong', 'Ng, Margaret H L']","['Cheng CK', 'Li L', 'Cheng SH', 'Lau KM', 'Chan NP', 'Wong RS', 'Shing MM', 'Li CK', 'Ng MH']","['Department of Anatomical and Cellular Pathology, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080728,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit)', '0 (Runx3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 3 Subunit/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59748-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-02-137083 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 15;112(8):3391-402. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-137083.

Transplantation of whole bone marrow cells that express oncogenic K-Ras into wild-type recipient mice resulted in a highly penetrant, aggressive T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. The lymphoblasts were composed of a CD4/CD8 double-positive population that aberrantly expressed CD44. Thymi of primary donor mice showed reduced cellularity, and immunophenotypic analysis demonstrated a block in differentiation at the double-negative 1 stage. With progression of disease, approximately 50% of mice acquired Notch1 mutations within the PEST domain. Of note, primary lymphoblasts were hypersensitive to gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, which is known to impair Notch signaling. This inhibition was Notch-specific as assessed by down-regulation of Notch1 target genes and intracellular cleaved Notch. We also observed that the oncogenic K-Ras-induced T-cell disease was responsive to rapamycin and inhibitors of the RAS/MAPK pathway. These data indicate that patients with T-cell leukemia with K-Ras mutations may benefit from therapies that target the NOTCH pathway alone or in combination with inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/MTOR and RAS/MAPK pathways.","['Kindler, Thomas', 'Cornejo, Melanie G', 'Scholl, Claudia', 'Liu, Jianing', 'Leeman, Dena S', 'Haydu, J Erika', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Kindler T', 'Cornejo MG', 'Scholl C', 'Liu J', 'Leeman DS', 'Haydu JE', 'Frohling S', 'Lee BH', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Brigham & Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA. thomas.kindler@ukmainz.de .""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080728,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics', 'ras Proteins/*physiology']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59746-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-147587 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 15;112(8):3373-82. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-147587.

A specialized medium and several growth factors were tested to study the in vitro behavior of bovine type A spermatogonia, a cell population that includes the SSCs and can be specifically stained for the lectin Dolichos biflorus agglutinin. During short-term culture (2 weeks), colonies appeared, the morphology of which varied with the specific growth factor(s) added. Whenever the stem cell medium was used, round structures reminiscent of sectioned seminiferous tubules appeared in the core of the colonies. Remarkably, these round structures always contained type A spermatogonia. When leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), or fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) were added, specific effects on the numbers and arrangement of somatic cells were observed. However, the number of type A spermatogonia was significantly higher in cultures to which glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) was added and highest when GDNF, LIF, EGF, and FGF2 were all present. The latter suggests that a proper stimulation of the somatic cells is necessary for optimal stimulation of the germ cells in culture. Somatic cells present in the colonies included Sertoli cells, peritubular myoid cells, and a few Leydig cells. A transplantation experiment, using nude mice, showed the presence of SSCs among the cultured cells and in addition strongly suggested a more than 10 000-fold increase in the number of SSCs after 30 days of culture. These results demonstrate that bovine SSC self-renew in our specialized bovine culture system and that this system can be used for the propagation of these cells.","['Aponte, Pedro M', 'Soda, Takeshi', 'Teerds, Katja J', 'Mizrak, S Canan', 'van de Kant, Henk J G', 'de Rooij, Dirk G']","['Aponte PM', 'Soda T', 'Teerds KJ', 'Mizrak SC', 'van de Kant HJ', 'de Rooij DG']","['Endocrinology and Metabolism, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands. apontep@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080728,England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cattle', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Sperm Count', 'Spermatogonia/*cytology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Time', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['REP-07-0419 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-07-0419 [doi]']",ppublish,Reproduction. 2008 Nov;136(5):543-57. doi: 10.1530/REP-07-0419.

The progressively emerging picture leads us to consider that the critical genes for malignant CLL cells are those regulated by a number of microRNAs revealed by refined cytogenetic and molecular studies, and that the key molecule is the B-cell receptor (BCR). The hypothesis that CLL cells might be selected by some sort of antigenic pressure is strengthened by numerous findings indicating that a BCR-mediated stimulation plays a relevant role in the natural history of the disease and that autoantigens, as well as molecular structures instrumental in eliminating and scavenging apoptotic cells and pathogenic bacteria, may be relevant in triggering and/or facilitating the evolution of CLL. An important question is whether the tiny monoclonal B-cell populations phenotypically similar to CLL (that occur in the peripheral blood of about 3.5% of healthy individuals and are termed monoclonal B lymphocytosis) might be a critical step in the development of CLL. All relevant events of CLL occur in tissues in which a number of cellular and molecular interactions shape a microenvironment conducive to the accumulation of malignant cells and favor the organization of proliferating cells in focal aggregates of variable size that form the pseudofollicular proliferation centers. Given the impact that understanding the pathogenesis of CLL might have on the development of new treatments, the purposes of this review are to discuss whether the novel insights in CLL are leading us closer to understanding the tenet of the disease; to define the emerging new, stimulating questions; and to unfold the major challenges that still need to be addressed.","['Caligaris-Cappio, Federico', 'Ghia, Paolo']","['Caligaris-Cappio F', 'Ghia P']","['Department of Oncology, Unit and Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele, Milano, Italy. caligaris.federico@hsr.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080728,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Precancerous Conditions/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*genetics']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.4393 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4393 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 20;26(27):4497-503. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4393.

METHODS: Clinical data and blood samples were collected from 19 ALL paediatric patients and 35 IBD patients who were receiving 6-MP/AZA therapy. All patients were screened for seven genetic polymorphisms in three enzymes involved in mercaptopurine metabolism [xanthine oxidase, inosine triphosphatase (C94-->A and IVS2+21A-->C) and thiopurine methyltransferase]. Erythrocyte and plasma metabolite concentrations were also determined. The associations between the various genotypes and myelotoxicity, haematological parameters and metabolite concentrations were determined. RESULTS: Thiopurine methyltransferase variant alleles were associated with a preferential metabolism away from 6-methylmercaptopurine nucleotides (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.038 in IBD patients) favouring 6-thioguanine nucleotides (6-TGNs) (P = 0.021 in ALL patients). Interestingly, carriers of inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants among ALL and IBD patients had significantly higher concentrations of the active cytotoxic metabolites, 6-TGNs (P = 0.008 in ALL patients, P = 0.047 in IBD patients). The study confirmed the association of thiopurine methyltransferase heterozygosity with leucopenia and neutropenia in ALL patients and reported a significant association between inosine triphosphatase IVS2+21A-->C variants with thrombocytopenia (P = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS; Pharmacogenetic polymorphisms in the 6-MP pathway may help identify patients at risk for associated toxicities and may serve as a guide for dose individualization.","['Hawwa, Ahmed F', 'Millership, Jeff S', 'Collier, Paul S', 'Vandenbroeck, Koen', 'McCarthy, Anthony', 'Dempsey, Sid', 'Cairns, Carole', 'Collins, John', 'Rodgers, Colin', 'McElnay, James C']","['Hawwa AF', 'Millership JS', 'Collier PS', 'Vandenbroeck K', 'McCarthy A', 'Dempsey S', 'Cairns C', 'Collins J', 'Rodgers C', 'McElnay JC']","[""Clinical and Practice Research Group, School of Pharmacy, Medical Biology Centre, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080628,England,Br J Clin Pharmacol,British journal of clinical pharmacology,7503323,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '15867-02-4 (6-thioguanylic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Guanine Nucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Methyltransferases/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Pharmacogenetics/methods', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']","['BCP3248 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03248.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Clin Pharmacol. 2008 Oct;66(4):517-28. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2125.2008.03248.x.

METHODS: A child with CML in lymphoid blast crisis was diagnosed by complete hematological and bone marrow examination. There was no central nervous system (CNS) leukemia at presentation. The child was treated with IM at a daily dose of 400 mg. RESULTS: The child showed remission after IM administration for 28 days and remained in remission till 59 days. On day 59 she experienced headache and vomiting. Results of cerebrospinal fluid taken for cytopathology showed CNS leukemia. MCP 841 protocol for ALL and weekly intrathecal triple therapy (ITT) was given. CONCLUSIONS: Along with IM treatment in patients with CML in blast crisis, weekly ITT with hydrocortisone, cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate should be recommended to prevent CNS involvement.","['Thavaraj, Vasantha', 'Seth, Rachna']","['Thavaraj V', 'Seth R']","['Pediatric Oncology Division, Department of Pediatrics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi 110029, India. sowmyam.vasantha@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Switzerland,World J Pediatr,World journal of pediatrics : WJP,101278599,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/diagnosis/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Chemoprevention/methods', 'Child', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction']",2008/07/30 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/30 09:00'],"['2008/07/30 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/30 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12519-008-0029-3 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Pediatr. 2008 May;4(2):145-7. doi: 10.1007/s12519-008-0029-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, L-asparaginase can cause a fatal complication of pancreatitis, and an effective treatment for L-asparaginase-associated pancreatitis (AAP) has not been developed to date. The authors investigated whether rapidly treating children with AAP by continuous regional arterial infusion (CRAI) of protease inhibitor and antibiotic would quickly resolve AAP. METHODS: Between 2000 and 2007, 104 pediatric patients with ALL or LBL were treated at the authors' affiliated hospitals with intensive regimens that included Escherichia coli-derived L-asparaginase. Six of 104 patients developed severe AAP. One patient was treated with intravenous infusion of protease inhibitor, and the remaining 5 patients received CRAI of protease inhibitor and antibiotic within 48 hours of the onset of AAP. RESULTS: The patient who received intravenous protease inhibitor had pseudocyst formation and developed a subsequent leukemic recurrence after the interruption of chemotherapy for 4.5 months. In the other patients, AAP subsided within 2 to 6 days after the start of CRAI, and serious complications did not emerge. Significantly, chemotherapy could be resumed within 4 weeks (range, 12-23 days) after the onset of AAP, and the patients were in complete remission from 4 months to 44 months with further chemotherapy that excluded L-asparaginase. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that early introduction of CRAI of protease inhibitor and antibiotic is suitable for treating severe AAP.","['Morimoto, Akira', 'Imamura, Toshihiko', 'Ishii, Rumiko', 'Nakabayashi, Yoshinobu', 'Nakatani, Takuya', 'Sakagami, Junichi', 'Yamagami, Takuji']","['Morimoto A', 'Imamura T', 'Ishii R', 'Nakabayashi Y', 'Nakatani T', 'Sakagami J', 'Yamagami T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan. akira@koto.kpu-m.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Infusions, Intra-Arterial', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Pancreatic Pseudocyst/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Protease Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.23716 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2008 Sep 15;113(6):1362-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.23716.,,,,,,,['(c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,

Further, a post-SCT infection may influence the milieu of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We performed a retrospective study of patients with acute leukemia who had undergone allogeneic SCT using the same preparative regimens and bone marrow as the stem cell source to determine if early post-transplant infection was associated with the risk of leukemic relapse and GVHD. The analysis revealed that patients who had a febrile infection (FI) before post-transplant day 21 (FI group) had a lower actuarial probability of leukemic relapse (P < 0.001) and a higher relapse-free survival rate (P = 0.012) than those patients who did not have a FI before post-transplant day 21 (non-FI group). The experience of early post-transplant FI (HR = 0.316; 95% CI = 0.174-0.575; P < 0.001), together with the presence of chronic GVHD and high risk cytogenetics, were independent predictive factors for post-transplant leukemic relapse. The FI group had a trend towards a higher lymphocyte count on post-transplant day 21 than the non-FI group (P = 0.063), despite the delayed recovery of the platelet count and a trend towards delayed recovery of the neutrophil count. These findings suggest that a change in the immunologic network by infectious diseases in the early post-transplant period favors the milieu of the GVL effect. The specific immunologic change during FI, which can potentiate the GVL effect, remains to be determined.","['Kim, Sung-Yong', 'Lee, Dong-Gun', 'Kim, Myung-Shin', 'Kim, Hee-Je', 'Lee, Seok', 'Min, Chang-Ki']","['Kim SY', 'Lee DG', 'Kim MS', 'Kim HJ', 'Lee S', 'Min CK']","['Division of Hematology, Catholic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/*prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Humans', 'Infections/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/immunology']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/16 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21227 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Oct;83(10):784-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21227.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Impaired apoptosis causes dysfunction of lymphocyte homeostasis, growth advantage of tumor cells as well as resistance to current treatment protocols. To investigate the role of the apoptosis adaptor molecules TRADD and FADD in the development of hematological diseases, patient samples were screened for mutations in these genes. PROCEDURE: Genomic DNA from 51 children suffering from B-lineage-ALL (n = 17), T-lineage-ALL (n = 24), ALPS Type Ia (n = 3) and ALPS Type III (n = 7) were analyzed. Genomic DNA from 50 unrelated donors without hematological diseases served as controls. Identified mutations were cloned and their influence on cell viability and NFkappaB activation was analyzed by flow cytometry and luciferase assay, respectively. RESULTS: In the FADD gene no genetic alteration could be detected. However, three novel missense mutations in the TRADD gene could be detected. They are located within a region of TRADD known to exert mainly anti-apoptotic effects for example through the activation of the NFkappaB pathway. Functional analysis of cells overexpressing mutant TRADD cDNA demonstrated a reduced NFkappaB activity and consequently increased cell death compared to wild-type TRADD. CONCLUSION: Mutations in the TRADD gene may contribute to the development of different hematological diseases. The identified mutations demonstrate a putative impact on TRADD signaling and cell survival but may not mainly explain the pathology of the diseases investigated.","['Dechant, M J', 'Scheuerpflug, C G', 'Pauly, E', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch, J', 'Debatin, K M', 'Fellenberg, J']","['Dechant MJ', 'Scheuerpflug CG', 'Pauly E', 'van der Werff Ten Bosch J', 'Debatin KM', 'Fellenberg J']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Orthopedic University Hospital, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Death/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation, Missense', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21672 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Nov;51(5):616-20. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21672.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analysis of current research into magnetic nanoparticles. Physics estimates and the development of the hypothesis that intracellular magnetic nanoparticles chronically change the free radical concentration and can mediate the enhanced rate of DNA damage in hematopoietic stem cells. RESULTS: The properties of magnetic nanoparticles are considered and the naturally occurring magnetic field generated by a magnetic nanoparticle within a cell is calculated to be in the range of about 1-200 millitesla, which exceeds the level of the natural geomagnetic field by orders of magnitude. Experiments are summarized on the biological effects of static magnetic field in this range. It is shown that magnetic nanoparticles can increase the rate of free radical formation by a few percent, in the course of an idealized radical-pair reaction in a cell. A mechanism is discussed that explains how weak alternating magnetic fields, of the order of 0.4 muT, could cause an increase in the rate of leukaemia via millitesla fields produced around superparamagnetic nanoparticles in hematopoietic stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: The postulated presence of magnetic nanoparticles located in hematopoietic stem cells could constitute a cancer risk factor. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles can possibly mediate increased level of leukaemia caused by background exposure to low-frequency weak EMF.","['Binhi, Vladimir']",['Binhi V'],"['General Physics Institute, the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. binhi@kapella.gpi.ru']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,['0 (Free Radicals)'],IM,"['Child', 'DNA Damage/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Free Radicals/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Magnetics/*adverse effects', 'Nanoparticles/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['795327691 [pii]', '10.1080/09553000802195323 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2008 Jul;84(7):569-79. doi: 10.1080/09553000802195323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HTLV-1 Tax1 transforming protein interacts with several PDZ domain-containing proteins, and the interaction is associated with the transforming activities of Tax1 as well as persistent HTLV-1 infection. In this study, we show that Tax1 interacts with the tumor suppressor Scribble containing PDZ domains. Unlike other Tax1-interacting PDZ domain proteins, the PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) of Tax1 was not required for the interaction with transiently expressed Scribble in 293T cells, but it was essential for the interaction with endogenous Scribble. Endogenous Scribble in 293T cells was primarily localized at the plasma membrane and colocalized with Tax1 but not Tax1C lacking PBM, whereas transiently expressed Scribble was localized in the cytoplasm and colocalized with Tax1C as well as Tax1, thus suggesting that Tax1 is recruited to the site of endogenous Scribble, such as the plasma membrane, in a PBM-dependent manner, and thereafter it interacts with Scribble in a PBM-independent and PBM-dependent manner. Endogenous Scribble was diffusely localized at the plasma membrane of HTLV-1-uninfected T-cell lines, whereas it colocalized with Tax1 as small and large aggregate at the plasma membranes. These results suggest that Tax1 through two binding sites induce aberrant clustering of Scribble, thereby altering the functions in HTLV-1-infected cells, which may thus play a role in persistent HTLV-1 infection and the pathogenesis.","['Okajima, Masaaki', 'Takahashi, Masahiko', 'Higuchi, Masaya', 'Ohsawa, Toshiaki', 'Yoshida, Sakiko', 'Yoshida, Yutaka', 'Oie, Masayasu', 'Tanaka, Yuetsu', 'Gejyo, Fumitake', 'Fujii, Masahiro']","['Okajima M', 'Takahashi M', 'Higuchi M', 'Ohsawa T', 'Yoshida S', 'Yoshida Y', 'Oie M', 'Tanaka Y', 'Gejyo F', 'Fujii M']","['Division of Virology, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, 1-757 Asahimachi-Dori, Niigata, 951-8510, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080726,United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (SCRIB protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*metabolism/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'PDZ Domains', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11262-008-0259-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Virus Genes. 2008 Oct;37(2):231-40. doi: 10.1007/s11262-008-0259-4.

Here we describe HA-HDI-resistant human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) HL-60 (HL-60/LR) cells that are resistant to LAQ824, vorinostat, LBH589, and sodium butyrate. HL-60/LR cells show increased expression of HDACs 1, 2, and 4 but lack HDAC6 expression, with concomitant hyperacetylation of heat shock protein 90 (hsp90). Treatment with HA-HDI failed to further augment hsp90 acetylation, or increase the levels of p21 or reactive oxygen species (ROSs), in HL-60/LR versus HL-60 cells. Although cross-resistant to antileukemia agents (eg, cytarabine, etoposide, and TRAIL), HL-60/LR cells are collaterally sensitive to the hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG. Treatment with 17-AAG did not induce hsp70 or deplete the hsp90 client proteins AKT and c-Raf. HL-60/LR versus HL-60 cells display a higher growth fraction and shorter doubling time, along with a shorter interval to generation of leukemia and survival in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Thus, resistance of AML cells to HA-HDIs is associated with loss of HDAC6, hyperacetylation of hsp90, aggressive leukemia phenotype, and collateral sensitivity to 17-AAG. These findings suggest that an hsp90 inhibitor-based antileukemia therapy may override de novo or acquired resistance of AML cells to HA-HDIs.","['Fiskus, Warren', 'Rao, Rekha', 'Fernandez, Pravina', 'Herger, Bryan', 'Yang, Yonghua', 'Chen, Jianguang', 'Kolhe, Ravindra', 'Mandawat, Aditya', 'Wang, Yongchao', 'Joshi, Rajeshree', 'Eaton, Kelly', 'Lee, Pearl', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Peiper, Stephen', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Fiskus W', 'Rao R', 'Fernandez P', 'Herger B', 'Yang Y', 'Chen J', 'Kolhe R', 'Mandawat A', 'Wang Y', 'Joshi R', 'Eaton K', 'Lee P', 'Atadja P', 'Peiper S', 'Bhalla K']","['MCG Cancer Center, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080725,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (LAQ824)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tubulin)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', '9647FM7Y3Z (Panobinostat)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Indoles', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Panobinostat', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Vorinostat']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59816-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-10-116319 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 1;112(7):2896-905. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-10-116319.

While Kit inhibitors have activity in the clinical setting, they possess variable efficacy against particular forms of mutant Kit and drug resistance often develops over time. Inhibitors of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a chaperone for which Kit is a client protein, have demonstrated activity against human cancers and evidence suggests they downregulate several mutated and imatinib-resistant forms of Kit. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a novel HSP90 inhibitor, STA-9090, against wild-type (WT) and mutant Kit in canine bone marrow-derived cultured mast cells (BMCMCs), malignant mast cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant mast cells were treated with STA-9090, 17-AAG, and SU11654 and evaluated for loss in cell viability, cell death, alterations in HSP90 and Kit expression/signaling, and Kit mutation. STA-9090 activity was tested in a canine mastocytoma xenograft model. RESULTS: Treatment of BMCMCs, cell lines, and fresh malignant cells with STA-9090 induced growth inhibition, apoptosis that was caspase-3/7-dependent, and downregulation of phospho/total Kit and Akt, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Loss of Kit cell-surface expression was also observed. Furthermore, STA-9090 exhibited superior activity to 17-AAG and SU11654, and was effective against malignant mast cells expressing either WT or mutant Kit. Lastly, STA-9090 inhibited tumor growth in a canine mastocytoma mouse xenograft model. CONCLUSIONS: STA-9090 exhibits broad activity against mast cells expressing WT or mutant Kit, suggesting it may be an effective agent in the clinical setting against mast cell malignancies.","['Lin, Tzu-Yin', 'Bear, Misty', 'Du, Zhenjian', 'Foley, Kevin P', 'Ying, Weiwen', 'Barsoum, James', 'London, Cheryl']","['Lin TY', 'Bear M', 'Du Z', 'Foley KP', 'Ying W', 'Barsoum J', 'London C']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080726,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (STA 9090)', '0 (Triazoles)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Dog Diseases/pathology', 'Dogs', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Mast-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mastocytoma/pathology/veterinary', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/*genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2007/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00222-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1266-77. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.001.

However, there are conflicting results on its growth inhibitory effect on normal cells. This project examined the differential effect of resveratrol at physiologically relevant concentrations on nonmalignant (WIL2-NS) and malignant (HL-60) cell lines and compared the underlying mechanisms via cell cycle modulation, apoptosis induction, and genotoxicity potential. Twenty-four hours of exposure to resveratrol was toxic to WIL2-NS and HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. WIL2-NS cells regrew 5 times more than HL-60 cells by 120 h after the removal of 100 microM resveratrol (p < 0.05). Furthermore, significant alterations in cell cycle kinetics were induced by resveratrol in HL-60 cells, but were to a lesser extent for WIL2-NS cells. The proportion of apoptosis was also 3 times higher in HL-60 cells as compared to WIL2-NS cells for 100 microM resveratrol (p < 0.05). In conclusion, resveratrol preferentially inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells via cell cycle modulation and apoptosis induction and subsequently directed the cells to irreversible cell death, whereas the effect on WIL2-NS cells was largely reversible.","['Lee, Sau K', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Sanderson, Barbara J S']","['Lee SK', 'Zhang W', 'Sanderson BJ']","['Department of Medical Biotechnology, School of Medicine, Flinders University, GPO Box 2100, Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080726,United States,J Agric Food Chem,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,0374755,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Stilbenes)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Resveratrol', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology/toxicity']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jf801014p [doi]'],ppublish,J Agric Food Chem. 2008 Aug 27;56(16):7572-7. doi: 10.1021/jf801014p.

Subsequent histopathology disclosed sheets of mononuclear cells in the orbital mass, and immunohistochemical stains demonstrated positive results for myeloperoxidase and CD43, which supported the diagnosis of granulocytic sarcoma (GS). After his 1-year follow-up, the patient presented with pancytopenia, and an ensuing bone marrow aspiration revealed markedly hypercellular marrow replaced by many large abnormal myeloblasts.

To find out if there were possibly additional subtle chromosomal changes undetectable by routine cytogenetics, high-density 385K oligo array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) assay was performed. Besides the confirmation of the 12p deletion, a deletion of a 12-megabase (Mb) chromosomal segment on 14q24.1 approximately q24.3 was also detected. Within the deleted 12-Mb region, there were a total of 155 genes and at least 28 of these were cancer-related genes.

METHODS: In Yorkshire swine, the infrarenal aorta was balloon dilated and infused with a solution of type I collagenase/pancreatic porcine elastase (16,000 U/1,000 U). Aneurysmal and control aortic samples were obtained at 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 6), and 4 (n = 5) weeks following aneurysm induction. RNA was isolated, converted to biotin-modified antisense RNA and hybridized to porcine genome arrays. Aneurysmal and control gene intensities were compared using the 2-sample-for-means z-test. P < .01 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Extracellular matrix remodeling genes that were upregulated in aneurysmal compared with control tissue included matrix metalloproteinase-1, -2, -3, and -9; MT-MMP; cathepsin-D, -H, -K, and -S; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1; and collagen I-alpha1 chain (P < .01). Elastin exhibited temporally downregulated gene expression (P < .01). Inflammatory genes that were upregulated included intercellular adhesion molecule-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-10, chemokine receptor-4, and tissue plasminogen activator (P < .01). Atherosclerosis and cancer genes that were upregulated included apolipoprotein E, acyl-CoA binding protein, friend leukemia virus integration-1, and E26 transformation-specific sequence (P < .01). CONCLUSION: The porcine model replicates the gene expression patterns that are observed during the development of aneurysms in human studies as well as in rodent models. The porcine model thereby represents a novel method to study the impact of endovascular, cell-based, and other therapeutic interventions on AAA pathophysiology.","['Sadek, Mikel', 'Hynecek, Robert L', 'Goldenberg, Sagit', 'Kent, K Craig', 'Marin, Michael L', 'Faries, Peter L']","['Sadek M', 'Hynecek RL', 'Goldenberg S', 'Kent KC', 'Marin ML', 'Faries PL']","['Department of Surgery, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Surgery,Surgery,0417347,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal/*genetics', 'Atherosclerosis/genetics', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Extracellular Matrix/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Sus scrofa']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0039-6060(08)00256-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.surg.2008.04.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Surgery. 2008 Aug;144(2):252-8. doi: 10.1016/j.surg.2008.04.007.,,"['K08 HL073313/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL073313-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08HL073313/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2580720,['NIHMS63918'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we identify a multi-C(2)H(2)-type zinc finger protein (ZNF), ZNF451, as a novel nuclear protein that can be associated with promyelocytic leukemia bodies. In keeping with its interaction with SUMO E2 conjugase Ubc9 and SUMOs, ZNF451 is covalently modified by SUMOs (sumoylated) at several, albeit nonconsensus, sites. Interestingly, noncovalent SUMO-binding activity of ZNF451 (SUMO-interacting motif) is also important for its sumoylation. SUMO modifications regulate the nuclear compartmentalization of ZNF451, since coexpression of ZNF451 with SUMO-specific proteases SENP1 or SENP2, both capable of desumoylating the protein, redistributes ZNF451 from nuclear domains to speckles and nucleoplasm. Interaction of ZNF451 with PIAS1 (protein inhibitor of activated STAT 1) is not manifested as PIAS1's E3 SUMO ligase activity towards ZNF451 but results in disintegration of ZNF451 nuclear domains and recruitment of ZNF451 to androgen receptor (AR) speckles. ZNF451 interacts weakly, but in a SUMO-1-enhanced fashion, with AR. ZNF451 does not harbor an intrinsic transcription activation function, but interestingly, ablation of endogenous ZNF451 in prostate cancer cells significantly decreases expression of several AR target genes. Thus, we suggest that ZNF451 exerts its effects via SUMO modification machinery and trafficking of transcription regulators between promyelocytic leukemia bodies and nucleoplasm.","['Karvonen, Ulla', 'Jaaskelainen, Tiina', 'Rytinki, Miia', 'Kaikkonen, Sanna', 'Palvimo, Jorma J']","['Karvonen U', 'Jaaskelainen T', 'Rytinki M', 'Kaikkonen S', 'Palvimo JJ']","['Biomedicum Helsinki, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Helsinki, P.O.

It has been reported that flavonoids isolated from several Citrus have been shown to suppress the degranulation as inferred by histamine release in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. In this study, we examined the effect of PMFs (PMF-1: 6,7,4',5'-tetramethoxy-5-monohydroxyflavone, PMF-2: 5,6,8,3',6'-pentamethoxy flavone, PMF-3: 5,6,7,3',4',5'-hexamethoxy flavone) on the degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells. All the PMFs suppressed the degranulation from Ag-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Interestingly, PMF-combination (PMF-1+PMF-2; PMF-1+PMF-3) treatment enhanced the inhibition of degranulation compared with PMF-single treatment. In order to clarify the inhibitory mechanism of degranulation by PMFs, we examined the activation of intracellular signaling molecules such as Lyn, Syk, and PLCgammas. All the PMFs significantly suppressed the activation of Syk and PLCgammas. In Ag-mediated activation of Fc epsilonRI on mast cells, three major subfamilies of mitogen-activated protein kinases, especially ERK44/42, were activated. These PMFs reduced the level of phospho-ERKs. The intracellular free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) was elevated by Fc epsilonRI activation, and PMF treatment reduced the elevation of [Ca(2+)]i by suppressing Ca(2+) influx. Thus, it was suggested that the suppression of Ag-stimulated degranulation by these PMFs mainly is due to the Syk/PLCgammas/PKC pathway and Ca(2+) influx. Furthermore, to be noted in the PMF-combination treatment, inactivation of Syk was enhanced compared with PMF-single treatment. But the inhibitory effect of degranulation by PMF-combination treatment was not associated with the suppression of Ca(2+) influx.","['Itoh, Tomohiro', 'Ohguchi, Kenji', 'Iinuma, Munekazu', 'Nozawa, Yoshinori', 'Akao, Yukihiro']","['Itoh T', 'Ohguchi K', 'Iinuma M', 'Nozawa Y', 'Akao Y']","['Gifu International Institute of Biotechnology, 1-1 Naka-Fudogaoka, Kakamigahara, Gifu 504-0838, Japan. titoh@giib.or.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080712,England,Bioorg Med Chem,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,9413298,"['0 (Flavones)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Basophils/*drug effects/physiology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Citrus/*chemistry', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flavones/*pharmacology', 'Histamine Release/drug effects', 'Immunoblotting', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Phospholipase C gamma/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Receptors, IgG/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Syk Kinase', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0968-0896(08)00621-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bmc.2008.07.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Med Chem. 2008 Aug 15;16(16):7592-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.07.018.

Wrapper methods operate in a recursive fashion where feature (gene) weights are re-evaluated and dynamically changing from iteration to iteration, while in filter methods feature weights remain fixed. Our objective in this study is to show that the application of filter criteria in a recursive fashion, where weights are potentially adjusted from cycle to cycle, produces noticeable improvement on the generalization performance measured on independent test sets. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Toward this direction we explore the behavior of two well known and broadly accepted pattern recognition approaches namely the support vector machines (SVM) and a single linear neuron (LN), properly adapted to the problem of marker selection. Within this context we also show how the kernel ability of SVM could be employed in a practical manner to provide alternative ways to approach the problem of reliable marker selection. RESULTS: We explore how the proposed approaches behave in two application domains (breast cancer and leukemia), achieving comparable or even better results than those reported in the related bibliography. An important advantage of these approaches is their ability to derive stable performance without deteriorating due to the complexity of the application domain. Validation is performed using internal leave one out (ILOO) and 10-fold cross validation as well as independent test set evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: Results show that the proposed methodologies achieve remarkable performance and indicate that applying filter criteria in a wrapper fashion ('wrapper filtering criteria') provides a useful tool for marker selection. The contribution of this study is threefold. First it provides a methodology to apply filter criteria in a wrapper way (which is a new approach), second it introduces a fundamental pattern recognition component namely the single neuron (which is a linear estimator) and explores its behavior on marker selection and third it demonstrates an approach to exploit the kernel ability of SVMs in a practical and effective manner.","['Blazadonakis, Michalis E', 'Zervakis, Michalis']","['Blazadonakis ME', 'Zervakis M']","['Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, Technical University of Crete, University Campus, Chania Crete 73100, Greece. mblazad@ier.forthnet.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080724,United States,Comput Biol Med,Computers in biology and medicine,1250250,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Gene Expression', '*Neurons', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis']",2008/07/29 09:00,2008/12/30 09:00,['2008/07/29 09:00'],"['2007/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0010-4825(08)00086-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.compbiomed.2008.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Comput Biol Med. 2008 Aug;38(8):894-912. doi: 10.1016/j.compbiomed.2008.05.005.

METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients with malignancy, having neurological symptoms, admitted to The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan. RESULTS: There were a total of 178 admissions among 152 patients, with more than half (50.5%) of them above the age of 50, with a male to female ratio of 1.34:1. Most admissions (60%) occurred within the first year of diagnosis of the malignancy. Neurological problems were the second commonest cause for admission (20%) in our study group following admissions for chemotherapy/transfusions (52%). The most common primary tumour was Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (16.3%), followed by breast (15.7%), Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), (12.9%) and carcinoma of unknown primary site (9%). The 3 most common symptoms were altered mental status (45.3%), lower-limb weakness (27.9%) and seizures (17.3%). Fifteen percent of admissions were secondary to a neurological symptom as an initial presentation of the primary tumour. The commonest neurological diagnoses were brain metastasis (27%), followed by spinal cord compression (16.9%), intracerebral haemorrhage (11.2%) and metabolic encephalopathy (9%). Head imaging revealed abnormalities in 77% of patients. The most common neurological diagnosis for mortality (25.8%) was intracerebral haemorrhage (34.8%), followed by brain metastasis (26.1%).

These molecules promote survival of lymphoblasts by preventing apoptosis. Although O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins are over expressed, the status of O-acetylation of gangliosides and their role in lymphoblasts survival remains to be explored in ALL patients. Here, we have observed enhanced levels of 9-O-acetylated GD3 (9-O-AcGD3) in the lymphoblasts of patients and leukaemic cell line versus disialoganglioside GD3 in comparison to the normal cells. Localization of GD3 and 9-O-AcGD3 on mitochondria of patient's lymphoblasts has been demonstrated by immuno-electron microscopy. The exogenous administration of GD3-induced apoptosis in lymphoblasts as evident from the nuclear fragmentation and sub G0/G1 apoptotic peak. In contrast, 9-O-AcGD3 failed to induce such apoptosis. We further explored the mitochondria-dependent pathway triggered during GD3-induced apoptosis in lymphoblasts. GD3 caused a time-dependent depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and 7.4- and 8-fold increased in caspase 9 and caspase 3 activity respectively. However, under identical conditions, an equimolar concentration of 9-O-AcGD3 failed to induce similar effects. Interestingly, 9-O-AcGD3 protected the lymphoblasts from GD3-induced apoptosis when administered in equimolar concentrations simultaneously. In situ de-O-acetylation of 9-O-AcGD3 with sodium salicylate restores the GD3-responsiveness to apoptotic signals. Although both GD3 and 9-O-acetyl GD3 localize to mitochondria, these two structurally related molecules may play different roles in ALL-disease biology. Taken together, our results suggest that O-acetylation of GD3, like that of O-acetylated sialoglycoproteins, might be a general strategy adopted by leukaemic blasts towards survival in ALL.","['Mukherjee, Kankana', 'Chava, Anil Kumar', 'Mandal, Chandan', 'Dey, Sailendra Nath', 'Kniep, Bernhard', 'Chandra, Sarmila', 'Mandal, Chitra']","['Mukherjee K', 'Chava AK', 'Mandal C', 'Dey SN', 'Kniep B', 'Chandra S', 'Mandal C']","['Infectious Diseases and Immunology Division, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, Kolkata, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Gangliosides)', '62010-37-1 (ganglioside, GD3)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '98743-26-1 (9-O-acetyl-GD3 ganglioside)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Acetylation', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Gangliosides/analysis/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism']",2008/07/26 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21867 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Oct 15;105(3):724-34. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21867.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with histone deacetylase inhibitors have however indicated that EVI1-mediated repression can be only partially rescued by deacetylase inhibitor drugs, suggesting that additional chromosomal modifications might occur to induce gene repression by EVI1. To investigate whether histone methylation contributes to the repressive potential of EVI1, we examined a potential association between EVI1, the histone methyltransferase (HMT) SUV39H1, and methyltransferase activity in vitro. We find that EVI1 directly interacts with SUV39H1 and that the proteins form an active complex with methyltransferase activity in vitro. Our data indicate that SUV39H1 enhances the transcription repressive potential of EVI1 in vivo. We suggest that EVI1 affects promoters' activity in two different pathways, by association with histone deacetylases and by recruiting chromatin-modifying enzymes to impose a heterochromatin-like structure establishing a lasting transcription repression.","['Cattaneo, Francesca', 'Nucifora, Giuseppina']","['Cattaneo F', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.1.1.

To this end, they utilize dual-function organelles that combine properties of conventional lysosomes and exocytotic vesicles. Upon stimulation, these secretory lysosomes (SLs) release their cytotoxic molecules into the immunological synapse. In addition, several molecules associated with secretory vesicles become exposed on the plasma membrane. Recent studies often took advantage of the few established NK cell lines, for instance to analyze the exocytotic machinery associated with NK cell vesicles. NK cell lines and primary NK cells differ, however, substantially in the expression of ""typical"" surface receptors and their requirements to induce target cell lysis. Here, we directly compared the lysosomal compartments of different NK cell populations. We enriched SLs of two leukemic cell lines (YTS and NKL) and IL-2-expanded NK cells by subcellular fractionation and characterized their proteome by 2-D difference gel electrophoresis and MS. Although the overall protein composition of the lysosomal preparations was very similar and more than 90% of the proteins were present at comparable levels, we define a cell line-specific setup of functionally relevant proteins involved in antigen presentation and cytotoxic effector function.","['Schmidt, Hendrik', 'Gelhaus, Christoph', 'Nebendahl, Melanie', 'Lettau, Marcus', 'Watzl, Carsten', 'Kabelitz, Dieter', 'Leippe, Matthias', 'Janssen, Ottmar']","['Schmidt H', 'Gelhaus C', 'Nebendahl M', 'Lettau M', 'Watzl C', 'Kabelitz D', 'Leippe M', 'Janssen O']","['Institute of Immunology, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Proteomics,Proteomics,101092707,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism/physiology']",2008/07/26 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pmic.200800170 [doi]'],ppublish,Proteomics. 2008 Jul;8(14):2911-25. doi: 10.1002/pmic.200800170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enzyme kinetics of GTI-2040 in 3'-exonuclease solution were found to be well characterized by the Michaelis-Menten model, using the sum of formation rates of 3'N-1 and 3'N-2 (approximately total metabolism) because of sequential metabolism. In HLMs, a biphasic binding was observed for GTI-2040 with high- and low-affinity constants (K(d)s) of 0.03 and 3.8 microM, respectively. Enzyme kinetics of GTI-2040 in HLMs were found to deviate from Michaelis-Menten kinetics when the total GTI-2040 substrate was used. However, after correction for the unbound fractions, the formation rate of total metabolites could be described by Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Using the free substrate fraction, the K(m) and V(max) of GTI-2040 were determined to be 6.33 +/- 3.2 microM and 16.5 +/- 8.4 nmol/mg/h, respectively. Using these values, in vitro hepatic intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) in HLM was estimated to be 2.61 +/- 0.56 ml/h. The CL(int) was then used to predict GTI-2040's in vivo intrinsic clearance in humans by a microsomal protein scaling factor, which gave a mean value of 182.7 l/h, representing 24.1% of the observed in vivo mean scaled hepatic intrinsic clearance of 758.7 l/h in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. We concluded that the saturable nonspecific binding of GTI-2040 in HLMs complicated the interpretation of its enzyme kinetics, and scaled intrinsic clearance from HLMs only partially predicted the in vivo intrinsic clearance.","['Wei, Xiaohui', 'Dai, Guowei', 'Liu, Zhongfa', 'Cheng, Hao', 'Xie, Zhiliang', 'Klisovic, Rebecca', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Chan, Kenneth K']","['Wei X', 'Dai G', 'Liu Z', 'Cheng H', 'Xie Z', 'Klisovic R', 'Marcucci G', 'Chan KK']","['Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080724,United States,Drug Metab Dispos,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,9421550,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides)', '236391-66-5 (GTI2040)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Crotalus', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Male', 'Microsomes, Liver/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorothioate Oligonucleotides/administration & dosage/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2008/07/26 09:00,2009/11/17 06:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/11/17 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['dmd.108.021295 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.021295 [doi]']",ppublish,Drug Metab Dispos. 2008 Nov;36(11):2227-33. doi: 10.1124/dmd.108.021295.

HBZ gene expression not only inhibits the Tax-mediated activation of viral gene transcription through the 5' LTR but also promotes the proliferation of infected cells. However, the HBZ promoter region and the transcriptional regulation of the gene have not been studied. In this study, we characterize the promoters of the spliced version of the HBZ gene (sHBZ) and the unspliced version of the HBZ gene (usHBZ) by luciferase assay. Both promoters were TATA-less and contained initiators and downstream promoter elements. Detailed studies of the promoter for the sHBZ gene showed that Sp1 sites were critical for its activity. The activities of the sHBZ and usHBZ gene promoters were upregulated by Tax through Tax-responsible elements in the 3' LTR. We compared the functions of the proteins derived from the sHBZ and usHBZ transcripts. sHBZ showed a stronger suppression of Tax-mediated transcriptional activation through the 5' LTR than did usHBZ; the level of suppression correlated with the level of protein produced. The expression of sHBZ had a growth-promoting function in a T-cell line, while usHBZ expression did not. This study demonstrates that Sp1 is critical for sHBZ transcription, which accounts for the constitutive expression of the sHBZ gene. Functional differences between sHBZ and usHBZ suggest that the sHBZ gene plays a significant role in the proliferation of infected cells.","['Yoshida, Mika', 'Satou, Yorifumi', 'Yasunaga, Jun-Ichirou', 'Fujisawa, Jun-Ichi', 'Matsuoka, Masao']","['Yoshida M', 'Satou Y', 'Yasunaga J', 'Fujisawa J', 'Matsuoka M']","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, 53 Shogoin Kawahara-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080723,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Proteins/*genetics/*physiology']",2008/07/26 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00242-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00242-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Oct;82(19):9359-68. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00242-08.

It has been shown that dietary intake of xanthophyll helps to prevent age-related macular degeneration and the development of cataracts. It may also reduce the risk of developing various types of cancer. Here we showed that xanthophyll efficiently scavenged the stable free radical 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) with an IC50 of 0.5mM and effectively countered the cytotoxic effect of tert-butylhydroperoxide (tBuOOH) on various leukemic cell lines. In contrast, oxidized xanthophyll did not have these effects. We then examined whether dietary intake of xanthophyll inhibited leukemic tumor growth in mice injected subcutaneously with the leukemic cell line L1210. After one month, treatment with 13mg/kg xanthophyll had inhibited tumor growth by about 20%. Xanthophyll also enhanced the anti-leukemic activity of adriamycin in the L1210 mouse model as it extended the duration of adriamycin-induced suppression of tumor growth. Moreover, the two agents together reduced tumor volume by about 50% whereas treatment with adriamycin alone only stalled growth for a few days.

They can develop a leukaemia-like disease, haemic neoplasia, which could be induced, in part, by environmental stressors. The molluscan p53 tumor suppressor gene family was previously shown to be involved in haemic neoplasia at the protein level. The purpose of this study was the quantification of molluscan p53-like isoforms at the mRNA level in mussels with haemic neoplasia compared to normal controls. The three isoforms monitored were a p53-like, a TAp63/73-like containing an intact transactivation (TA) domain, and an NH(2)-terminally truncated p63/73 isoform termed DeltaNp63/p73-like that lacks the full TA domain. Using a comprehensive data set of 62 individual Mytilus trossulus and reverse transcription real-time PCR, we found that both the p53 and the DeltaNp63/73 isoforms were up-regulated in neoplastic haemocytes compared to normal haemocytes (p<0.0001). In contrast, the mRNA levels of the non-truncated isoform TAp63/73 did not change significantly in mussels with the disease at alpha=0.01 (p=0.0141), in contrast to previous findings at the protein level. Correlations in mRNA levels between the truncated isoform and the full-length isoforms in normal haemocytes were lost in neoplastic haemocytes. The increase in mRNA concentration of the truncated DeltaNp63/73 isoform in molluscan haemic neoplasia is similar to observations in many human cancers and cell lines and underlines the phylogenetically ancient oncogenic role of this isoform.","['Muttray, Annette F', 'Schulte, Patricia M', 'Baldwin, Susan A']","['Muttray AF', 'Schulte PM', 'Baldwin SA']","['University of British Columbia, Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, 2360 East Mall, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6T 1Z3. amuttray@vcn.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080625,England,Mar Environ Res,Marine environmental research,9882895,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Hemocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mytilus/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/07/26 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0141-1136(08)00177-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.marenvres.2008.06.004 [doi]']",ppublish,Mar Environ Res. 2008 Oct;66(4):412-21. doi: 10.1016/j.marenvres.2008.06.004.

We now show that Reg-2 is also upregulated by DRG neurons in inflammation with a very unusual expression pattern. In a rat model of monoarthritis, Reg-2 immunoreactivity was detected in DRG neurons at 1 day, peaked at 3 days (in 11.6% of DRG neurons), and was still present at 10 days (in 5%). Expression was almost exclusively in the population of DRG neurons that expresses the purinoceptor P2X(3) and binding sites for the lectin Griffonia simplicifolia IB4, and which is known to respond to glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). Immunoreactivity was present in DRG cell bodies and central terminals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In contrast, very little expression was seen in the nerve growth factor (NGF) responsive and substance P expressing population. However intrathecal delivery of GDNF did not induce Reg-2 expression, but leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) had a dramatic effect, inducing Reg-2 immunoreactivity in 39% of DRG neurons and 62% of P2X(3) cells. Changes in inflammation have previously been observed predominantly in the neuropeptide expressing, NGF responsive, DRG neurons. Our results show that changes also take place in the IB4 population, possibly driven by members of the LIF family of neuropoietic cytokines. In addition, the presence of Reg-2 in central axon terminals implicates Reg-2 as a possible modulator of second order dorsal horn cells.","['Averill, S', 'Inglis, J J', 'King, V R', 'Thompson, S W N', 'Cafferty, W B J', 'Shortland, P J', 'Hunt, S P', 'Kidd, B L', 'Priestley, J V']","['Averill S', 'Inglis JJ', 'King VR', 'Thompson SW', 'Cafferty WB', 'Shortland PJ', 'Hunt SP', 'Kidd BL', 'Priestley JV']","[""Neuroscience Centre, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Bart's & The London School of Medicine & Dentistry, Whitechapel, London E1 2AT, UK. s.a.averill@qmul.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080701,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lithostathine)', '0 (P2rx3 protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X3)', '0 (Reg1a protein, rat)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Ret protein, rat)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/*pathology', 'Ganglia, Spinal/*pathology', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/*physiology', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism', 'Indoles', 'Lectins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Lithostathine/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Neurons/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ret/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptor, trkA/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X3', 'Substance P/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/26 09:00,2009/02/07 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(08)00896-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.06.049 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2008 Sep 9;155(4):1227-36. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.06.049.

We tested differentiation conditions including the use of low oxygen, ascorbic acid, and prolonged in vitro differentiation time which resulted in a 10-fold increase in the number of MAP2-positive neurons (up to 40-50% of total cells as compared to controls). Under these conditions TH-ir cells constituted 4.3+/-0.5% of the neuronal population and displayed immature morphologies. Notably, the use of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) further increased the proportion of TH-ir neurons (up to 15% of total neurons).

Here, we have demonstrated that carnosic acid decreased viability of the human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, HL-60, in dose- and time-dependent manners, and induced G(1) arrest and apoptosis. Carnosic acid also augmented these effects when induced by a low (physiological) concentration of arsenic trioxide, which was associated with upregulation of p27 and activation of caspase-9. These effects appeared to be mediated by the induction of phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression. These findings indicate that PTEN plays an important role in the coordinated induction of apoptosis and G(1) arrest by carnosic acid and arsenic trioxide. Carnosic acid may have potential as an adjuvant in arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis therapy due to its anticipated safety and great potency in enhancing the apoptosis-inducing action of a low concentration of arsenic trioxide.","['Wang, R', 'Li, H', 'Guo, G', 'Li, X', 'Yu, X', 'Li, H', 'Wang, J', 'Liu, F', 'Chen, X']","['Wang R', 'Li H', 'Guo G', 'Li X', 'Yu X', 'Li H', 'Wang J', 'Liu F', 'Chen X']","['Department of Haematology, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Int Med Res,The Journal of international medical research,0346411,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (p27 antigen)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Abietanes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oxides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/metabolism']",2008/07/26 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/147323000803600409 [doi]'],ppublish,J Int Med Res. 2008 Jul-Aug;36(4):682-90. doi: 10.1177/147323000803600409.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several common polymorphisms of the EGFR gene have been described, at the level of both coding and regulatory sequences. Some of these polymorphisms are associated with alterations of EGFR expression and/or activity and may have an impact on the activity of anticancer agents. This study aims to analyze the relationships between specific EGFR functional polymorphisms and anticancer drug activity. METHOD: We investigated, in the panel of 60 human tumor cell lines established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI-60), whether the EGFR polymorphisms -216G>T, -191C>A, Arg521Lys (R521K), Val592Ala (V592A), and Cys624Phe (C624F), and the intron 1 (CA)n repeat were associated with EGFR gene expression and the in vitro cytotoxicity of anticancer agents using data extracted from the NCI database. We also looked for mutations of exons 18-21, known to enhance the activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and the deletion of exons 2-7, associated to the oncogenesis of glioblastomas. RESULTS: In the NCI-60 cell lines, only two mutations were observed, both in exon 19, in a leukemia and melanoma cell line. These mutations have not been described previously in clinical samples and their functional role is uncertain. The allele frequencies of the -216G>T, -191C>A, and R521K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NCI-60 panel were 33%, 8.5%, and 27%, respectively; the V592A and C624F SNPs were not found in any NCI-60 cell line. The intron 1 CA repeat was highly variable in the cell lines; 32 cell lines having a total number of repeats below 35, and 27 having a total number of repeats above 35. The heterozygous and variant homozygous cell lines for the -216G>T SNP presented a significantly higher expression of the EGFR gene than the homozygous wild-type lines. In contrast, there was no association between the -191C>A or R521K SNPs and EGFR gene expression. No association could be detected between the number of CA repeats in intron 1 and the expression of EGFR. The cell lines having at least one variant T allele at the -216G>T SNP were more sensitive to erlotinib and less sensitive to geldanamycin, topoisomerase I and II inhibitors, and alkylating agents than those without a variant allele. No relationship was detected between anticancer drug sensitivity and the -191C>A SNP. The R521K SNP was associated to lower sensitivity to alkylating agents. The number of CA repeats was associated with significant differences in anticancer drug activity: a high total number of CA repeats (>35 per diploid genome) was associated to increased sensitivity to alkylating agents and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. DISCUSSION: We provide evidence in this work that EGFR polymorphisms are associated with significant differences in the in vitro cytotoxicity of several types of DNA-interfering agents. Studies attempting a clinical validation of these clues are warranted.","['Puyo, Stephane', 'Le Morvan, Valerie', 'Robert, Jacques']","['Puyo S', 'Le Morvan V', 'Robert J']","['Universite de Bordeaux, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,New Zealand,Mol Diagn Ther,Molecular diagnosis & therapy,101264260,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*drug effects']",2008/07/26 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/26 09:00'],"['2008/07/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1244 [pii]', '10.1007/BF03256288 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Diagn Ther. 2008;12(4):225-34. doi: 10.1007/BF03256288.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conducted a population-based case-control study to evaluate the association between exposure to organic solvents and risk of myeloid and lymphoid leukemia and MM. METHODS: Five hundred eighty-six cases of leukemia (and 1,278 population controls), 263 cases of MM (and 1,100 population controls) were collected. Experts assessed exposure at individual level to a range of chemicals. RESULTS: We found no association between exposure to any solvent and AML. There were elevated point estimates for the associations between medium/high benzene exposure and chronic lymphatic leukemia (OR = 1.8, 95% CI = 0.9-3.9) and MM (OR = 1.9, 95% CI = 0.9-3.9). Risks of chronic lymphatic leukemia were somewhat elevated, albeit with wide confidence intervals, from medium/high exposure to xylene and toluene as well. CONCLUSIONS: We did not confirm the known association between benzene and AML, though this is likely explained by the strict regulation of benzene in Italy nearly three decades prior to study initiation. Our results support the association between benzene, xylene, and toluene and chronic lymphatic leukemia and between benzene and MM with longer latencies than have been observed for AML in other studies.","['Costantini, Adele Seniori', 'Benvenuti, Alessandra', 'Vineis, Paolo', 'Kriebel, David', 'Tumino, Rosario', 'Ramazzotti, Valerio', 'Rodella, Stefania', 'Stagnaro, Emanuele', 'Crosignani, Paolo', 'Amadori, Dino', 'Mirabelli, Dario', 'Sommani, Letizia', 'Belletti, Isabella', 'Troschel, Loredana', 'Romeo, Luciano', 'Miceli, Giuseppe', 'Tozzi, Giulio Andrea', 'Mendico, Igino', 'Maltoni, Simona Alberghini', 'Miligi, Lucia']","['Costantini AS', 'Benvenuti A', 'Vineis P', 'Kriebel D', 'Tumino R', 'Ramazzotti V', 'Rodella S', 'Stagnaro E', 'Crosignani P', 'Amadori D', 'Mirabelli D', 'Sommani L', 'Belletti I', 'Troschel L', 'Romeo L', 'Miceli G', 'Tozzi GA', 'Mendico I', 'Maltoni SA', 'Miligi L']","['Unit of Environmental and Occupational Epidemiology, Center for Study and Prevention of Cancer, Florence, Italy. a.seniori@cspo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,"['0 (Solvents)', '0 (Xylenes)', '3FPU23BG52 (Toluene)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*chemically induced', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Risk Assessment', 'Solvents/*adverse effects', 'Toluene/adverse effects', 'Xylenes/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2008/07/25 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/07/25 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajim.20592 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2008 Nov;51(11):803-11. doi: 10.1002/ajim.20592.,,['CA51086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Depletion of both JNK1 and JNK2 expression using siRNA transfection, protected against apoptosis, as detected by decreased nuclear fragmentation and caspase-3 activity, as well as reduced translocation of Bax to mitochondria. Moreover, release of cathepsin B and D from lysosomes to the cytosol was reduced when JNK expression was suppressed by siRNA, demonstrating a JNK dependent regulation of lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In unirradiated control melanocytes, coimmunoprecipitation showed that Bim was sequestered by Mcl-1, which had a pro-survival function. After UVB irradiation, a significant decrease in Mcl-1 protein level was found, which was prevented by addition of a proteasome inhibitor. The interaction between Bim and Mcl-1 was reduced in response to UVB irradiation and Bim was phosphorylated in a JNK dependent manner.

Whereas the copper(II) ion in 1 presents a square-planar geometry, in 2 it has a distorted octahedral environment. In addition, although the ligand is monodentate in both complexes, it exhibits different coordination behavior in each, interacting through the benzothiazole nitrogen atom in 1 and through the sulfonamide nitrogen atom in 2. The propensity for binding of 1 and 2 to calf thymus DNA was studied by thermal denaturation, viscosimetry, and cyclic voltammetry. The ability of the complexes to cleave DNA was studied in vitro through ascorbate activation and was tested by monitoring the expression of the yEGFP gene containing the RAD54 reporter. Moreover, their antiproliferative activity was verified in two cellular models: yeast and human tumor cells in culture. While 1 was found to be the more active cleaving agent in vitro, 2 showed a higher propensity for inflicting DNA damage at the cellular level.

The median duration of imatinib treatment was 68 (61-74) months. Two hundred fifty-three bone marrow samples were detected BCR-ABL messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by TaqMan-based real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The median time when CCyR was first achieved was eight (3-72) months. Thirty-four patients achieved major molecular response (MMoR), and their median time when MMoR was first achieved was 35 (3-65) months. More patients achieving CCyR within 18 months obtained MMoR than those after 18 months (85% vs 42%, p = 0.006). One patient progressed into blastic crisis, and four patients suffered cytogenetic relapse later. The estimated 6-year event-free survival (EFS) rate of all patients was 81%. The BCR-ABL mRNA levels at the time of first CCyR of relapsed patients were significantly higher than those in continuous CCyR (p = 0.011). The 6-year estimated EFS rate of MMoR patients was significantly higher than that of non-MMoR patients (100% vs 44%, p = 0.0001). Achieving CCyR within 18 months had a higher probability of achieving MMoR within 6 years. The 6-year estimated EFS rate was significantly higher for patients achieving CCyR within 12 months than those after 12 months (97% vs 55%, p = 0.05). The time when MMoR was first achieved did not affect 6-year estimated EFS. Therefore, imatinib could induce most late CP patients to achieve long-term durable responses after achieving CCyR. Both the time when CCyR was first achieved and the depth of BCR-ABL reduction after CCyR are relevant to long-term EFS.","['Qin, YaZhen', 'Jiang, Bin', 'Jiang, Qian', 'Jiang, Hao', 'Li, JinLan', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Zhu, HongHu', 'Li, LingDi', 'Chen, ShanShan', 'Liu, YanRong', 'Huang, XiaoJun']","['Qin Y', 'Jiang B', 'Jiang Q', 'Jiang H', 'Li J', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhu H', 'Li L', 'Chen S', 'Liu Y', 'Huang X']","[""Institute of Hematology, People's Hospital of Peking University, 11 Xi-zhi-men South Street, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080724,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",2008/07/25 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/07/25 09:00'],"['2008/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0548-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Jan;88(1):37-41. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0548-y.

Each of these oncogenes potentiates M1 leukemia in vivo. The zinc-finger transcription factor Egr-1 abrogates the block in M1 terminal differentiation imparted by oncogenic c-Myc or E2F-1, suppressing their leukemia-promoting function in nude mice. In this study, we asked whether Egr-1 also abrogates the block in terminal differentiation and suppresses leukemia imparted by deregulated c-Myb. Interestingly, the ectopic expression of Egr-1 in M1 cells expressing deregulated c-Myb only partially abrogated the block in terminal differentiation and did not suppress the leukemic phenotype. Two important implications from these data are that the leukemia suppressor function of Egr-1 is not directly related to how early the transforming oncogene blocks the differentiation program and that the tumor suppressor function of Egr-1 is dependent on the specific oncogene. Egr-1 is dominant to c-Myc- and E2F-1-, but not to c-Myb-, driven leukemia. These findings extend the notion that the molecular nature of genetic lesions responsible for leukemia determines the effectiveness of any given tumor suppressor.","['Gibbs, J D', 'Liebermann, D A', 'Hoffman, B']","['Gibbs JD', 'Liebermann DA', 'Hoffman B']","['Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080724,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cdk5r1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Early Growth Response Protein 1)', '0 (Egr1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/analysis', 'Early Growth Response Protein 1/*physiology', 'Genes, myb/*physiology', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phosphotransferases/analysis/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*physiology']",2008/07/25 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/07/25 09:00'],"['2008/07/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008189 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.189 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Oct;22(10):1909-16. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.189.

Besides the P-glycoprotein efflux, additional cellular factors may contribute to drug resistance in AML. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is activated after exposure of cells to chemotherapeutics. We asked whether chemoresistance in AML is attributed to intrinsic failure of the AML blasts to activate JNK. In vitro treatment of U937 AML cell line with anthracyclines induced a rapid and robust JNK phosphorylation and apoptosis. In contrast, the anthracyline-resistant derivative cell lines U937R and URD40 showed no JNK activation after exposure to anthracyclines, also at doses that resulted in high accumulation of the drug within the cells. RNA interference-based depletion of JNK1 in drug-sensitive U937 cells made them chemoresistant, whereas selective restoration of the inactive JNK pathway in the resistant U937R cells sensitized them to anthracyclines. Short-term in vitro exposure of primary AML cells (n=29) to daunorubicin showed a strong correlation between the in vitro pharmacodymanic changes of phospho-JNK levels and the response of patients to standard induction chemotherapy (P=0.012). We conclude that JNK activation failure confers another mechanism of anthracycline resistance in AML.

The expression of short isoforms lacking DNA-binding motifs alters the differentiation capacities of hematopoietic progenitors, arresting lineage commitment. We sought to determine whether molecular abnormalities involving the IKZF1 gene were associated with resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Using reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and nucleotide sequencing, only the non-DNA-binding Ik6 isoform was detected in 49% of Ph+ ALL patients. Ik6 was predominantly localized to the cytoplasm versus DNA-binding Ik1 or Ik2 isoforms, which showed nuclear localization. There was a strong correlation between nonfunctional Ikaros isoforms and BCR-ABL transcript level. Furthermore, patient-derived leukemia cells expressed oncogenic Ikaros isoforms before TKI treatment, but not during response to TKIs, and predominantly at the time of relapse. In vitro overexpression of Ik6 strongly increased DNA synthesis and inhibited apoptosis in TKI-sensitive cells. Genomic sequence and computational analyses of exon splice junction regions of IKZF1 in Ph+ ALL patients predicted several mutations that may alter alternative splicing. These results establish a previously unknown link between specific molecular defects that involve alternative splicing of the IKZF1 gene and the resistance to TKIs in Ph+ ALL patients.","['Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Messa, Francesca', 'Cilloni, Daniela', 'Arruga, Francesca', 'Ottaviani, Emanuela', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Giannoulia, Panagiota', 'Soverini, Simona', 'Amabile, Marilina', 'Poerio, Angela', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Pane, Fabrizio', 'Berton, Giorgio', 'Baruzzi, Anna', 'Vitale, Antonella', 'Chiaretti, Sabina', 'Perini, Giovanni', 'Foa, Robin', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Iacobucci I', 'Lonetti A', 'Messa F', 'Cilloni D', 'Arruga F', 'Ottaviani E', 'Paolini S', 'Papayannidis C', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Giannoulia P', 'Soverini S', 'Amabile M', 'Poerio A', 'Saglio G', 'Pane F', 'Berton G', 'Baruzzi A', 'Vitale A', 'Chiaretti S', 'Perini G', 'Foa R', 'Baccarani M', 'Martinelli G']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, L. and A.

Rituximab (RTX), a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20 on B lymphocytes and widely used in other indolent B cell neoplasms is less efficacious in CLL, possibly due to associated complement deficiencies. OBJECTIVE: To examine in open trial whether providing complement by concurrent administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) will enhance the effect of RTX in CLL. SETTING: Outpatient haematology clinics in Israel and Greece. PATIENTS: Five patients with severe treatment-resistant CLL. All had been previously treated with fludarabine and three also failed treatment with RTX. INTERVENTION: Two units of FFP followed with RTX 375 mg/m(2) as a single agent, repeated every 1-2 weeks, as needed. RESULTS: A rapid and dramatic clinical and laboratory response was achieved in all patients.

Nor is there adequate clarity on analgesic strategies for children with cancer undergoing painful procedures. PROCEDURES: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, factorial trial was performed in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergoing combined bone marrow aspirations and lumbar punctures during maintenance therapy. The study was designed to measure the effect of adding ondansetron and fentanyl to a standard combination of midazolam and propofol. RESULTS: During the first 12 hr following the procedures, patients experienced significantly less vomiting/retching and less disruption of activity while receiving ondansetron, and recorded significantly lower pain scores while receiving fentanyl. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that the addition of an analgesic (fentanyl) and an anti-emetic (ondansetron) to the combination of a sedative (midazolam) and an anesthetic (propofol) is of measurable benefit in children who undergo procedures that are painful and risk the consequence of nausea and vomiting.","['Nagel, Kim', 'Willan, Andrew R', 'Lappan, Janie', 'Korz, Linda', 'Buckley, Norman', 'Barr, Ronald D']","['Nagel K', 'Willan AR', 'Lappan J', 'Korz L', 'Buckley N', 'Barr RD']","[""McMaster Children's Hospital, Hamilton, Ontario.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antiemetics)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypnotics and Sedatives)', '4AF302ESOS (Ondansetron)', 'R60L0SM5BC (Midazolam)', 'UF599785JZ (Fentanyl)', 'YI7VU623SF (Propofol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antiemetics/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy, Needle/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Examination/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Conscious Sedation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fentanyl/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hypnotics and Sedatives/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Injections, Spinal', 'Male', 'Midazolam/administration & dosage', 'Ondansetron/administration & dosage', 'Pain/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting/*prevention & control', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Propofol/administration & dosage', 'Spinal Puncture/adverse effects']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21669 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Nov;51(5):634-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21669.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, very little is known about second primary tumors in men. Risk factors for breast cancer in men, including genetic, hormonal and environmental factors, provide parallels to the etiology of breast cancer in women. This review considers the literature related to the risk of developing a second cancer in patients with male breast cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review of the literature between 1966 and 2007 was conducted and acceptable articles used for analysis. All retrieved articles were screened to identify any papers that had been missed. Studies were included if they discussed the risk of subsequent malignancy in patients with male breast cancer. RESULTS: Patients with history of male breast cancer have an increased risk of a second ipsilateral, or contralateral breast cancer (standardized incidence ratio 30-110). The risk of subsequent contralateral breast cancer was highest in men under 50 years of age at the time of the diagnosis of the initial cancer. The data on non-breast second primary cancers is diverse. One study has suggested an increased incidence of cancers of the small intestine, prostate, rectum and pancreas, and of non-melanoma skin cancer and myeloid leukaemia. Other investigators did not find an increase in the overall risk of subsequent cancer development in men diagnosed initially with primary breast cancer. Although sarcoma, lung and esophageal cancers are well recognized complications of radiation therapy for female breast cancer, there is no evidence for the association of these cancers following radiation therapy in male breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of second primary cancer in patients with primary male breast cancer requires further study, male breast cancer survivors should probably undergo periodic screening for the early detection of second breast cancers and other adverse health effects.","['Grenader, Tal', 'Goldberg, Anthony', 'Shavit, Linda']","['Grenader T', 'Goldberg A', 'Shavit L']","[""Department of Oncology, Sha'are Zedek Medical Center, P.O.

Also, it is unclear if a safe anthracycline-dose exists at all. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cardiac function was assessed in 23 long-term ALL-survivors with a median follow-up of 22 years (range 19.5-24.5) post-treatment. Age at diagnosis and current age were 5.0 (2.0-14.0) and 29.0 (24.0-39.0) years. All 23 survivors were treated according to DCLSG protocol ALL-5, including 18-25 Gy cranial irradiation. Thirteen of them received 4 x 25 mg/m(2) daunorubicin by randomization. Cardiac evaluation included blood pressure measurement, echocardiography, and (24 h-) electrocardiogram. Results were compared with an earlier assessment at median 12 years post-treatment. RESULTS: None of the survivors had cardiac abnormalities. Cardiac status of daunorubicin-treated survivors showed no deterioration compared with the previous assessment in 1995. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: After prolonged follow-up (more than 20 years post-treatment), ALL-survivors treated with low dose daunorubicin had no clinical relevant deterioration of cardiac function.","['Brouwer, C A J', 'Gietema, J A', 'van den Berg, M P', 'Bink-Boelkens, M T E', 'Elzenga, N J', 'Haaksma, J', 'Kamps, W A', 'Vonk, J M', 'Postma, A']","['Brouwer CA', 'Gietema JA', 'van den Berg MP', 'Bink-Boelkens MT', 'Elzenga NJ', 'Haaksma J', 'Kamps WA', 'Vonk JM', 'Postma A']","['Subdivision Paediatric Oncology, Department of Paediatrics, University Medical Centre Groningen, University of Groningen, P.O.

The purpose of this review is to look at the association and potential impact of diabetes mellitus on the health profiles of a large cohort of cancer survivors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study of long-term cancer survivors who reported that they have diabetes. Of 8,559 respondents to a mailed survey, 696 (8.1%) reported diabetes mellitus (DM). We analyzed the responses to discern the potential impact of demographics, cancer type, or disease treatments on glycemia as well as the potential impact of DM on socioeconomic parameters (education, family and work). RESULTS: Survivors of gynecological cancer, chronic leukemia, or gastrointestinal cancer reported DM most frequently, although no statistical correlations could be demonstrated for DM and specific cancer types. The frequency of DM was higher among survivors than in the general U.S. population. Cancer survivors with DM were more likely to report that cancer affected their overall health (42.3 vs. 34.3%) and ability to work. They also reported more health problems. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes mellitus affects a minority of long-term cancer survivors and may have an impact on their physiologic and psychosocial well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Systematic assessment for DM is suggested for all cancer survivors because DM appears to be an important co-morbidity for this growing segment of our population.","['Stava, Charles J', 'Beck, Martha L', 'Feng, Lei', 'Lopez, Adriana', 'Busaidy, Naifa', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin, Rena']","['Stava CJ', 'Beck ML', 'Feng L', 'Lopez A', 'Busaidy N', 'Vassilopoulou-Sellin R']","['Department of Endocrine Neoplasia and Hormonal Disorders, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Box 435, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,J Cancer Surviv,Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,101307557,,IM,"['Adult', 'Comorbidity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Sickness Impact Profile', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States/epidemiology']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11764-007-0016-z [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Surviv. 2007 Jun;1(2):108-15. doi: 10.1007/s11764-007-0016-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most prevalent NHL subtypes diagnosed using WHO criteria were diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Although a low incidence has been reported in some Asian populations, CLL/SLL was commonly encountered, indicating that chronic lymphoid neoplasms are not rare in Shanghai. Consistent with previous reports, our findings indicate a decrease in the frequency of follicular lymphoma and an increase in T cell neoplasms compared to the West. Precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, anaplastic large T cell lymphoma, aggressive NK cell leukemia, angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma and peripheral T cell lymphoma were prominent subtypes of T cell NHL.","['Gross, Sherilyn A', 'Zhu, Xiongzeng', 'Bao, Liming', 'Ryder, John', 'Le, Anh', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wang, Xiao Qin', 'Irons, Richard D']","['Gross SA', 'Zhu X', 'Bao L', 'Ryder J', 'Le A', 'Chen Y', 'Wang XQ', 'Irons RD']","['Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 130 Dong An Road, 200032, Shanghai, China.', 'Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Cancer Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 130 Dong An Road, 200032, Shanghai, China.', ""Division of Human Genetics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 130 Dong An Road, 200032, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 130 Dong An Road, 200032, Shanghai, China.', 'Fudan-Cinpathogen Clinical and Molecular Research Center, Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, Fudan University, 130 Dong An Road, 200032, Shanghai, China. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, School of Pharmacy, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Denver, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Cinpathogen, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.', 'Cinpathogen, Inc., Shanghai, China. richard.irons@cinpathogen.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080723,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Asians/*statistics & numerical data', 'China/epidemiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*classification/*ethnology/genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data', 'World Health Organization']",2008/07/24 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0132-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0132-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Sep;88(2):165-173. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0132-1.

METHODS: Eligible patients had relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) treated with one or two prior regimens, low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with one or two prior regimens, or aggressive NHL treated with one prior regimen. The first nine patients received 9-AC dimethylacetamide 0.85 mg/m(2) per day intravenously over 72 h every 2 weeks and the remaining 27 patients received 9-AC/colloidal dispersion 1.1 mg/m(2) per day. Patients received a minimum of three cycles unless progression or intolerable toxicity occurred. Responding patients received two cycles past best response with a minimum of six cycles. RESULTS: CALGB 9551 accrued 37 patients from April 1996 through October 2000; one patient with HD, 18 patients with indolent lymphoma, and 17 patients with aggressive lymphoma. The overall response rate was 17%, with response rates of 11% (2 partial responses) in patients with indolent histologies and 23% (1 complete response, 3 partial responses) in patients with aggressive histologies. The patient with HD did not respond. Response rates were similar for both drug formulations. The median remission duration for the six responders was 6.5 months, with one remission lasting longer than 12 months. Significant grade 3 and 4 toxicities included neutropenia (66%), anemia (31%), and thrombocytopenia (36%), with 20% of patients experiencing grade 3 or 4 infection. No treatment related deaths occurred. Steady state serum concentrations did not correlate with patient response or toxicity.

The name ""GIST"" was proposed in 1983, but the cell origin of GIST remained unclear until 1998, when my colleagues and I reported immunohistochemical evidence that GIST originated from interstitial cells of Cajal or their precursors. At the same time, we reported gain-of-function mutations of the Kit gene in GISTs. The Kit gene encodes KIT receptor tyrosine kinase, whose structure is similar to that of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Imatinib mesylate was initially developed as an inhibitor of PDGFR. Then, it was found to be a potent inhibitor of BCR-ABL. Imatinib was successfully used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia. When we reported gain-of-function mutations of the Kit gene in GISTs, the inhibitory effect of imatinib on KIT was already known. Imatinib was then successfully applied to the treatment of GISTs. The interrelationship between the type of Kit gain-of-function mutation and the therapeutic effect of imatinib has been well characterized in GISTs. Although various mutations of Kit and Pdgfr-alpha genes have been found in GISTs, most GISTs are luckily imatinibsensitive.

Most of these studies have been performed where the radiation has been delivered at intermediate to high dose-rates (30-3000 mGy/min), where the threshold dose for induction of neoplastic transformation is around 100-200 mGy. Below these doses, the transformation frequency is less than that seen spontaneously, indicative of a hormetic effect. More recently, data have been obtained for low dose rates (<0.5 mGy/min) of low-LET radiation, and again hormetic effects are apparent but with threshold doses now being >1000 mGy. Similar trends have been reported in animal experiments as well as in human epidemiologic studies. Indeed, the relative risks for induction of neoplastic transformation in vitro in the dose range 1 to 1000 mGy agree well with those for incidence of radiation-induced breast cancer and leukemia in humans. These findings support the notion that the endpoint of neoplastic transformation in vitro is a plausible endpoint to not only study mechanisms involved in response to low doses of radiation, but also to provide information of potential importance to risk assessment.","['Redpath, J Leslie', 'Elmore, Eugene']","['Redpath JL', 'Elmore E']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA. jlredpat@uci.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20061206,United States,Dose Response,Dose-response : a publication of International Hormesis Society,101308899,,,,2008/07/24 09:00,2008/07/24 09:01,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/24 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2203/dose-response.06-010.Redpath [doi]'],epublish,Dose Response. 2006 Dec 6;5(2):123-30. doi: 10.2203/dose-response.06-010.Redpath.,,,PMC2477692,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['hormesis', 'low dose', 'neoplastic transformation', 'radiation', 'risk assessment']",,,,,,

Here we summarize three methodologies developed in our laboratory to model chromosomal translocations (knock-in, translocator, and invertor methods). We have used these models to study leukemias caused by fusions of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene and the Ews-ERG fusion gene to evaluate oncogenicity and elucidate some general principles about translocation products. We show that MLL fusions have the capacity to cause hematopoietic tumors only if expressed in permissive cells and that the Mll-Enl fusion can cause lineage reassignment if the chromosomal translocation occurs in lineage noncommitted progenitors. The leukemia-initiating cells generated by Mll fusions or by Ews-ERG fusion can be committed cells within the hematopoietic pathway. Our translocation mimic models are applicable to any human reciprocal chromosomal translocation.","['Lobato, M Natividad', 'Metzler, Markus', 'Drynan, Lesley', 'Forster, Alan', 'Pannell, Richard', 'Rabbitts, Terence H']","['Lobato MN', 'Metzler M', 'Drynan L', 'Forster A', 'Pannell R', 'Rabbitts TH']","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr,Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Tumor susceptibility genes of BALB/c, such as weak efficiency alleles of genes encoding p16(Ink4a) and Frap (mTOR), are also required for plasmacytoma, although the pathways linking these genes with deregulated Myc and the environment have not yet been elucidated. The findings in mouse plasmacytoma may be relevant for hematopoietic neoplasms in human beings, in which leukemia- and lymphoma-associated chromosomal translocation (LLA-CT) is much more frequent than subsequent neoplasia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective population-based study investigated AML risk after a prior BC diagnosis and compared the results with women after a prior diagnosis of hematological malignancies (HM), other cancers combined (OCC), and the age-matched Australian female population. RESULTS: Women with a prior BC diagnosis had 2.56 times the risk of developing AML compared with the Australian female population (P<0.001). AML risk was also elevated after prior HM and OCC diagnoses (4.73, P<0.001, and 1.70, P<0.001, respectively). Although the incidence of AML rose sharply with age in all cohorts, the age-specific relative risk was highest in the 30- to 49-age-group and decreased with increasing age. AML risk increased with the duration of follow-up but there was no change of risk during the 23 years of this study. CONCLUSION: AML risk was elevated after a prior diagnosis of BC but there was no evidence of an increasing risk of AML after a BC diagnosis or, in any of the other cancer cohorts, during this era of expansion of the evidence base for more intensive treatments.","['Beadle, G', 'Baade, P', 'Fritschi, L']","['Beadle G', 'Baade P', 'Fritschi L']","['Department of Translational Research Laboratory, Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia. geoffBe@qimr.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080722,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Australia/epidemiology', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/07/24 09:00,2009/03/20 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)39949-1 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn530 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2009 Jan;20(1):103-9. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn530.

To effectively purify these enzyme mutants for further investigation, a native preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is developed. The simplicity and reproducibility of this approach permits the purification of different mutants from the crude enzyme extracts, with a sufficient activity to perform immunological and biological studies. Furthermore, the newly developed method is efficient and cost-effective compared with other methods, such as column chromatography and affinity chromatography.

For the past 30 years, these enzymes have been used as therapeutic agents in the treatment of acute childhood lymphoblastic leukemia. Their intrinsic low-rate glutaminase activity, however, causes serious side-effects, including neurotoxicity, hepatitis, coagulopathy, and other dysfunctions. Erwinia carotovora asparaginase shows decreased glutaminase activity, so it is believed to have fewer side-effects in leukemia therapy. To gain detailed insights into the properties of E. carotovora asparaginase, combined crystallographic, thermal stability and cytotoxic experiments were performed. The crystal structure of E. carotovoral-asparaginase in the presence of L-Asp was determined at 2.5 A resolution and refined to an R cryst of 19.2 (R free = 26.6%) with good stereochemistry. Cytotoxicity measurements revealed that E. carotovora asparaginase is 30 times less toxic than the Escherichia coli enzyme against human leukemia cell lines. Moreover, denaturing experiments showed that E. carotovora asparaginase has decreased thermodynamic stability as compared to the E. coli enzyme and is rapidly inactivated in the presence of urea. On the basis of these results, we propose that E. carotovora asparaginase has limited potential as an antileukemic drug, despite its promising low glutaminase activity. Our analysis may be applicable to the therapeutic evaluation of other asparaginases as well.","['Papageorgiou, Anastassios C', 'Posypanova, Galina A', 'Andersson, Charlotta S', 'Sokolov, Nikolay N', 'Krasotkina, Julya']","['Papageorgiou AC', 'Posypanova GA', 'Andersson CS', 'Sokolov NN', 'Krasotkina J']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Finland. tassos.papageorgiou@btk.fi']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pectobacterium carotovorum/*enzymology', 'Protein Conformation', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJB6574 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06574.x [doi]']",ppublish,FEBS J. 2008 Sep;275(17):4306-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06574.x.

We evaluated the depth of cytopenias to determine whether this parameter could further refine the prognostic ability of the IPSS. Correlation was determined between the depth of cytopenias in 816 patients from the International MDS Risk Analysis Workshop database and patients' clinical features. Univariate analyses of hemoglobin (Hb), absolute neutrophil count, and platelet depth levels were assessed relative to the IPSS risk groups, refined French-American-British categories, cytogenetic groups, bone marrow blast percentage (%), age groups, overall survival (OS), and time to evolution of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Multivariate analysis of different cytopenic levels was performed to determine whether depth of cytopenias was prognostically additive to the IPSS. All cytopenic categories had statistically significant rank correlations with IPSS, bone marrow blast %, and refined French-American-British categories. In multivariate analysis, Hb levels had additive prognostic value to the IPSS for evaluation of OS, but not time to AML, with greatest prognostic value in Intermediate-1 and Intermediate-2 categories. In contrast, platelet or absolute neutrophil count levels alone or in combination lacked additive prognostic value to the IPSS regarding OS or time to AML evolution. The depth of Hb level per se at the time of diagnosis has additive predictive value to the IPSS for OS in the intermediate-risk groups.

In acute leukemia, thrombosis and bleeding manifestations may occur concomitantly as a part of the same thrombo-hemorrhagic syndrome. In patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (i.e., essential thrombocythemia [ET] and polycythemia vera [PV]), a thrombosis rate as high as 40% has been recorded. A hypercoagulable state is present in virtually all of these patients, even without clinical manifestations. In this review, we focus on the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the hypercoagulable state of these two hematologic malignancies. Although the pathogenesis of hypercoagulability is complex, a central role is played by the fundamental molecular changes of both the leukemic cells and of the progeny arising from the hematopoietic progenitor cells that have undergone clonal rearrangement. These cells overexpress procoagulant factors, as well as adhesion molecules and cytokines capable of inducing procoagulant changes in the vascular wall and stimulating increased cellular interactions. Recent molecular studies in experimental models of human tumors have demonstrated for the first time that oncogene- and repressor gene-mediated neoplastic transformation induces activation of blood coagulation. Similarly, in cells from patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia, the T15-17 translocation induces hyperexpression of tissue factor (TF) and renders the patient hypercoagulable. Furthermore, in blood cells from patients with PV or ET, the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation translates into activation of hemostasis, with increased expression of platelet-associated TF microparticles and the formation of increased platelet/neutrophil aggregates. Understanding the pathophysiology of hypercoagulability is critical to the design of appropriate measures for intervention in these hematologic disorders to prevent thromboembolic complications.","['Falanga, Anna', 'Barbui, Tiziano', 'Rickles, Frederick R']","['Falanga A', 'Barbui T', 'Rickles FR']","['Department Hematology/Oncology, Ospedali Riuniti di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy. annafalanga@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,['9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)'],IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Hemostasis/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/blood', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/blood', 'Polycythemia Vera/blood/genetics', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/genetics', 'Thrombophilia/*genetics', 'Thromboplastin/*genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1079262 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2008 Mar;34(2):204-10. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1079262.,44,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence was provided that heparanase overexpression in human leukemia, glioma, and breast carcinoma cells results in a marked increase in tissue factor (TF) levels. Likewise, TF was induced by exogenous addition of recombinant heparanase to tumor cells and primary endothelial cells, induction that was mediated by p38 phosphorylation and correlated with enhanced procoagulant activity. TF induction was further confirmed in heparanase-overexpressing transgenic mice and correlated with heparanase expression levels in leukemia patients. Heparanase was also found to be involved in the regulation of tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI). It was shown that heparanase overexpression or exogenous addition induces two- to threefold increase of TFPI expression. Similarly, heparanase stimulated accumulation of TFPI in the cell culture medium. Extracellular accumulation exceeded, however, the observed increase in TFPI at the protein level and appeared to be independent of heparan sulfate and heparanase enzymatic activity. Instead, a physical interaction between heparanase and TFPI was demonstrated, suggesting a mechanism by which secreted heparanase interacts with TFPI on the cell surface, leading to dissociation of TFPI from the cell membrane and increased coagulation activity, thus further supporting the local prothrombotic function of heparanase. As heparins are strong inhibitors of heparanase, in view of the effect of heparanase on TF/TFPI pathway, the role of heparins' anticoagulant activity may potentially be expanded.","['Nadir, Yona', 'Vlodavsky, Israel', 'Brenner, Benjamin']","['Nadir Y', 'Vlodavsky I', 'Brenner B']","['Thrombosis and Hemostasis Unit, Department of Hematology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. ynadir@netvision.net.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (heparanase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endothelial Cells/metabolism', 'Glucuronidase/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/physiopathology', 'Neoplasms/*physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/physiopathology', 'Thromboplastin/biosynthesis/*physiology']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1079259 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2008 Mar;34(2):187-94. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1079259.,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed outcome for 319 patients with CML-CP who were treated with imatinib; 171 were in early CP (ECP) and 148 were in late CP (LCP). Patients were screened routinely for mutations using direct sequencing regardless of response status. The 5-year cumulative incidence of mutations was 6.6% for ECP and 17% for LCP patients. RESULTS: Of the 319 patients, 214 (67%) achieved complete cytogenetic responses (CCyR). The identification of a mutation without other evidence of imatinib resistance was highly predictive for loss of CCyR (RR, 3.8; P = .005) and for progression to advanced phase (RR, 2.3; P = .01), though the intervals from first identification to loss of CCyR and disease progression were relatively long (median, 21 and 16 months, respectively). Mutations in the P-loop (excluding residue 244) were associated with a higher risk of progression than mutations elsewhere. CONCLUSION: We conclude that routine mutation screening of patients who appear to be responding to imatinib may identify those at high risk of disease progression.","['Khorashad, Jamshid S', 'de Lavallade, Hugues', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Bua, Marco', 'Szydlo, Richard', 'Olavarria, Eduardo', 'Kaeda, Jaspal', 'Goldman, John M', 'Marin, David']","['Khorashad JS', 'de Lavallade H', 'Apperley JF', 'Milojkovic D', 'Reid AG', 'Bua M', 'Szydlo R', 'Olavarria E', 'Kaeda J', 'Goldman JM', 'Marin D']","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospitals Trust, Imperial College London, Du Cane Rd, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Phosphotransferases/*genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.9953 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.9953 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 10;26(29):4806-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.9953.

Analysis focused on alloreactive single-KIR(+) NK cells, which reportedly are potent antileukemic effectors. One month after HSCT, CD56(bright)/CD56(dim) NK-cell subsets showed inverted ratio and phenotypic features. CD25 and CD117 down-regulation on CD56(bright), and NKG2A and CD62L up-regulation on CD56(dim), suggest sequential CD56(bright)-to-CD56(dim) NK-cell maturation in vivo. Consistently, the functional potential of these maturation intermediates against leukemic blasts was impaired. Mature receptor repertoire reconstitution took at least 3 months. Importantly, at this time point, supposedly alloreactive, single-KIR(+) NK cells were not yet fully functional. Frequency of these cells was highly variable, independently from predicted NK alloreactivity, and below 1% of NK cells in 3 of 6 alloreactive patients studied. In line with these observations, no clinical benefit of predicted NK alloreactivity was observed in the total cohort of 56 patients. Our findings unravel the kinetics, and limits, of NK-cell differentiation from purified haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells in vivo, and suggest that NK-cell antileukemic potential could be best exploited by infusion of mature single-KIR(+) NK cells selected from an alloreactive donor.","['Vago, Luca', 'Forno, Barbara', 'Sormani, Maria Pia', 'Crocchiolo, Roberto', 'Zino, Elisabetta', 'Di Terlizzi, Simona', 'Lupo Stanghellini, Maria Teresa', 'Mazzi, Benedetta', 'Perna, Serena K', 'Bondanza, Attilio', 'Middleton, Derek', 'Palini, Alessio', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Bacchetta, Rosa', 'Peccatori, Jacopo', 'Rossini, Silvano', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Bonini, Chiara', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Fleischhauer, Katharina']","['Vago L', 'Forno B', 'Sormani MP', 'Crocchiolo R', 'Zino E', 'Di Terlizzi S', 'Lupo Stanghellini MT', 'Mazzi B', 'Perna SK', 'Bondanza A', 'Middleton D', 'Palini A', 'Bernardi M', 'Bacchetta R', 'Peccatori J', 'Rossini S', 'Roncarolo MG', 'Bordignon C', 'Bonini C', 'Ciceri F', 'Fleischhauer K']","['San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (HSR-TIGET), Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) H San Raffaele, via Olgettina 60, 20132, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'CD56 Antigen/biosynthesis', 'Cell Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59758-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-103325 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 15;112(8):3488-99. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-103325.

Prep1-hypomorphic (Prep1(i/i)) mice exhibit an absolute reduction in circulating insulin levels but normal glucose tolerance. In addition, these mice exhibit protection from streptozotocin-induced diabetes and enhanced insulin sensitivity with improved glucose uptake and insulin-dependent glucose disposal by skeletal muscle. This muscle phenotype does not depend on reduced expression of the known Prep1 transcription partner, Pbx1. Instead, in Prep1(i/i) muscle, we find normal Pbx1 but reduced levels of the recently identified novel Prep1 interactor p160. Consistent with this reduction, we find a muscle-selective increase in mRNA and protein levels of PGC-1alpha, accompanied by enhanced expression of the GLUT4 transporter, responsible for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscle. Indeed, using L6 skeletal muscle cells, we induced the opposite effects by overexpressing Prep1 or p160, but not Pbx1. In vivo skeletal muscle delivery of p160 cDNA in Prep1(i/i) mice also reverses the molecular phenotype. Finally, we show that Prep1 controls the stability of the p160 protein.

Using the K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line and the doxorubicin-resistant derivative lines KD30 and KD225 as models, we observed that enhanced PI3K/Akt activity and the acquisition of chemoresistance correlated unexpectedly with the increased expression and nuclear accumulation of FOXO3a. Moreover, we found that the induction of FOXO3a activity in naive K562 cells was sufficient to enhance PI3K/Akt activity and to confer resistance to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin. Conversely, the knockdown of endogenous FOXO3a expression reduced PI3K/Akt activity and sensitized these cells to doxorubicin. Further chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter mutation analyses demonstrated that FOXO3a regulates the expression of the PI3K catalytic subunit p110alpha through the activation of a promoter region proximal to a novel untranslated exon upstream from the reported transcription start site of the p110alpha gene PIK3CA. As was the case for FOXO3a, the expression or knockdown of p110alpha was sufficient to amplify or reduce PI3K/Akt activity, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that the chronic activation of FOXO3a by doxorubicin in CML cells can enhance survival through a feedback mechanism that involves enhanced p110alpha expression and hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway.","['Hui, Rosaline C-Y', 'Gomes, Ana R', 'Constantinidou, Demetra', 'Costa, Joana R', 'Karadedou, Christina T', 'Fernandez de Mattos, Silvia', 'Wymann, Matthias P', 'Brosens, Jan J', 'Schulze, Almut', 'Lam, Eric W-F']","['Hui RC', 'Gomes AR', 'Constantinidou D', 'Costa JR', 'Karadedou CT', 'Fernandez de Mattos S', 'Wymann MP', 'Brosens JJ', 'Schulze A', 'Lam EW']","['Cancer Research-UK Laboratories, Department of Oncology, MRC Cyclotron Building, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exons', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.01265-07 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.01265-07 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Oct;28(19):5886-98. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01265-07.

The SNF2-like ATPase containing nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase corepressor complex (NuRD) is involved in gene transcriptional repression and chromatin remodeling. We have previously shown that the leukemogenic protein PML-RARa represses target genes through recruitment of DNA methytransferases and Polycomb complex. Here, we demonstrate a direct role of the NuRD complex in aberrant gene repression and transmission of epigenetic repressive marks in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). We show that PML-RARa binds and recruits NuRD to target genes, including to the tumor-suppressor gene RARbeta2. In turn, the NuRD complex facilitates Polycomb binding and histone methylation at lysine 27. Retinoic acid treatment, which is often used for patients at the early phase of the disease, reduced the promoter occupancy of the NuRD complex. Knockdown of the NuRD complex in leukemic cells not only prevented histone deacetylation and chromatin compaction but also impaired DNA and histone methylation, as well as stable silencing, thus favoring cellular differentiation. These results unveil an important role for NuRD in the establishment of altered epigenetic marks in APL, demonstrating an essential link between chromatin structure and epigenetics in leukemogenesis that could be exploited for therapeutic intervention.","['Morey, Lluis', 'Brenner, Carmen', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Villa, Raffaella', 'Gutierrez, Arantxa', 'Buschbeck, Marcus', 'Nervi, Clara', 'Minucci, Saverio', 'Fuks, Francois', 'Di Croce, Luciano']","['Morey L', 'Brenner C', 'Fazi F', 'Villa R', 'Gutierrez A', 'Buschbeck M', 'Nervi C', 'Minucci S', 'Fuks F', 'Di Croce L']","['Centre de Regulacio Genomica, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MBD3 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', '*Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mi-2 Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase Complex', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00467-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00467-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Oct;28(19):5912-23. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00467-08.

Posttranslational modifications of BMAL1 play a key role in modulating the transcriptional activity of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex during the circadian cycle. Recently, we demonstrated that circadian activation of the heterodimeric transcription factor is accompanied by ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of BMAL1. Here we show that modification by SUMO localizes BMAL1 exclusively to the promyelocytic leukemia nuclear body (NB) and simultaneously promotes its transactivation and ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Under physiological conditions, BMAL1 was predominantly conjugated to poly-SUMO2/3 rather than SUMO1, and the level of these conjugates underwent rhythmic variation, peaking at times of maximum E-box-mediated circadian transcription. Interestingly, mutation of the sumoylation site (Lys(259)) of BMAL1 markedly inhibited both its ubiquitination and its proteasome-mediated proteolysis, and these effects were reversed by covalent attachment of SUMO3 to the C terminus of the mutant BMAL1. Consistent with this, SUSP1, a SUMO protease highly specific for SUMO2/3, abolished ubiquitination, as well as sumoylation of BMAL1, while the ubiquitin protease UBP41 blocked BMAL1 ubiquitination but induced accumulation of polysumoylated BMAL1 and its localization to the NB. Furthermore, inhibition of proteasome with MG132 elicited robust nuclear accumulation of SUMO2/3- and ubiquitin-modified BMAL1 that was restricted to the transcriptionally active stage of the circadian cycle. These results indicate that dual modification of BMAL1 by SUMO2/3 and ubiquitin is essential for circadian activation and degradation of the CLOCK/BMAL1 complex.","['Lee, Jiwon', 'Lee, Yool', 'Lee, Min Joo', 'Park, Eonyoung', 'Kang, Sung Hwan', 'Chung, Chin Ha', 'Lee, Kun Ho', 'Kim, Kyungjin']","['Lee J', 'Lee Y', 'Lee MJ', 'Park E', 'Kang SH', 'Chung CH', 'Lee KH', 'Kim K']","['School of Biological Sciences, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (ARNTL Transcription Factors)', '0 (ARNTL protein, human)', '0 (Arntl protein, mouse)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CLOCK Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CLOCK protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Clock protein, mouse)']",IM,"['ARNTL Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'CLOCK Proteins', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Circadian Rhythm', 'Dimerization', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitins/*metabolism']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00583-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00583-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Oct;28(19):6056-65. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00583-08.

MDR1 C3435T polymorphism influences the development of colon cancer and adult acute myeloid leukemia by the association with transporting carcinogen. The aim of this study was to clarify the association of MDR1 C3435T polymorphism with susceptibility to gastric cancer and peptic ulcers in patients with Japanese H. pylori infection. MAIN METHODS: We assessed the MDR1 C3435T polymorphism in H. pylori-positive gastritis alone patients (n=150), gastric cancer (n=292), gastric ulcer (n=215), and duodenal ulcer (n=163) and H. pylori-negative subjects (n=168) as control by a PCR-based method. KEY FINDINGS: No significant difference existed in frequencies of MDR1 C3435T polymorphisms between H. pylori-negative controls and H. pylori-positive gastritis alone patients. Moreover, MDR1-3435 T allele carriage didn't affect the risk of gastric cancer or peptic ulcer development. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of MDR1 3435 T allele carriers relative to the C/C genotype group for gastric cancer, gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer risk were 0.96 (95%CI: 0.56-1.66), 1.16 (95%CI: 0.72-1.84) and 1.00 (95%CI: 0.61-1.62), respectively. SIGNIFICANCE: In this preliminary data, the association with MDR1 C3435T polymorphism and risk for developing H. pylori-related gastric cancer and peptic ulcer in Japanese was low.

The question of how leukemic cells especially in monocytic lineage respond to GL-PS stimuli remains unclear. RESULTS: In this study, we used in vitro culture model with leukemic monocytic cell-lines THP-1 and U937 as monocytic effectors cells for proliferation responses and DCs induction. We treated the THP-1 and U937 cells with purified GL-PS (100 microg/mL) or GL-PS with GM-CSF/IL-4. GL-PS alone induced proliferative response on both THP-1 and U937 cells but only THP-1 transformed into typical DC morphology when stimulated with GL-PS plus GM-CSF/IL-4. The transformed THP-1 DCs had significant increase expression of HLA-DR, CD40, CD80 and CD86 though not as high as the extent of normal monocyte-derived DCs. They had similar antigen-uptake ability as the normal monocyte-derived DCs positive control. However, their potency in inducing allogeneic T cell proliferation was also less than that of normal monocyte-derived DCs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that GL-PS could induce selected monocytic leukemic cell differentiation into DCs with immuno-stimulatory function. The possible clinical impact of using this commonly used medicinal mushroom in patients with monocytic leukemia (AML-M4 and M5) deserved further investigation.","['Chan, Wing Keung', 'Cheung, Christopher Ching Hang', 'Law, Helen Ka Wai', 'Lau, Yu Lung', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung']","['Chan WK', 'Cheung CC', 'Law HK', 'Lau YL', 'Chan GC']","['Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, PR China. wingkc@graduate.hku.hk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Endocytosis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/immunology', 'Interleukin-12/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Polysaccharides/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Reishi/*chemistry', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology']",2008/07/23 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-9 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-9 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jul 21;1:9. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-9.,,,PMC2517069,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine whether PAX-5 expression is universal among B-cell malignancies. METHODS AND RESULTS: A wide spectrum of B-cell malignancies were subjected to immunohistochemical analysis for PAX-5 expression. The study was especially focused on cases lacking CD20, such as precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (preB-ALL), CD20- B-cell lymphomas, classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (CHL) and B-cell lymphomas with significant plasmacytic differentiation. Strong PAX-5 expression was identified, without exception, in all cases of CD20+ B-lymphoproliferative disorders. It was also invariably detected in 31/31 cases of preB-ALL, 14/14 cases of CD20- diffuse large B-cell lymphoma without plasmacytic differentiation and 26/26 CD20- B-cell lymphoma status post rituximab treatment. The vast majority of CHLs had unequivocal PAX-5 expression of varying intensity (80/86). However, variants of B-cell malignancies with characteristic plasmacytic differentiation exhibited no detectable PAX-5 expression (0/17). CONCLUSIONS: PAX-5 is the most sensitive and reliable immunohistochemical marker for B-cell malignancies.

At variance, down-modulation of Vav1 prevents ATRA-induced maturation, and in particular, the inhibition of its tyrosine phosphorylation prevents the neutrophil differentiation-related changes of cell morphology. These findings allowed to identify Vav1 as a crucial protein in the ATRA-dependent differentiation of tumoral promyelocytes. By means of a proteomic approach, here we have investigated a possible role for Vav1 in modulating protein expression during ATRA treatment of tumoral promyelocytes. We have performed high-resolution 2-DE coupled with mass spectra analysis of HL-60 and NB4 promyelocytic cell lines induced to differentiate with ATRA when the amounts or the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 were forcedly reduced. We have found that the down-regulation of Vav1 affects the expression level of a number of proteins, including cell cycle/apoptosis- and cytoskeleton-related proteins. In particular, the expression of 14-3-3epsilon, alpha-enolase, alpha-tubulin and splice isoform 2 of alpha3 proteasome subunit changed as a consequence of the down-modulation of Vav1 during the differentiation of both HL-60 and NB4 cell lines, suggesting that these proteins may constitute a common part of the ATRA-induced pathway during maturation of APL-derived promyelocytes.

This is an indication of serious gaps regardingthe nursing professional's function of providing assistance and educational support to the mother/caregiver within the family context.","['Klassmann, Jaciane', 'Kochla, Katia Renata Antunes', 'Furukawa, Tatiane Sano', 'Higarashi, Ieda Harumi', 'Marcon, Sonia Silva']","['Klassmann J', 'Kochla KR', 'Furukawa TS', 'Higarashi IH', 'Marcon SS']","['Departamento de Enfermagem da Pontificia Universidade Catolica do Parana-Campus Toledo, Londrina, PR, Brasil. jacianeklassmann@yahoo.com.br']",['por'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Brazil,Rev Esc Enferm USP,Revista da Escola de Enfermagem da U S P,0242726,,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Family Health', 'Female', '*Home Nursing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', '*Mothers']",2008/07/23 09:00,2008/10/18 09:00,['2008/07/23 09:00'],"['2008/07/23 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1590/s0080-62342008000200016 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Esc Enferm USP. 2008 Jun;42(2):321-30. doi: 10.1590/s0080-62342008000200016.,,,,,Experiencia de maes de criancas com leucemia: sentimentos acerca do cuidado domiciliar.,,,"['Rev Esc Enferm USP. 2008 Sep;42(3):600.

However, FC at standard doses may give hematological and non-hematological toxicity, predominantly in the elderly. Intravenous or oral low-dose FC regimens remain highly effective in elderly patients with Low-Grade Lymphomas other than CLL and are well tolerated. We tested efficacy and toxicity of oral FC at reduced doses in 26 elderly patients (median 71 years) with previously untreated (UT-CLL, n = 14) or relapsed/refractory CLL (R-CLL, n = 12), unfit for conventional treatments. Twentyfour-of-26 (92%) patients (14/14, 100% UT-CLL; 10/12, 83.5% R-CLL) obtained a response, with 12/26 (46%) complete responses (9/14, 64.2% in UT-CLL; 3/12, 25% in R-CLL). Non-hematological toxicity was mild and myelosuppression was documented in 8/26 (31%) patients (4/14, 28% UT-CLL; 4/12, 33% R-CLL). With a median follow-up of 24 months, median event-free survival was 48 months with no differences between UT-CLL and R-CLL and all responders were alive. Low-dose oral FC treatment showed good efficacy in both untreated and refractory/relapsed CLL. The treatment is useful in elderly patients who cannot benefit of more aggressive schedules and is easy to administer on an outpatient basis.","['Forconi, Francesco', 'Fabbri, Alberto', 'Lenoci, Mariapia', 'Sozzi, Elisa', 'Gozzetti, Alessandro', 'Tassi, Maristella', 'Raspadori, Donatella', 'Lauria, Francesco']","['Forconi F', 'Fabbri A', 'Lenoci M', 'Sozzi E', 'Gozzetti A', 'Tassi M', 'Raspadori D', 'Lauria F']","['Ematologia e Trapianti, Universita di Siena, AOUS, Italy. forconif@unisi.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",2008/07/22 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.868 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Dec;26(4):247-51. doi: 10.1002/hon.868.,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the feasibility of instead treating gated n-parameter clinical flow cytometry data as objects embedded in n-dimensional space using principles of information geometry via a recently described method known as Fisher Information Non-parametric Embedding (FINE). METHODS: After initial selection of relevant cell populations through an iterative gating strategy, we converted four color (six-parameter) clinical flow cytometry datasets into six-dimensional probability density functions, and calculated differences among these distributions using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (a measurement of relative distributional entropy shown to be an appropriate approximation of Fisher information distance in certain types of statistical manifolds). Neighborhood maps based on Kullback-Leibler divergences were projected onto two dimensional displays for comparison. RESULTS: These methods resulted in the effective unsupervised clustering of cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia from cases of expansion of physiologic B-cell precursors (hematogones) within a set of 54 patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment of flow cytometry datasets as objects embedded in high-dimensional space (as opposed to sequential two-dimensional analyses) harbors the potential for use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice or as a means for context-based archiving and searching of clinical flow cytometry data based on high-dimensional distribution patterns contained within stored list mode data. Additional studies will be needed to further test the effectiveness of this approach in clinical practice.","['Finn, William G', 'Carter, Kevin M', 'Raich, Raviv', 'Stoolman, Lloyd M', 'Hero, Alfred O']","['Finn WG', 'Carter KM', 'Raich R', 'Stoolman LM', 'Hero AO']","['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0602, USA. wgfinn@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080718,United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

SEPT9 is a very rare but recurrent fusion partner of MLL, and has recently been implicated in the oncogenesis of various malignancies. Herein, we report a case of de novo acute monocytic leukemia (M5b) with t(11;17)(q23;q25). MLL involvement was revealed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis, and an MLL/SEP9 fusion transcript was detected by RT-PCR. Sequencing analysis further showed that, in contrast to originally reported cases, MLL exon 8 was fused not with SEPT9 exon 3 but with exon 2, which codes for the unique N-terminal region of the SEPT9_v1 isoform, the region implicated in the regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. We did not detect any mutation of FLT3, which was expressed at a relatively low level in the leukemic cells. Relapsing after a very short complete remission, the leukemia progressed rapidly and became fatal in spite of intensive therapies including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is thus suggested that, in common with the original MLL/SEPT9 cases, monocytic differentiation and a poor prognosis may also be associated with acute myeloid leukemia with the variant MLL/SEPT9 fusion transcript.","['Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Tsuji, Kana', 'Ohki, Manabu', 'Miki, Tohru', 'Yamamoto, Masahide', 'Kakihana, Kazuhiko', 'Koyama, Takatoshi', 'Taniguchi, Shuichi', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Kurosu T', 'Tsuji K', 'Ohki M', 'Miki T', 'Yamamoto M', 'Kakihana K', 'Koyama T', 'Taniguchi S', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan. tkurosu.hema@tmd.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Laboratory Molecular Genetics of Hematology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Toranomon Hospital, 2-2-2 Toranomon, Minatoku, Tokyo, 105-8470, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyoku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080719,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Fatal Outcome', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Septins', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2008/07/22 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2007/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0133-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0133-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Sep;88(2):192-196. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0133-0.

We prospectively studied efficiency and tolerance of lonafarnib, a compound able to inhibit Ras signalling pathway through an inhibition of farnesyl transferase, in patients with MDS or secondary acute myeloid leukaemia (sAML). Lonafarnib was administered orally at a dose of 200 mg twice daily for three courses of 4 weeks (separated by 1 to 4 weeks without treatment). Sixteen patients were included: FAB/RAEB (n = 10), RAEB-T (n = 2), sAML (n = 2) and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML; n = 2); WHO/RAEB-1 (n = 4), RAEB-2 (n = 5), AML (n = 5), CMML (n = 2). Median age was 70 (53-77) years. The karyotype was complex or intermediate in 11 patients, and the International Prognostic Scoring Systems (IPSS) risk groups were low in two patients, INT-1 in one patient, INT-2 in four patients and high in six patients (unknown or not applicable in three patients). Among the 14 patients tested, five had Ras mutations in codons 12, 13 or 61 of N-Ras, K-Ras or H-Ras. One patient was excluded of the analysis for protocol violation, and 15 patients were assessable for tolerance. Gastrointestinal toxicities (diarrhoea, nausea and anorexia) and myelosuppression were the major side effects. Other toxicities included infections, fatigue, increase of liver enzymes, arrhythmia and skin rash. One patient died of infection, and the treatment was stopped in one other who developed atrial fibrillation. Doses were reduced in all but one patient treated with more than one course of farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Responses were assessable in 12 patients. A partial response in one sAML patient and a very transient decrease of blast cell count with normalisation of karyotype in one MDS patient were observed.

We studied 19 patients with acute lymphoblastic malignancy who underwent IL-2 treatment for a high probability of disease recurrence after allo-HSCT between July 2004 and June 2006 at Peking University Institute of Hematology. With a median follow-up of 6 months (range, 3-19 months) after the first IL-2 therapy, 14 of 15 evaluable patients in our cohort were disease-free (93.33%), whereas one patient in 'high risk' pretransplantation category relapsed. Toxicities from IL-2 were mainly fever, pain, redness and swelling at the injection site. Four patients left the study because of hyperpyrexia. Local and reversible chronic GVHD was observed in 6 of 15 patients (40%). Similar cGVHD occurrences were observed between the two groups of patients undergoing HLA-identical HSCT (three of seven patients) and HLA-haploidentical HSCT (two of six patients), respectively. In conclusion, low-dose IL-2 subcutaneous administration from 100 days for a prolonged period could be a safe and effective strategy to prevent relapse in acute lymphoblastic malignancy patients with high risk of recurrence after unmanipulated allo-HSCT.","['Liu, K-Y', 'Chen, Y-H', 'Liu, D-H', 'Xu, L-P', 'Huang, X-J']","['Liu KY', 'Chen YH', 'Liu DH', 'Xu LP', 'Huang XJ']","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (IL2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Male', 'Pilot Projects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*prevention & control/therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Young Adult']",2008/07/22 09:00,2009/03/11 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt2008208 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.208 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Oct;42(8):535-9. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.208.

In solid organ transplant, prevention of acute graft rejection correlates with achievement of target area under the whole blood concentration versus time curve during the 12-hour dosing interval (AUC-12) after oral administration. This study describes a limited sampling strategy for determination of cyclosporine AUC-12 after administration of the first intravenous (IV) dose in children undergoing HSCT and explores the relationships between individual whole blood concentrations during the dosing interval and the AUC. Children undergoing HSCT and receiving cyclosporine prophylaxis were eligible to participate. The first cyclosporine dose was given as a 2 hour infusion, and eight cyclosporine concentrations were determined at 2 (end of the infusion), 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after the start of the IV infusion. The relationship between AUC-12 and whole blood cyclosporine concentrations at individual time points after IV administration was assessed by the Spearman rho correlation coefficient. Limited sampling strategies were developed using three to six time points by way of multiple linear regression analysis. The agreement between the AUC-12 calculated using all eight data points and the limited sampling strategies was assessed by intraclass coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis. Twenty-four children (0.5-16.9 yr) participated. The mean AUC-12 calculated using all eight concentration versus time points was 2793 +/- 1165.6 microg/L.hr. Whole blood cyclosporine concentrations obtained within the first 4 hours from the start of the infusion correlated strongly with AUC-12 (Spearman rho coefficient, 0.717-0.868). Limited sampling strategies were developed to estimate AUC-12 with adjusted r2 of 0.955 to 0.998, mean bias of 0% to 0.93%, and precision of 1.6% to 8.1%. The actual AUC-12 and predicted AUC-12 values agreed strongly (intraclass coefficient, 0.981-0.999). Limited sampling strategies using three to six data points have been developed that will estimate cyclosporine AUC-12 after administration of the first IV dose given over 2 hours. Information regarding the possible association between aGvHD and cyclosporine AUC-12 is not available. The limited sampling strategies described here will facilitate the prospective evaluation of the clinical importance of cyclosporine AUC-12 in the prevention of aGvHD.","['Sibbald, Cathryn', 'Seto, Winnie', 'Taylor, Tracey', 'Saunders, E Fred', 'Doyle, John', 'Dupuis, L Lee']","['Sibbald C', 'Seto W', 'Taylor T', 'Saunders EF', 'Doyle J', 'Dupuis LL']","['Department of Pharmacy, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Ther Drug Monit,Therapeutic drug monitoring,7909660,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Area Under Curve', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporine/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Infant', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Regression Analysis']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FTD.0b013e318180c662 [doi]'],ppublish,Ther Drug Monit. 2008 Aug;30(4):434-8. doi: 10.1097/FTD.0b013e318180c662.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) inhibitors (such as azacytidine and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (such as trichostatin and valproic acid) efficiently induced apoptosis in the P39 MDS/AML cell line, correlating with an inhibition of NFkappaB (which translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm). This effect was obtained rapidly, within a few hours, suggesting that it was not due to epigenetic reprogramming. Indeed, DNMT and HDAC inhibitors reduced the phosphorylation of the NFkappaB-activating kinase IKKalpha/beta, and this effect was also observed in enucleated cells. Finally, circulating myeloblasts from AML patients treated with the DNMT inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine manifested a rapid (2 hours post-treatment) inhibition of NFkappaB and IKKalpha/beta. Altogether, these results indicate that DNMT and HDAC inhibitors can inhibit the constitutive activation of NFkappaB in malignant myeloblasts in vitro and in vivo through a novel mechanism.","['Fabre, Claire', 'Grosjean, Jennifer', 'Tailler, Maximilien', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Perfettini, Jean-Luc', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Fabre C', 'Grosjean J', 'Tailler M', 'Boehrer S', 'Ades L', 'Perfettini JL', 'de Botton S', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, U848, Unit Apoptosis, Cancer and Immunity, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080509,United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '614OI1Z5WI (Valproic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Valproic Acid/pharmacology']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['6268 [pii]', '10.4161/cc.7.14.6268 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2008 Jul 15;7(14):2139-45. doi: 10.4161/cc.7.14.6268.

We measured the effect of olive oil phenols on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2))-induced DNA damage in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL60) using single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Hydroxytyrosol [3,4-dyhydroxyphenyl-ethanol (3,4-DHPEA)] and a complex mixture of phenols extracted from both virgin olive oil (OO-PE) and olive mill wastewater (WW-PE) reduced the DNA damage at concentrations as low as 1 micromol/L when coincubated in the medium with H(2)O(2) (40 micromol/L). At 10 micromol/L 3,4-DHPEA, the protection was 93% in HL60 and 89% in PBMC. A similar protective activity was also shown by the dialdehydic form of elenoic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA) on both kinds of cells. Other purified compounds such as isomer of oleuropein aglycon (3,4-DHPEA-EA), oleuropein, tyrosol, [p-hydroxyphenyl-ethanol (p-HPEA)] the dialdehydic form of elenoic acid linked to tyrosol, caffeic acid, and verbascoside also protected the cells against H(2)O(2)-induced DNA damage although with a lower efficacy (range of protection, 25-75%). On the other hand, when tested in a model system in which the oxidative stress was induced by phorbole 12-myristate 13-acetate-activated monocytes, p-HPEA was more effective than 3,4-DHPEA in preventing the oxidative DNA damage. Overall, these results suggest that OO-PE and WW-PE may efficiently prevent the initiation step of carcinogenesis in vivo, because the concentrations effective against the oxidative DNA damage could be easily reached with normal intake of olive oil.","['Fabiani, Roberto', 'Rosignoli, Patrizia', 'De Bartolomeo, Angelo', 'Fuccelli, Raffaela', 'Servili, Maurizio', 'Montedoro, Gian Francesco', 'Morozzi, Guido']","['Fabiani R', 'Rosignoli P', 'De Bartolomeo A', 'Fuccelli R', 'Servili M', 'Montedoro GF', 'Morozzi G']","['Dipartimento di Specialita Medico-Chirurgiche e Sanita Pubblica, Sezione di Epidemiologia Molecolare ed Igiene Ambientale, Universita degli Studi di Perugia, 06126 Perugia, Italy. fabirob@unipg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Nutr,The Journal of nutrition,0404243,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Olive Oil)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '10597-60-1 (3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'ML9LGA7468 (Phenylethyl Alcohol)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Olea/chemistry', 'Olive Oil', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Phenols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phenylethyl Alcohol/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Plant Oils/chemistry/*pharmacology']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['138/8/1411 [pii]', '10.1093/jn/138.8.1411 [doi]']",ppublish,J Nutr. 2008 Aug;138(8):1411-6. doi: 10.1093/jn/138.8.1411.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCR-ABL transcript levels decline over several years of imatinib treatment, and increasing numbers of patients have BCR-ABL transcripts at or below the limit of detection. More sensitive PCR methods are required to assess whether these patients have a long-term continuing decline in residual disease. METHODS: We used random pentadecamer (R15) primers for reverse transcription in RQ-PCR and compared the results with our established method that uses random hexamers. An increase in assay sensitivity would be detected as an increase in the number of BCR-ABL transcripts. RESULTS: BCR-ABL transcripts increased by 86% with R15 primers. We used R15 primers to retest 19 samples from selected CML patients who had no BCR-ABL transcripts recently detectable with hexamer primers and detected BCR-ABL transcripts in 68% of the samples. Use of R15 primers showed variable increases in the transcripts for control genes BCR (breakpoint cluster region), ABL1 (c-abl oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase), and GUSB (glucuronidase, beta), depending on the gene examined. The reported BCR-ABL/control gene ratio was affected, and the estimated detection limit of the assay, which was based on increased control gene copy number, was different for each control gene. CONCLUSIONS: This simple modification to the reverse transcription methodology improved the detection limit of the RQ-PCR assay for BCR-ABL transcripts. In the field of CML, these results have important implications for defining the detection limit of an assay when the BCR-ABL transcript is undetectable. Random pentadecamer primers may also be useful in other reverse transcription PCR assays for which the abundance of the target RNA is low.","['Ross, David M', 'Watkins, Dale B', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'Branford, Susan']","['Ross DM', 'Watkins DB', 'Hughes TP', 'Branford S']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical & Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. ross@imvs.sa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080718,England,Clin Chem,Clinical chemistry,9421549,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['DNA Primers/*analysis/*genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['clinchem.2008.105916 [pii]', '10.1373/clinchem.2008.105916 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Chem. 2008 Sep;54(9):1568-71. doi: 10.1373/clinchem.2008.105916.

We conducted a nationwide survey in Japan and collected 185 evaluable patients. Fourteen patients with large granular lymphocyte leukemia-associated pure red cell aplasia were evaluated. Cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A and prednisolone produced remissions in 6/8, 1/4 and 0/2 patients respectively. Seven and 5 patients were maintained on cyclophosphamide or cyclosporine A respectively. Two patients relapsed after stopping cyclophosphamide, and 2 patients relapsed during maintenance therapy with cyclosporine A.

Eight novel and 5 known mutations were identified. All predicted novel proteins shared the last five amino acids VSLRK with the similar gain of nuclear exporting signal motif as known variants. Older age, high white blood cell and platelet counts, normal cytogenetics, and CD34-negativity were associated with NPM1 mutation. FLT3 mutation was more frequent in mutant NPM1 than wild-type cases (56.8% vs. 25.6%) whereas RAS and AML1 mutations were rarely found. Overall survival analysis based on the NPM1/FLT3 mutational status revealed a better outcome for the NPM1-positive/FLT3-negative subgroup. We conclude that: i) NPM1 mutation represents a common genetic hallmark in Southeast Asian acute myeloid leukemia with a normal karyotype; ii) NPM1 mutants coexisted mainly with FLT3 mutants, but not RAS or AML1; iii) FLT3 mutation had a negative prognostic impact on patients with mutant NPM1.","['Boonthimat, Chetsada', 'Thongnoppakhun, Wanna', 'Auewarakul, Chirayu U']","['Boonthimat C', 'Thongnoppakhun W', 'Auewarakul CU']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080718,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Asians/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics/*metabolism']",2008/07/22 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.12937 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.12937 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Oct;93(10):1565-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.12937.

The impact of these advances on long-term survival on the population level should be disclosed as timely as possible. We estimated trends in age specific 5- and 10-year relative survival of chronic myelocytic leukemia patients in the United States from 1990-1992 to 2002-2004.

Period analysis was used to disclose recent developments with minimum delay. Overall, 5-year relative survival increased from 27 to 49%, and 10-year relative survival increased from 9.5 to 34% between 1990-92 and 2002-04. The increase was most dramatic for younger patients, with 10-year relative survival increasing from 16 to 72% in age group 15-44 years, from 12 to 54% in age group 45-54 years, and from 8 to 34% in age group 55-64 years (p<0.0001 in all cases). Improvements were more modest and not statistically significant, and survival remained at much lower levels among age groups 65-74 and 75+ years. Our analysis discloses a dramatic recent increase in long-term survival of younger patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia which most likely reflects rapid dissemination of advances in therapy on the population level.","['Brenner, Hermann', 'Gondos, Adam', 'Pulte, Dianne']","['Brenner H', 'Gondos A', 'Pulte D']","['Division of Clinical Epidemiology & Aging Reseach, German Cancer Research Center, Bergheimer Strasse 20, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany. h.brenner@dkfz-heidelberg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080718,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/22 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13045 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13045 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Oct;93(10):1544-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13045.

We hypothesized that PTPN11 mutations promote cell-cycle progression and confer enhanced survival to hematopoietic progenitors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Murine bone marrow low-density mononuclear cells were transduced with pMIEG3, pMIEG3-WT Shp2, pMIEG3-Shp2D61Y, or pMIEG3-Shp2E76K followed by cell-cycle and survival functional analysis as well as biochemical analysis for key cell-cycle and programmed cell-death regulatory proteins. RESULTS: A higher proportion of hematopoietic progenitors bearing the gain-of-function Shp2 mutants were residing in the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle in response to low doses of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor compared to cells transduced with empty vector (MIEG3) or with WT Shp2. Likewise, Shp2D61Y- or Shp2E76K-expressing hematopoietic cells demonstrated reduced apoptosis based on Annexin-V staining and produced increased progenitor colonies after 48 hours in minimal media compared to cells transduced with empty vector or WT Shp2. To differentiate enhanced survival vs hyperproliferation, cells were stained with PKH26 to distinguish undivided cells from divided progeny. Shp2D61Y- or Shp2E76K-expressing PKH26+ cells similarly demonstrated reduced apoptosis. Upon biochemical analysis, expression of Akt- and Erk-responsive cell-cycle and programmed cell-death regulatory proteins were altered, including increased levels of cyclin D1, Bcl2, and BclXL and reduced levels of p27, p21, and Bim. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data demonstrate that gain-of-function Shp2 mutants promote hematopoietic progenitor cell-cycle progression and survival and imply that agents targeting the cell cycle or promoting apoptosis may have therapeutic potential in JMML.","['Yang, Zhenyun', 'Li, Yiping', 'Yin, Fuqin', 'Chan, Rebecca J']","['Yang Z', 'Li Y', 'Yin F', 'Chan RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080721,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Cyclins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Ptpn11 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/physiology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/*physiology', 'Child', 'Cyclins/genetics/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/*genetics/physiology']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2007/11/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00205-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1285-96. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.016.

Here, we analyzed the role of Mucin1 in human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells as well as in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mucin1 expression was determined within the normal stem cell and progenitor compartment, as well as in the AML CD34+ and CD34- subfractions of patient samples. Stem cells were enumerated in long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) assays in limiting dilution and progenitor frequencies in colony-forming cell (CFC) assays in methylcellulose, and consequences of elevated Mucin1 expression were studied using retroviral overexpression systems in cord blood (CB) CD34+ cells. RESULTS: Ten percent of CB and 5% of peripheral blood CD34+ cells expressed Mucin1. Retroviral overexpression of Mucin1 in CB CD34+ cells resulted in elevated stem cell and progenitor frequencies as determined in LTC-IC and CFC assays without affecting differentiation, which coincided with increased proliferation. Overexpression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, a ligand for Mucin1, in MS5 stromal cells further increased LTC-IC frequencies. Mucin1 overexpression was associated with increased nuclear factor-kappaB p50 nuclear translocation, suggesting that Mucin1-induced phenotypes involve increased cell survival mechanisms. Finally, we observed increased Mucin1 expression in 70% of the AML cases (n=24), suggesting that elevated Mucin1 levels might be involved in regulating the proliferative potential of the immature leukemic compartment as well. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that hematopoietic stem cells as well as CD34+ AML subfractions are enriched for Mucin1 expression, and that overexpression of Mucin1 in CB cells is sufficient to increase both progenitor and LTC-IC frequencies.","['Fatrai, Szabolcs', 'Schepers, Hein', 'Tadema, Henko', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'Daenen, Simon M G J', 'Schuringa, Jan Jacob']","['Fatrai S', 'Schepers H', 'Tadema H', 'Vellenga E', 'Daenen SM', 'Schuringa JJ']","['Department of Hematology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080721,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (MUC1 protein, human)', '0 (Mucin-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA Primers', 'Fetal Blood/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mucin-1/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00204-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1254-65. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.015.

Thymoglobulin (TG) was added to methotexate (MTX) and cyclosporine (CsA) as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. For low-risk (acute leukemia CR1/CR2, CML CP1) patients projected 5-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and overall survival (OS) were 4% and 76% for those <or=45 years old (n = 54) and 6% and 83% for those >45 (n = 31). For high-risk (HR) patients NRM was 6% versus 27% (18% at 1 year) (P = .04) and OS 64% versus 37% (P = .47) in younger (n = 40) and older (n = 75) patients, respectively. To correct for imbalance in HR diagnoses each of 17 younger HR patients were matched with 2 older HR (OHR) patients by diagnosis and details of stage, and thereafter for other risk factors. For the younger HR and OHR patients, respectively, OS was 70% versus 37% (P = .02) and NRM 0 versus 34% (P = .02). When outcomes of OHR patients were compared with the other 3 groups combined NRM was 27% versus 5%, respectively (P = .002). Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) grade II-IV, aGVHD grade III-IV, and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 23% versus 10% (P = .02), 4% versus 2% (P = ns), and 66% versus 41% (P = .001), respectively. Nine of 14 nonrelapse deaths in the OHR group were related to GVHD or its treatment compared with 3 of 6 in all others (P value for GVHD related death = .01). Multivariate analysis of OS and DFS correcting for potentially confounding pretransplant factors identified only the OHR patients as having significantly increased risk (relative risk [RR] 3.32, confidence interval [CI] 1.71-6.47, P < .0001, and RR 3.32, CI 1.71-6.43, P < .0001, respectively). The effect of age on NRM is only apparent in HR patients, and is not explained by heterogeneity in diagnoses. Older HR patients experience more GVHD and more GVHD-related death than others, but NRM is no higher than reported with many nonmyeloablative regimens.","['Russell, James A', 'Duan, Qiuli', 'Chaudhry, M Ahsan', 'Savoie, Mary Lynn', 'Balogh, Alexander', 'Turner, A Robert', 'Larratt, Loree', 'Storek, Jan', 'Bahlis, Nizar J', 'Brown, Christopher B', 'Quinlan, Diana', 'Geddes, Michelle', 'Zacarias, Nancy', 'Daly, Andrew', 'Duggan, Peter', 'Stewart, Douglas A']","['Russell JA', 'Duan Q', 'Chaudhry MA', 'Savoie ML', 'Balogh A', 'Turner AR', 'Larratt L', 'Storek J', 'Bahlis NJ', 'Brown CB', 'Quinlan D', 'Geddes M', 'Zacarias N', 'Daly A', 'Duggan P', 'Stewart DA']","['Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Medicine, Foothills Hospital, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. jamesrus@cancerboard.ab.ca']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'D7RD81HE4W (thymoglobulin)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality/pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods/mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage', 'Risk Assessment', 'Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1083-8791(08)00220-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.05.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2008 Aug;14(8):888-95. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2008.05.010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To fill this knowledge gap we performed a retrospective analysis of patients with graft failure over a 10-year time period in a single institution. Cases were included for analysis if they had failed to achieve an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 500/microL or more by 28 days post-SCT or 42 days after cord blood transplantation (primary graft failure); had a decrease in their ANC to <500/mL for 3 consecutive days after having achieved neutrophil engraftment (secondary graft failure); or failed to have evidence of at least 5% or more donor cell engraftment (primary graft failure with autologous reconstitution). Among 1726 patients who underwent allografts from January 1, 1990, through December 31, 2000, we identified 68 patients with graft failure. The 1-, 2-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) for all patients was 31%, 24%, and 15%. A diagnosis of acute leukemia was a significant predictor for poor survival on multivariate analysis. We conclude that graft failure is an uncommon complication postallogeneic SCT, and is associated with poor outcomes.

However, neurogenesis precedes gliogenesis, which normally commences at later stages of fetal telencephalic development. Astrocyte differentiation of mouse NPCs at embryonic day (E) 14.5 (relatively late gestation) is induced by activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, whereas at E11.5 (mid-gestation) NPCs do not differentiate into astrocytes even when stimulated by STAT3-activating cytokines such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This can be explained in part by the fact that astrocyte-specific gene promoters are highly methylated in NPCs at E11.5, but other mechanisms are also likely to play a role. We therefore sought to identify genes involved in the inhibition of astrocyte differentiation of NPCs at midgestation. We first examined gene expression profiles in E11.5 and E14.5 NPCs, using Affymetrix GeneChip analysis, applying the Percellome method to normalize gene expression level. We then conducted in situ hybridization analysis for selected genes found to be highly expressed in NPCs at midgestation. Among these genes, we found that N-myc and high mobility group AT-hook 2 (Hmga2) were highly expressed in the E11.5 but not the E14.5 ventricular zone of mouse brain, where NPCs reside. Transduction of N-myc and Hmga2 by retroviruses into E14.5 NPCs, which normally differentiate into astrocytes in response to LIF, resulted in suppression of astrocyte differentiation. However, sustained expression of N-myc and Hmga2 in E11.5 NPCs failed to maintain the hypermethylated status of an astrocyte-specific gene promoter. Taken together, our data suggest that astrocyte differentiation of NPCs is regulated not only by DNA methylation but also by genes whose expression is controlled spatio-temporally during brain development.","['Sanosaka, T', 'Namihira, M', 'Asano, H', 'Kohyama, J', 'Aisaki, K', 'Igarashi, K', 'Kanno, J', 'Nakashima, K']","['Sanosaka T', 'Namihira M', 'Asano H', 'Kohyama J', 'Aisaki K', 'Igarashi K', 'Kanno J', 'Nakashima K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Neuroscience, Graduate School of Biological Sciences, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5, Takayama, Ikoma, Nara 630-0101, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080621,United States,Neuroscience,Neuroscience,7605074,"['0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling/methods', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'HMGA2 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/methods', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0306-4522(08)00908-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.06.039 [doi]']",ppublish,Neuroscience. 2008 Aug 26;155(3):780-8. doi: 10.1016/j.neuroscience.2008.06.039.

We describe here the case of a patient who developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia five years after the patient had received adjuvant radiochemotherapy because of breast cancer. This therapy comprised 4 cycles epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, a mitoxantrone-based high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplantation and a subsequent radiation. Cytogenetic bone marrow analysis revealed a translocation t(11;14)(q23;q32), with a MLL split signal in FISH analysis. By applying a long-distance inverse PCR method the KIAA0284 gene was identified as translocation partner. Both breakpoints, on chromosomes 11 and 14, were characterized. The breakpoint in the KIAA0284 gene was located 5' of the putative start codon and an in-frame MLL-KIAA0284 transcript was detectable by RT-PCR. The KIAA0284 gene has hitherto not been implicated in hematologic diseases and has never been reported as a translocation partner. Its physiological function is unknown.

Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified by conventional cytogenetic analysis, which is now widely recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic determinants in AML. METHOD: Conventional cytogenetic analysis was done on 200 de novo AML subjects. RESULTS: Of these, 176 (88%) were successfully karyotyped and 24 (12%) showed culture failure. Among the 176 subjects, 101 (57.4%) were abnormal and 75 (42.6%) showed an apparently normal karyotype. The various aberrations observed were t(8;21)(q22;q22) (5.2%); t(15;17) (q22;q11-21) (9%); t(9;22)(q34;q11)(1.7%); t(14;17)(q32;q11.2)(0.5%); inv(16)(p13;q22)(1.7%); 11q23 rearrangements (4%); monosomy 7 (2.2%) and 22 (1.1%); deletion of 9q (q22q34) (5.1%), 5q (q13q33) (0.5%) and 13q (q13q31) (0.5%); common trisomies like +8 (5.6%), +16 (1.7%), +22 (1.1%), +21 (0.5%), +13 (0.5%), +11 (0.5%), +3 (0.5%); hyperdiploidy (3.4%); hypodiploidy (1.1%); complex karyotype (4%); and other structural abnormalities (4.5%). Apart from these, three novel chromosomal abnormalities viz. t(8;18), t(7;14), t(13;15) were observed in the current study population. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities varies considerably. Comparatively, the incidence t(15;17), and del9q is higher, while that of -5/del5q, -7/del7q and inv (16) were lower in our population. Similarly, the frequency of other recurrent FAB associated abnormalities viz. 11qabn was comparable to previous reports. Furthermore, ongoing cytogenetic studies are warranted in larger groups of AML cases to identify newly acquired chromosomal aberrations that may aid in cloning novel genes involved in the neoplastic process, ultimately helping in the development of targeted therapeutic drugs.","['Ahmad, Firoz', 'Dalvi, Rupa', 'Das, Bibhu Ranjan', 'Mandava, Swarna']","['Ahmad F', 'Dalvi R', 'Das BR', 'Mandava S']","['Research and Development, SRL Ranbaxy Ltd., 17th Street, MIDC, Andheri (E), Mumbai 400093, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080718,England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0361-090X(08)00064-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cdp.2008.05.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 2008;32(2):168-77. doi: 10.1016/j.cdp.2008.05.007.

However, the mechanism by which streptochlorin functions is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic effect of streptochlorin in human leukemic U937 cells. Streptochlorin treatment resulted in concentration- and time-dependent growth inhibition by inducing apoptosis. The increase in apoptosis that was induced by streptochlorin was correlated with down-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression, up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and FasL, a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), activation of caspases and degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose)polymerase and phospholipase C-gamma1 protein. In addition, the cytotoxic effects and apoptotic characteristics induced by streptochlorin were significantly inhibited by z-DEVD-fmk, a caspase-3 inhibitor, which demonstrates the important role that caspase-3 played in the process. Furthermore, Bcl-2 overexpression significantly reversed the streptochlorin-induced growth inhibitory effects via inhibition of the MMP collapse and caspases activation and effectively attenuated the apoptotic response to streptochlorin. However, the elevated levels of FasL expression induced by streptochlorin were not reduced by Bcl-2 overexpression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the pro-apoptotic effect of streptochlorin is mediated through activation of caspases and mitochondria in U937 cells.","['Park, Cheol', 'Shin, Hee Jae', 'Kim, Gi-Young', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu', 'Nam, Taek-Jeong', 'Kim, Se-Kwon', 'Cheong, Jaehun', 'Choi, Il-Whan', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Park C', 'Shin HJ', 'Kim GY', 'Kwon TK', 'Nam TJ', 'Kim SK', 'Cheong J', 'Choi IW', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongeui University College of Oriental Medicine, Department of Biomaterial Control (BK21 Program), Dongeui University Graduate School, Yangjung-dong San 45, Busanjin-gu, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080701,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Oxazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (streptochlorin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/drug effects/metabolism', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Fas Ligand Protein/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Oxazoles/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Streptomyces/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00167-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.06.010 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Sep;22(6):1573-81. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.06.010.

In contrast, during chronic inflammatory stress additional factors are involved in regulating adrenal function. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine that increases ACTH release from the pituitary. In addition, LIF and LIF receptors (LIFR) are expressed in the human adrenal cortex and the human adrenocortical tumor cell line H295R. Furthermore, LIF increases basal and ACTH-stimulated cortisol release from H295R cells. However, the expression of LIF and LIFR in non-human adrenal glands and the effects of LIF on the release of cortisol from adrenal cells of non-human species have not been determined. Furthermore, the effects of LIF on adrenal androgen release from all species are unknown. In this study, immunohistochemistry, Western blots, RT-PCR, and nucleotide sequencing was utilized to demonstrate that LIF and its receptor are expressed throughout the bovine adrenal cortex. Although LIF did not modify basal cortisol release from dispersed cells isolated from the bovine adrenal zona fasciculate, this cytokine increased ACTH-stimulated release of cortisol from these cells in a manner dependent on the LIF concentration and exposure interval. In contrast, LIF in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner decreased basal and ACTH-stimulated adrenal androgen release from dispersed cells isolated from the bovine adrenal zona reticularis. Because LIF release increases during inflammatory stress and this cytokine stimulates adrenal cortisol release and inhibits adrenal androgen release, this cytokine may play an important role in regulating the release of adrenal steroids during inflammatory stress.","['Woods, Alison M', 'McIlmoil, Christopher J', 'Rankin, Ernestina N', 'Packer, Alissa A', 'Stevens, Jessica C', 'Macievic, Jeffrey A', 'Brown, Aaron B', 'Porter, James P', 'Judd, Allan M']","['Woods AM', 'McIlmoil CJ', 'Rankin EN', 'Packer AA', 'Stevens JC', 'Macievic JA', 'Brown AB', 'Porter JP', 'Judd AM']","['Department of Physiology and Developmental Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT 84602, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080626,United States,Domest Anim Endocrinol,Domestic animal endocrinology,8505191,"['0 (Androgens)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex/*metabolism', 'Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/physiology', 'Androgens/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Cattle/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Hydrocortisone/*metabolism', 'Immunohistochemistry/veterinary', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/18 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0739-7240(08)00060-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.domaniend.2008.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Domest Anim Endocrinol. 2008 Aug;35(2):217-30. doi: 10.1016/j.domaniend.2008.05.005.

OZ was found, by both biochemical and mass spectrometry-based approaches, to target Trx1 and TrxR in a cell-free system. In particular, the formation of reversible OZ adducts to Trx1 Cys35, Cys62, and Cys73 was demonstrated. We next showed that OZ efficiently inhibited Trx and TrxR catalytic activity in Molt4 cells. The occurrence of oxidative modifications of Trx molecules was assessed by ""redox Western blot"" analyses. OZ-mediated Trx oxidation resulted in apoptosis signaling kinase-1 release and activation of downstream JNK and p38 pathways. By means of specific inhibitors of these two stress-activated protein kinases, we demonstrated that the JNK pathway plays a major role in determining the apoptotic fate of OZ-exposed cells, whereas p38 activation seems to be involved mainly in OZ-induced G2/M block.","['Nigro, Patrizia', 'Dal Piaz, Fabrizio', 'Gallotta, Dario', 'De Tommasi, Nunziatina', 'Belisario, Maria Antonietta']","['Nigro P', 'Dal Piaz F', 'Gallotta D', 'De Tommasi N', 'Belisario MA']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmaceutiche, Universita di Salerno, Via Ponte Don Melillo, 84084 Fisciano, Salerno, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080624,United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,"['0 (13-hydroxy-15-oxozoapatlin)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell-Free System', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Thioredoxins/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0891-5849(08)00368-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.06.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2008 Sep 15;45(6):875-84. doi: 10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.06.015.

One STAT family member, STAT5, is often constitutively active in myeloid leukaemia. Agents that can suppress STAT5 activation have potential for prevention and treatment of cancer. N'-(11H-indolo[3,2-c]quinolin-6-yl)-N,N-dimethylethane-1,2-dia-mine (IQDMA), an indoloquinoline derivative, synthesized in our laboratory, has been demonstrated to be an effective anti-tumor agent in human leukemia cells. In the present report, we tested IQDMA for its ability to suppress STAT5 activation. We found that IQDMA inhibited constitutive activation of STAT5 in HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The activation of Src and interleukin-6 (IL-6), implicated in STAT5 activation, was also inhibited by the IQDMA. Furthermore, IQDMA up-regulated Bax, and down-regulated Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), cyclin D1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) as followed by growth arrest of HL-60 cells, but the expression of survivin did not change in the presence of IQDMA. Taken together, these results indicate that IQDMA causes significant induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells via down-regulation of Src, IL-6, and STAT5 signaling and modulation of Bcl-2 family, cyclin D1 and VEGF proteins. Thus, IQDMA appears to be a potential therapeutic agent for treating leukaemia HL-60 cells.","['Chien, Ching-Ming', 'Yang, Sheng-Huei', 'Lin, Kuei-Li', 'Chen, Yeh-Long', 'Chang, Long-Sen', 'Lin, Shinne-Ren']","['Chien CM', 'Yang SH', 'Lin KL', 'Chen YL', 'Chang LS', 'Lin SR']","['Faculty of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung 807, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080628,Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', ""0 (N'-(11H-indolo(3,2-c)quinolin-6-yl)-N,N-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine)"", '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (SOCS1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src))', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins pp60(c-src)/metabolism', 'Quinolines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2008/07/22 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0009-2797(08)00344-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2008.06.008 [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 2008 Oct 22;176(1):40-7. doi: 10.1016/j.cbi.2008.06.008.

The Ph results in the formation of the BCR/ABL1 fusion gene, which is a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase. Around 1% of CML patients appear to have a Ph negative karyotype but carry a cryptic BCR/ABL1 fusion that can be located by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) at chromosome 22q11, 9q34 or a third chromosome. Here we present FISH mapping data of BCR and ABL1 flanking regions and associated chromosomal rearrangements in 9 Ph negative BCR/ABL1 positive CML patients plus the cell line CML-T1. RESULTS: BCR/ABL1 was located at 9q34 in 3 patients, 22q11 in 5 patients and CML-T1 and 22p11 in 1 patient. In 3 of 6 cases with the fusion at 22q11 a distal breakpoint cluster was found within a 280 Kb region containing the RAPGEF1 gene, while in another patient and the CML-T1 the distal breakpoint fell within a single BAC clone containing the 3' RXRA gene. Two cases had a duplication of the masked Ph while genomic deletions of the flanking regions were identified in 3 cases. Even more complex rearrangements were found in 3 further cases. CONCLUSION: BCR/ABL1 formation resulted from a direct insertion (one step mechanism) in 6 patients and CML-T1, while in 3 patients the fusion gene originated from a sequence of rearrangements (multiple steps). The presence of different rearrangements of both 9q34 and 22q11 regions highlights the genetic heterogeneity of this subgroup of CML. Future studies should be performed to confirm the presence of true breakpoint hot spots and assess their implications in Ph negative BCR/ABL1 positive CML.","['Virgili, Anna', 'Brazma, Diana', 'Reid, Alistair G', 'Howard-Reeves, Julie', 'Valganon, Mikel', 'Chanalaris, Anastasios', 'De Melo, Valeria As', 'Marin, David', 'Apperley, Jane F', 'Grace, Colin', 'Nacheva, Ellie P']","['Virgili A', 'Brazma D', 'Reid AG', 'Howard-Reeves J', 'Valganon M', 'Chanalaris A', 'De Melo VA', 'Marin D', 'Apperley JF', 'Grace C', 'Nacheva EP']","['Molecular Cytogenetics, Academic Haematology, Royal Free and UCL Medical School, Rowland Hill Street, London, NW3 2PF, UK. e.nacheva@ucl.ac.uk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080718,England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,2008/07/22 09:00,2008/07/22 09:01,['2008/07/22 09:00'],"['2008/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/22 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/22 09:00 [entrez]']","['1755-8166-1-14 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8166-1-14 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2008 Jul 18;1:14. doi: 10.1186/1755-8166-1-14.,,,PMC2500019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The inability to isolate a reliably efficacious and homogeneous population of early progenitor cells has limited efforts to increase their therapeutic potential. In this study, we focused on identifying protein markers that may be employed to predict the efficacy of a cultured BMSC population. Markers of progenitor status were identified by comparing BMSCs at early and late passage, donor-matched skin fibroblasts, and commercially available dermal fibroblast cell lines. Differentiation potential was determined according to in vitro assays of osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis. Early-passage BMSCs differentiated into all three lineages, whereas late-passage BMSCs and both fibroblast preparations did not. To identify novel markers of early progenitors, microarray transcript analysis between early-passage BMSCs and fibroblasts was performed. Messenger RNA encoding the cytokine leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was identified as differentially expressed. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay on conditioned media confirmed that LIF secretion was much higher from early progenitor BMSCs than donor-matched or commercial lines of fibroblasts and dropped with extensive expansion or induction of differentiation. In clonally expanded BMSCs, colonies that retained progenitor status expressed significantly higher levels of LIF than those that failed to differentiate. Our results indicate that LIF expression may represent a marker to quantify the differentiation potential of BMSCs and may be especially suited for the rapid, noninvasive quality control of clinical preparations.","['Whitney, Mandolin J', 'Lee, Andy', 'Ylostalo, Joni', 'Zeitouni, Suzanne', 'Tucker, Alan', 'Gregory, Carl A']","['Whitney MJ', 'Lee A', 'Ylostalo J', 'Zeitouni S', 'Tucker A', 'Gregory CA']","['Center for Gene Therapy, Tulane University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tissue Eng Part A,Tissue engineering.

We have investigated the activity of gefitinib in haematological tumour cells, in particular acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). METHODS: Cytotoxic activity of gefitinib, alone or in combination with standard anti-leukaemic drugs, was assessed by the short-term fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay in tumour cells from 117 patients representing five haematological and five non-haematological malignancies. In AML, the EGFR status was analysed by immunochemistry. Gefitinib-induced apoptosis was investigated in a subset of AML samples, as well as in the leukaemia cell line MV-4-11, using a multiparametric high content screening assay. To confirm activation of caspase-3 in cells treated with gefitinib, a blocking test was carried out in which MV4-11 cells were pretreated with the specific caspase inhibitor DEVD-FMK. RESULTS: Gefitinib showed highest cytotoxic activity in AML (n = 19) with many samples being sensitive at concentrations achievable in clinical practice (<10 microM), and no difference between previously untreated and relapsed patients. No correlation between the activity of gefitinib and standard antileukaemic drugs (cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide) was observed. Combining gefitinib with these drugs resulted in mainly additive or synergistic (etoposide) effects, with no evidence of sequence dependency. The AML cells did not express the EGFR. Gefitinib induced apoptosis, which was at least partly mediated by activation of the caspase-3 pathway. CONCLUSION: In vitro, gefitinib has significant cytotoxic activity in AML by inducing apoptosis through non-EGFR dependent pathways.","['Lindhagen, Elin', 'Eriksson, Anna', 'Wickstrom, Malin', 'Danielsson, Katarina', 'Grundmark, Birgitta', 'Henriksson, Roger', 'Nygren, Peter', 'Aleskog, Anna', 'Larsson, Rolf', 'Hoglund, Martin']","['Lindhagen E', 'Eriksson A', 'Wickstrom M', 'Danielsson K', 'Grundmark B', 'Henriksson R', 'Nygren P', 'Aleskog A', 'Larsson R', 'Hoglund M']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quinazolines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1120 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01120.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Nov;81(5):344-53. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01120.x.

They primarily occur during the first course of induction chemotherapy and may increase the risk of leukaemia relapse, due to a significant delay in consolidation therapy. The intensification of induction chemotherapy and the use of non-conventional drugs such as fludarabine are considered responsible for the increased risk of infections. METHODS: In this study, we retrospectively analysed the infections occurred in 224 newly diagnosed AML patients </=65 yr, consecutively treated between 1997 and 2002 with an induction regimen including fludarabine, arabinosyl cytosine and idarubicin, with or without etoposide (FLAI/FLAIE), in the context of three multicentric prospective trials (AML97, AML99, AML02). RESULTS: During the induction phase, 146 (65%) patients experienced fever of undetermined origin (FUO), 30 (13%) and 47 (21%) patients had Gram-negative and positive bacteremias, respectively, and 10 (4%) patients developed a probable/proven invasive fungal infection (IFI). The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 10%, 8% and 60% respectively. During consolidation, 75 (35%) patients had FUO, 43 (20%) and 40 (19%) patients had Gram-negative and positive bacteremias, respectively, and 5 (2%) patients developed a probable/proven IFI. The fatality rate for Gram-negative, Gram-positive bacteremias and probable/proven IFI was 14%, 5% and 80% respectively. Interestingly, the overall incidence of microbiologically documented infections during induction was 38% and the incidence of probable/proven IFIs during the induction/consolidation programme was 7%. No infections caused by viruses or opportunistic pathogens were observed neither during induction, nor during consolidation. CONCLUSIONS: These data, although retrospectively collected, suggest that fludarabine-based chemotherapy is not associated with an increased incidence of infections, in particular IFIs, compared to conventional regimens commonly used for AML induction.","['Malagola, Michele', 'Peli, Annalisa', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'De Rosa, Francesco', 'Lauria, Francesco', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Gobbi, Marco', 'Pierri, Ivana', 'Zaccaria, Alfonso', 'Zuffa, Eliana', 'Mazza, Patrizio', 'Priccolo, Giancarla', 'Gugliotta, Luigi', 'Bonini, Alessandro', 'Visani, Giuseppe', 'Skert, Cristina', 'Bergonzi, Cesare', 'Roccaro, Aldo Maria', 'Fili, Carla', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Baccarani, Michele', 'Russo, Domenico']","['Malagola M', 'Peli A', 'Damiani D', 'Candoni A', 'Tiribelli M', 'Martinelli G', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Paolini S', 'De Rosa F', 'Lauria F', 'Bocchia M', 'Gobbi M', 'Pierri I', 'Zaccaria A', 'Zuffa E', 'Mazza P', 'Priccolo G', 'Gugliotta L', 'Bonini A', 'Visani G', 'Skert C', 'Bergonzi C', 'Roccaro AM', 'Fili C', 'Fanin R', 'Baccarani M', 'Russo D']","['Unit of Blood Diseases and Cell Therapies, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy. michelemalagola@yahoo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080819,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/chemically induced/mortality', 'Female', 'Fever/chemically induced/mortality', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1122 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01122.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Nov;81(5):354-63. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01122.x.

External validation of the WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and comparison with IPSS.,364-73,10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01124.x [doi],"BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to evaluate the prognostic value of the WHO Classification-Based Prognostic Scoring System (WPSS) and to compare it with that of the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: 149 patients de novo diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome between December 1994 and February 2007, were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: WPSS presented an excellent method for risk-stratifying patients into five subgroups, with different risks of death and leukaemic evolution. On univariate analysis, three components of WPSS - cytogenetic risk, WHO category and transfusion dependency - had good correlations with overall survival (OS) and time to leukaemic evolution (TTL). However, one component of IPSS - number of peripheral cytopenias - did not correlate with OS or TTL. WPSS could distinguish the truly low-risk patients (very low) who had an excellent long-term survival with rare leukaemic evolution, while IPSS could not. These patients should be managed with clinical observation and delayed treatment strategies. Furthermore, on multivariate analysis for OS, WPSS was found to be an independent prognostic factor for survival along with age [P = 0.04; hazard ratio (HR) = 1.71; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-2.85] and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (P = 0.002; HR = 2.47; 95% CI 1.41-4.31). On the other hand, the prognostic significance of IPSS was not confirmed. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the WPSS might be a more powerful predictor of prognosis than IPSS and that independent validation of several other, larger data sets should be necessary.","['Park, Min Jae', 'Kim, Hee-Jin', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Kim, Dong Hwan', 'Kim, Seok Jin', 'Jang, Jun Ho', 'Kim, Kihyun', 'Kim, Won Seog', 'Jung, Chul Won']","['Park MJ', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim SH', 'Kim DH', 'Kim SJ', 'Jang JH', 'Kim K', 'Kim WS', 'Jung CW']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080710,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification/complications/*diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*World Health Organization']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1124 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01124.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Nov;81(5):364-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01124.x.

However, the feedback regulation of differentiation-dependent ESC self-renewal is poorly understood. Retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, plays a critical role in ESC differentiation and embryogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrate that short-term treatment of murine (m) ESCs with RA during the early differentiation stage prevented spontaneous differentiation of mESCs. The RA-treated cells maintained self-renewal capacity and could differentiate into neuronal cells, cardiomyocytes, and visceral endoderm cells derived from three germ layers. The differentiation-inhibitory effect of RA was mimicked by conditioned medium from RA-treated ESCs and was accompanied with up-regulated expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), Wnt3a, Wnt5a, and Wnt6. Such RA-induced prevention of ESC differentiation was attenuated by a neutralizing antibody against LIF or by a specific Wnt antagonist Fz8-Fc and was totally reversed in the presence of both of them. Furthermore, knock-down of beta-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, by small interfering RNA counteracted the effect of RA. In addition, RA treatment enhanced expression of endodermal markers GATA4 and AFP but inhibited expression of primitive ectodermal marker Fgf-5 and mesodermal marker Brachyury. These findings reveal a novel role of RA in ESC self-renewal and provide new insight into the regulatory mechanism of differentiation-dependent self-renewal of ESCs, in which Wnt proteins and LIF induced by RA have the synergistic action. The short-term treatment of ESCs with RA also offers a unique model system for study of the regulatory mechanism that controls self-renewal and specific germ-layer differentiation of ESCs.","['Wang, Rong', 'Liang, Ji', 'Yu, Hui-Mei', 'Liang, He', 'Shi, Yi-Jun', 'Yang, Huang-Tian']","['Wang R', 'Liang J', 'Yu HM', 'Liang H', 'Shi YJ', 'Yang HT']","['Laboratory of Molecular Cardiology, Institute of Health Sciences, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences (SIBS), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTUSM), Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080701,England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Keratolytic Agents)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Keratolytic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Mesoderm/cytology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Wnt Proteins/metabolism', 'beta Catenin/metabolism']",2008/07/19 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60031-1 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00272.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2008 Nov;76(9):931-45. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00272.x.

However, S. cerevisiae has unexpectedly high water permeability, implying that this yeast may contain water channels in the membrane.","['de Maranon, I M', 'Gervais, P', 'Molin, P']","['de Maranon IM', 'Gervais P', 'Molin P']","['Laboratoire de Genie des Procedes Alimentaires et Biotechnologiques, ENSBANA, 1 Esplanade Erasme, 21000 Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,,,2008/07/19 09:00,2008/07/19 09:01,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19971005)56:1<62::AID-BIT7>3.0.CO;2-T [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1997 Oct 5;56(1):62-70. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19971005)56:1<62::AID-BIT7>3.0.CO;2-T.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we investigated the association among these three features in APL-derived NB4 cells. We found that NADPH oxidase-derived ROS generation was more abundant in NB4 cells compared with monocytic leukemia U937 cells. By using PR9, a sub-line of U937 stably transduced with the inducible PML/RARalpha expression vectors, we attributed disparities on ROS generation and ATO sensitivity to the occurrence of PML/RARalpha fusion protein, since PML/RARalpha-expressing cells appeared higher NADPH oxidase activity, higher ROS level and higher sensitivity to ATO. On the other hand, the basal intensity of cAMP signaling pathway was compared between NB4 and U937 as well as between PR9 cells with or without PML/RARalpha, demonstrating that PML/RARalpha-expressing cells had an impaired cAMP signaling pathway which relieved its inhibitory effect on NADPH oxidase derived ROS generation. In summary, the present study demonstrated the correlation of PML/RARalpha with cAMP signaling pathway, NADPH oxidase and ROS generation in APL cells. PML/RARalpha that bestows NB4 cells various pathological features, paradoxically also endows these cells with the basis for susceptibility to ATO-induced cytotoxcity.","['Li, Lingna', 'Wang, Jie', 'Ye, Richard D', 'Shi, Guiying', 'Jin, Huifang', 'Tang, Xueming', 'Yi, Jing']","['Li L', 'Wang J', 'Ye RD', 'Shi G', 'Jin H', 'Tang X', 'Yi J']","['Department of Cell Biology, Key Laboratory of The Education Ministry for Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis, Institutes of Medical Sciencies, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclic AMP/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'NADPH Oxidases/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.21523 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2008 Nov;217(2):486-93. doi: 10.1002/jcp.21523.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,,,,,

Compelling research indicates that flavonoids have important roles in cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy possibly due to biological activities that include action through anti-inflammation, free radical scavenging, modulation of survival/proliferation pathways, and inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Plant polyphenols including the green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate or (-)-EGCG, and the flavonoids apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, and chrysin have been shown to inhibit proteasome activity and induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells. However, biotransformation reactions to the reactive hydroxyl groups on polyphenols could reduce their biological activities. Although methylated polyphenols have been suggested to be metabolically more stable than unmethylated polyphenols, the practical use of methylated polyphenols as cancer preventative agents warrants further investigation. In the current study, methylated and unmethylated flavonoids were studied for their proteasome-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing abilities in human leukemia HL60 cells. Methylated flavonoids displayed sustained bioavailability and inhibited cellular proliferation by arresting cells in the G(1) phase. However, they did not act as proteasome inhibitors in either an in vitro system or an in silico model and only weakly induced apoptosis. In contrast, unmethylated flavonoids exhibited inhibition of the proteasomal activity in intact HL60 cells, accumulating proteasome target proteins and inducing caspase activation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. We conclude that methylated flavonoids lack potent cytotoxicity against human leukemia cells and most likely have limited ability as chemopreventive agents.","['Landis-Piwowar, Kristin R', 'Milacic, Vesna', 'Dou, Q Ping']","['Landis-Piwowar KR', 'Milacic V', 'Dou QP']","['Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Flavonoids)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Diet', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2008/07/19 09:00,2009/01/06 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.21853 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2008 Oct 1;105(2):514-23. doi: 10.1002/jcb.21853.,,"['R03 CA112625-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1R01CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120009-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA120009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R03CA112625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA112625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2574743,['NIHMS65862'],,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Malnutrition may be present at diagnosis due to the effects of the malignancy or, in low income countries (LIC), due to poverty and an inadequate diet. PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of malnutrition at diagnosis in children with cancer in Morocco. PROCEDURE: Nutritional status of 100 children aged less than 18 years with newly diagnosed malignancy between January 2005 and January 2006 was evaluated by anthropometric and biochemical parameters before initiating therapy. We measured weight, height, weight-for-height using z-scores index for children and body mass index for adolescents, triceps skinfold thickness and mid-upper arm circumference, and serum albumin. RESULTS: A total of 100 patients were included. The mean age was 7 years (range 1 to 18 years). Sixty percent were boys. The diagnosis was: Burkitt lymphoma (n = 19), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (n = 18), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (n = 14), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 13), Ewing sarcoma (n = 7), nephroblastoma (n = 6), Hodgkin disease (n = 5), osteosarcoma (n = 5), retinoblastoma (n = 4), neuroblastoma (n = 3), germ cell tumor (n = 3), orbital lymphoma (n = 1), cerebral lymphoma (n = 1), ependymoma (n = 1). Incidence of malnutrition ranged from 20 to 50%, depending upon the measurement used. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of malnutrition in this study was high, so interventions are being implemented to improve the nutritional status of these patients.","['Tazi, Illias', 'Hidane, Zakia', 'Zafad, Saadia', 'Harif, Mhamed', 'Benchekroun, Said', 'Ribeiro, Raul']","['Tazi I', 'Hidane Z', 'Zafad S', 'Harif M', 'Benchekroun S', 'Ribeiro R']","['Hematology and Pediatric Oncology Department, Hopital, 20 Aout 1953, Casablanca, Morocco. tazi_illias@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Morocco/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology/metabolism', '*Nutritional Status']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21689 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Oct;51(4):495-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21689.,,['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4684256,['NIHMS65883'],,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

In eight out of seventeen patients, in the first two injections, irradiated leukemic cells were mixed with bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) to improve the efficacy of therapy by additional induction of innate immunity. A hematological improvement (as defined by a >25% reduction of leukocyte count) to autologous leukemic cell vaccines was observed in 5/17 patients, stabilisation of disease in 5/17 patients and in 7/17 patients there was no response to immunotherapy. In seven patients significant increase of the lymphocyte doubling time was noted (p=0.02). There was no impact of BCG for immune responses or clinical outcome of vaccinated patients, but there was a significant increase of the absolute counts of CD3+ as well as of CD3+/CD4+ and CD3+/CD8+ T cells during the vaccination period. We observed a significant improvement of the phagocytic function of autologous dendritic cells generated from peripheral blood monocytes obtained from patients with B-CLL after the end of immunotherapy (p=0.006). An association between the clinical outcome and the percentage of leukemic cells positive for expression of ZAP-70 and CD38 was noted. In conclusion, our results demonstrated the feasibility and safety of autologous irradiated leukemic cell immunotherapy in patients with B-CLL.

Uncovering RA target genes is of considerable interest in APL. This study comprehensively examines in APL cells transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the novel candidate RA target gene, G0S2, the G0/G1 switch gene. Reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and heteronuclear PCR assays performed +/- treatment with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) revealed G0S2 induction within 3 h of RA-treatment. Treatment with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D did not implicate G0S2 transcript stabilization in the RA-mediated increase of G0S2 mRNA expression. Promoter elements of G0S2 were cloned into a reporter plasmid and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) co-transfection assays confirmed transcriptional activation after RA-treatment. Consistent with G0S2 being a direct RA target gene, retinoic acid response element (RARE) half-sites were found in this promoter. Mutation of these sites blocked RA-transcriptional activation of G0S2. To extend analyses to the protein expression level, a polyclonal anti-G0S2 antibody was derived and detected murine and human G0S2 species. G0S2 protein was rapidly induced in cultured NB4-S1 human APL cells and in APL transgenic mice treated with RA. An RAR pan-antagonist confirmed dependence on RARs for this induction. That these findings are clinically relevant was shown by analyses of APL cells derived directly from patients. These leukemic cells induced both a prominent increase in the cellular differentiation marker nitrotetrazolium blue (NBT) staining and marked increase in G0S2 expression. Taken together, these findings indicate G0S2 is an RA target gene. The functional role of G0S2 in retinoid response of APL warrants further study.","['Kitareewan, Sutisak', 'Blumen, Steven', 'Sekula, David', 'Bissonnette, Reid P', 'Lamph, William W', 'Cui, Qingping', 'Gallagher, Robert', 'Dmitrovsky, Ethan']","['Kitareewan S', 'Blumen S', 'Sekula D', 'Bissonnette RP', 'Lamph WW', 'Cui Q', 'Gallagher R', 'Dmitrovsky E']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (G0S2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Vitamin D Response Element/drug effects/physiology']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Aug;33(2):397-404.,,"['R01 CA062275-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA087546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-12/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA062275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-06A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111422-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111422-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA111422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-10S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111422-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA56771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA00959/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087546-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111422-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-09/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA062275-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-16/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA056771-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2597086,['NIHMS79437'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 40% of the B-ALL patients expressed B203.13. In these patients, B203.13 was constantly co-expressed with CD10, but never co-expressed with CD20, contrary to the controls. The CD10(+)/B203.13(+) phenotype was specific to B-ALL, since CD10(+)/CD20(+) cells from common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (c-ALL) did not express B203.13. We concluded that the use of B203.13 in association with CD10 and CD20 provides meaningful information for distinguishing normal residual B-cells from leukemic B-lymphoblasts and that recurrence of a CD10(+)/B203.13(+) phenotype after transplantation may be a very early relapse indicator of early B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Gobbi, Giuliana', 'Mirandola, Prisco', 'Malinverno, Chiara', 'Sponzilli, Ivonne', 'Carubbi, Cecilia', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Binazzi, Roberto', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Giuliani-Piccari, Gabriella', 'Ramazzotti, Giulia', 'Pasquantonio, Guido', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Vitale, Marco']","['Gobbi G', 'Mirandola P', 'Malinverno C', 'Sponzilli I', 'Carubbi C', 'Ricci F', 'Binazzi R', 'Basso G', 'Giuliani-Piccari G', 'Ramazzotti G', 'Pasquantonio G', 'Cocco L', 'Vitale M']","['Department of Anatomy, Pharmacology and Forensic Medicine, Human Anatomy Section, University of Parma, Ospedale Maggiore, I-43100 Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD20/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neprilysin/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Aug;33(2):371-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the role of central karyotype review in maintaining accurate, high quality cytogenetic data for clinical and translational studies using two criteria: the proportion of karyotypes rejected (i.e. inadequate), and, among accepted (i.e. adequate) cases, the proportion of karyotypes whose interpretation was changed on central karyotype review. We compared the first four years during which central karyotype review was performed with a recent 4-year period and found that the proportion of rejected samples decreased significantly for both AML and ALL. However, during the latter period, central karyotype reviews still found 8% of AML and 16% of ALL karyotypes inadequate. Among adequate cases, the karyotype was revised in 26% of both AML and ALL samples. Some revisions resulted in changing the patients' assignment to particular World Health Organization diagnostic categories and/or moving patients from one prognostic group to another. Overall, when both data on rejection rates and data on karyotype revisions made in accepted cases were considered together, 32% of AML and 38% of ALL samples submitted were either rejected or revised on central karyotype review during the recent 4-year period. These data underscore the necessity of continued central karyotype review in multi-institutional cooperative group studies.","['Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Rao, Kathleen W', 'Patil, Shivanand R', 'Pettenati, Mark J', 'Watson, Michael S', 'Arthur, Diane C', 'Tantravahi, Ramana', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Koduru, Prasad R K', 'Block, Annemarie W', 'Qumsiyeh, Mazin B', 'Edwards, Colin G', 'Sterling, Lisa J', 'Holland, Kelsi B', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Mrozek K', 'Carroll AJ', 'Maharry K', 'Rao KW', 'Patil SR', 'Pettenati MJ', 'Watson MS', 'Arthur DC', 'Tantravahi R', 'Heerema NA', 'Koduru PR', 'Block AW', 'Qumsiyeh MB', 'Edwards CG', 'Sterling LJ', 'Holland KB', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Arthur G.

Pediatric orbit tumors and tumorlike lesions: osseous lesions of the orbit.,1193-214,10.1148/rg.284085013 [doi],"Many extraocular masses involving the pediatric orbit have an osseous origin. The most common is the dermoid inclusion cyst; these cystic lesions may contain lipid and are most often found near the zygomaticofrontal suture, adjacent to an indolent-appearing erosion of bone. Some primary bone lesions may involve the orbit, producing a lytic or dense lesion with enlargement of the bone; these lesions include fibrous dysplasia, juvenile ossifying fibroma, and osteosarcoma. Fibrous dysplasia tends to produce a mass of ground-glass appearance with longitudinal osseous expansion, whereas juvenile ossifying fibroma is likely to produce a mixed lytic and sclerotic lesion and focal osseous enlargement. Osteosarcoma causes marked bone destruction and variable osteoid production. Langerhans cell histiocytosis, an idiopathic reticuloendothelial proliferative disorder, tends to involve the bones of the skull, especially the lateral orbital roof; it produces lytic destruction of bone with a sclerotic rim and a large intraorbital soft-tissue mass. Granulocytic sarcoma is a solid tumor that may occur in children with myelogenous leukemia. These tumors tend to arise in the subperiosteum of the lateral orbital wall, although they usually do not disrupt the bone. Finally, the orbit is a common site for bone metastases from neuroblastoma, which cause aggressive periosteal reaction in the orbital roof or lateral wall. The last three conditions are often bilateral. At imaging evaluation, osseous lesions may appear similar to each other and to nonosseous masses of the orbit. Knowledge of the pathologic features of these tumors and how these features are reflected in their imaging appearances may help radiologists differentiate them.","['Chung, Ellen M', 'Murphey, Mark D', 'Specht, Charles S', 'Cube, Regino', 'Smirniotopoulos, James G']","['Chung EM', 'Murphey MD', 'Specht CS', 'Cube R', 'Smirniotopoulos JG']","['Department of Radiology, F.

One of the most important genetic factor, often associated with increased susceptibility to fractures and lower bone mass, is the polymorphism of the gene of collagen type I alpha 1 (COLIA1). Significant ethnic differences were found in the distribution of specific COLIA1 genotypes. Comorbidity of potentially unfavourable genotype and childhood cancer and its' treatment could enhance its' negative influence on bone. THE AIM OF THE STUDY was to evaluate the frequency of collagen type I alpha 1 gene polymorphism in children from the north-eastern region of Poland, who underwent cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The COLIA1 gene polymorphism was established by RFLP (restricted fragment length polymorphism) method using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 215 patients (89 girls and 126 boys) treated for cancer at the Department of Pediatric Oncology of Medical University of Bialystok. Control group consisted of 51 healthy children from the same region of Poland. RESULTS: In the group of children with neoplastic disease we found the following distribution of COLIA genotypes: SS - 66,5%, Ss - 33,02% and ss - 0,47%. In the control group the SS genotype was more frequent (80,95%). In children treated for leukemia allel 's' was found to be more frequent (SS - 58%, Ss - 41%). CONCLUSIONS: It seems that presence of 's' allel, which was proved to be concomitant with fractures occurrence in adults, should be also considered as an additional negative element of the bone structure in children, especially when other environmental factors are present (complex antineoplastic treatment, bone marrow infiltration and cancer itself). Genetic factors, such as polymorphism of collagen type I, should be taken under consideration in diseases which can potentially lead to osteoporosis.","['Sawicka-Zukowska, Malgorzata', 'Muszynska-Roslan, Katarzyna', 'Krawczuk-Rybak, Maryna', 'Galicka, Anna', 'Panasiuk, Anna']","['Sawicka-Zukowska M', 'Muszynska-Roslan K', 'Krawczuk-Rybak M', 'Galicka A', 'Panasiuk A']","['Akademia Medyczna w Bialymstoku, Klinika Onkologii Dzieciecej.']",['pol'],['Journal Article'],,Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,"['0 (COL1A1 protein, human)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Collagen Type I/*genetics', 'Collagen Type I, alpha 1 Chain', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Osteoporosis/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Poland', '*Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length']",2008/07/19 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/07/19 09:00'],"['2008/07/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2008 Mar;24(141):237-40.,,,,,Czestosc wystepowania polimorfizmu genu kolagenu typu I (COLIA1) u mlodziezy i dzieci z regionu polnocno-wschodniej Polski chorujacych na chorobe nowotworowa.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall median survival of this cohort was 9.5 months, shorter than reported in earlier series. The least favorable outcomes are associated with complex cytogenetics, lack of any normal metaphases, normocytic rather than macrocytic erythrocyte indices, and low baseline lymphocyte counts. Lymphopenia but not neutropenia at the time of diagnosis appears to be a new adverse prognostic indicator. Cytogenetic breakpoints defined by G-banded karyotyping correlate poorly with particular disease features. Surprisingly, survival of patients with treatment-related MDS was equivalent to that of de novo MDS with del(5q) in this series. Morphologic features associated with del(5q) are diverse. Most patients with del(5q) MDS do not meet criteria for WHO-defined 5q-syndrome, and the presence of del(5q) does not appear to modify the clinical phenotype otherwise risk-stratified by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). Additional important prognostic factors not taken into account by the IPSS include the baseline erythrocyte indices, lymphocyte count, and clonal burden.","['Holtan, Shernan G', 'Santana-Davila, Rafael', 'Dewald, Gordon W', 'Khetterling, Rhett P', 'Knudson, Ryan A', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Chen, Dong', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Porrata, Luis', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Steensma, David P']","['Holtan SG', 'Santana-Davila R', 'Dewald GW', 'Khetterling RP', 'Knudson RA', 'Hoyer JD', 'Chen D', 'Hanson CA', 'Porrata L', 'Tefferi A', 'Steensma DP']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Breakage', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Erythrocyte Indices', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minnesota/epidemiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21245 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Sep;83(9):708-13. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21245.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

CC and RT-PCR for fusion genes BCR/ABL, MLL/AF4, E2A/PBX1, TEL/AML1 were performed at diagnosis in each patient. FISH was performed to verify the presence of fusion genes and MLL rearrangements and to estimate the percentage of abnormal cells. Karyotypes were obtained in 59 (84%) of 70 cases. Thirty-five (59%) of 59 cases revealed chromosome aberrations. Hyperdiploidy>50 chromosomes was present in nine cases, hyperdiploidy 47-50 chromosomes in six, pseudodiploidy in 15, and hypodiploidy in five. BCR/ABL was present in two cases, PBX1/E2A in two, and TEL/AML1 in 14. MLL/AF4 was not found, but the rearrangements of MLL gene were present in five children. The addition of RT-PCR and FISH to CC was of the utmost importance. One of two Ph translocations and one of two t(1;19) were first revealed by RT-PCR. Moreover, FISH showed the percentage of TEL/AML1(+) cells that turned to be an important prognostic factor. The outcome was the best for the children with hyperdiploidy>50 chromosomes without structural changes. It was also good for those with TEL/AML1 present in >or=80% of cells without chromosome aberrations. The presence of pseudodiploidy correlated with poor outcome.

Bcl-2 can locate as an integral mitochondrial membrane component, where its primary role is to block apoptosis by maintaining membrane integrity. Here we show that Bcl-2 also can position on the outer cell surface membrane of B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and certain other leukemias that do not classically possess the chromosomal breakpoint t(14;18). Although low levels of Bcl-2 can be detected on the surface membrane of apparently healthy leukemic and normal B cells, expression of Bcl-2 correlates best with spontaneous or induced apoptosis. Notably, upon induction of apoptosis, B-CLL cells were much more efficient in upregulating surface Bcl-2 than normal B cells. It is not clear if this surface membrane expression is a passive consequence of the apoptotic process or an active attempt by the B cell to abort cell death by stabilizing the plasma membrane.","['McCarthy, Brian A', 'Boyle, Erin', 'Wang, Xue Ping', 'Guzowski, Dorothy', 'Paul, Santanu', 'Catera, Rosa', 'Trott, Joshua', 'Yan, Xiao-jie', 'Croce, Carlo M', 'Damle, Rajendra', 'Yancopoulos, Sophia', 'Messmer, Bradley T', 'Lesser, Martin', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas']","['McCarthy BA', 'Boyle E', 'Wang XP', 'Guzowski D', 'Paul S', 'Catera R', 'Trott J', 'Yan XJ', 'Croce CM', 'Damle R', 'Yancopoulos S', 'Messmer BT', 'Lesser M', 'Allen SL', 'Rai KR', 'Chiorazzi N']","['Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/05/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.2119/2008.00061.McCarthy [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Med. 2008 Sep-Oct;14(9-10):618-27. doi: 10.2119/2008.00061.McCarthy.,,"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2464573,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we prospectively evaluated sCD23 doubling time (sCD23DT) as a prognostic factor for time to treatment (TTT) and OS in 56 newly diagnosed and untreated CLL patients at Binet stage A, and compared it to the most commonly used biological prognostic factors: lymphocyte doubling time, immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgVH) mutational status and zeta-associated protein-70 (ZAP-70), CD38, and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression. In patients with sCD23DT <1 year, the median TTT and OS were 20 and 83 months compared to 141 and 177 months in patients with sCD23DT >1 year (P<0.0001). Among patients with poor prognostic factors (ZAP-70+, LPL+ and CD38+), an sCD23DT <1 year identified a subpopulation with a shorter TTT. Patients with unmutated IgVH and an sCD23DT <1 year had a median TTT and OS of 14 and 83 months, respectively, whereas these values were 70 and >177 months when sCD23DT was >1 year (P<0.0001 and P=0.0219, respectively). Finally, in a Cox multivariate analysis, sCD23DT was the sole independent prognostic factor for TTT (P=0.0027). Furthermore, sCD23DT refines the prognosis given by other classical prognostic factors. These observations support the introduction of sCD23 evaluation into the routine assessment of CLL patients.","['Meuleman, N', 'Stamatopoulos, B', 'Dejeneffe, M', 'El Housni, H', 'Lagneaux, L', 'Bron, D']","['Meuleman N', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Dejeneffe M', 'El Housni H', 'Lagneaux L', 'Bron D']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080717,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/analysis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Receptors, IgE/*blood', 'Time Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/analysis']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008190 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.190 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Oct;22(10):1882-90. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.190.

To dissect immunological mechanisms responsible for immune tolerance toward leukemia, we established a murine model system allowing clonotypic analysis of leukemia-specific CD4 T cells recognizing ovalbumin (OVA). Upon i.v. injection of genetically engineered leukemia cells, dendritic cells (DCs) engulfed, processed and presented OVA to OVA-specific CD4 T cells. Consequently, leukemia-specific T cells were primed in vivo as shown by expression of activation markers and proliferative responses. However, in spite of detectable CD4 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo, no effective anti-leukemia immunity was established. In contrast, adoptively transferred DO11.10 T cells that were primed ex vivo mediated effective antitumor immunity. Furthermore, ex vivo primed DO11.10 T cells showed high expression of Th1 cytokines (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-2) whereas in vivo primed OVA-specific CD4 T cells showed incomplete differentiation (proliferation without cytokine production). We conclude that activated T cells lacking effector function develop through incomplete differentiation in leukemia-bearing mice. Thus, priming conditions of leukemia-specific CD4 T cells critically determines the balance between immunity or tolerance toward leukemia.","['Hegazy, A N', 'Klein, C']","['Hegazy AN', 'Klein C']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080717,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity/immunology', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovalbumin/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/immunology', 'Th1 Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008193 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.193 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Nov;22(11):2070-9. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.193.

However, other cancers do not respond well to this form of arsenic at clinically achievable doses. We tested a novel arsenical, S-dimethylarsino-glutathione (darinaparsin) for efficacy in various malignancies in vitro. Darinaparsin is significantly more potent than As(2)O(3) at mediating apoptosis in various malignant cell lines and is highly active against APL cells derived for As(2)O(3) resistance. We provide evidence that darinaparsin triggers apoptosis by inducing signaling pathways that do not completely overlap with As(2)O(3). We show that darinaparsin induces apoptosis and oxidative stress to a greater extent than As(2)O(3), although like As(2)O(3), darinaparsin-induced toxicity is c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase-dependent. However, darinaparsin does not induce promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML/RAR alpha) degradation or rearrange PML nuclear bodies in APL cells, nor is its toxicity increased by glutathione depletion. Darinaparsin treatment results in higher intracellular arsenic accumulation when compared to As(2)O(3) treatment. This may be explained by our finding that As(2)O(3), but not darinaparsin, is efficiently exported by ABCC1, suggesting increased therapeutic efficacy of darinaparsin in ABCC1-overexpressing tumors. Our studies indicate that darinaparsin efficiently kills tumor cells with increased antioxidant capacity and drug exporters and suggest that darinaparsin may have a broader therapeutic spectrum than As(2)O(3).","['Diaz, Z', 'Mann, K K', 'Marcoux, S', 'Kourelis, M', 'Colombo, M', 'Komarnitsky, P B', 'Miller, W H Jr']","['Diaz Z', 'Mann KK', 'Marcoux S', 'Kourelis M', 'Colombo M', 'Komarnitsky PB', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Department of Oncology, Segal Cancer Comprehensive Center, Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B.

However, it remains largely unknown whether the viability of cells exposed to Aurora kinase inhibitors depends on the p53 status. We investigated the interaction of Aurora kinases and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockades using a small-molecule pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor, MK-0457, and a selective small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, Nutlin-3. We found that MK-0457, which itself activates p53 signaling, acts synergistically with Nutlin-3 to induce apoptosis in wild-type p53 AML cell lines OCI-AML-3 and MOLM-13 but not in p53-null HL-60 cells. MK-0457 and Nutlin-3 showed synergism in inducing p53, conformational change of Bax and Deltapsi(m) loss, suggesting an involvement of p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis. Nutlin-3 constrained endoreduplication after Aurora inhibition via activation of a p53-dependent postmitotic checkpoint and p21 induction in pseudo-G1 cells.

Although CLL cells are sensitive in vitro to bortezomib-induced apoptosis when cultured in medium, the killing activity was blocked when cultured in 50% fresh autologous plasma. Dietary flavonoids, quercetin and myricetin, which are abundant in plasma, inhibited bortezomib-induced apoptosis of primary CLL and malignant B-cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was associated with chemical reactions between quercetin and the boronic acid group, -RB(OH)2, in bortezomib. The addition of boric acid diminished the inhibitory effect of both quercetin and plasma on bortezomib-induced apoptosis. The protective effect was also reduced when myeloma cell lines, but not B-cell lines, were preincubated with quercetin, indicating a direct effect of quercetin on myeloma cells. At high doses, quercetin itself induced tumor cell death. These data indicate that dietary flavonoids limit the efficacy of bortezomib, whereas supplemental inorganic boric acid is able to reverse this. The complex interactions between quercetin, tumor cells, and bortezomib mean caution is required when giving dietary advice to patients.","['Liu, Feng-Ting', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Movasaghi, Zanyar', 'Wyatt, Peter B', 'Rehman, Ihtesham U', 'Gribben, John G', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Jia, Li']","['Liu FT', 'Agrawal SG', 'Movasaghi Z', 'Wyatt PB', 'Rehman IU', 'Gribben JG', 'Newland AC', 'Jia L']","['Centre for Haematology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080716,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Boric Acids)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'R57ZHV85D4 (boric acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Boric Acids/pharmacology', 'Boronic Acids/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Diet/adverse effects', 'Flavonoids/*adverse effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diet therapy/drug therapy/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diet therapy/drug therapy/pathology', 'Multiple Myeloma/diet therapy/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazines/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Quercetin/adverse effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51944-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-150227 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 1;112(9):3835-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-04-150227.

MN1 is a cofactor of retinoic acid receptor/retinoic x receptor (RAR/RXR)-mediated transcription and this study identified genes in the promonocytic cell line U937 that were regulated by MN1. We found that MN1 can both stimulate and inhibit transcription. Combining MN1 expression with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the ligand of the RAR/RXR dimer, showed that MN1 could both enhance and repress ATRA effects. Many of the identified genes are key players in hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis (e.g. MEIS1 and BMI1). Another interesting target is DHRS9. DHRS9 is involved in the synthesis of ATRA from vitamin A. MN1 inhibited DHRS9 expression and completely abolished its induction by ATRA. MN1 is also the target of a rare AML-causing translocation encoding the MN1-TEL protein. MN1-TEL induces expression of only a few genes and its most pronounced effect is inhibition of a large group of ATRA-induced genes including DHRS9. In conclusion, both MN1 and MN1-TEL interfere with the ATRA pathway and this might explain the differentiation block in leukemias in which these genes are involved.","['Meester-Smoor, Magda A', 'Janssen, Marjolein J F W', 'Grosveld, Gerard C', 'de Klein, Annelies', 'van IJcken, Wilfred F J', 'Douben, Hannie', 'Zwarthoff, Ellen C']","['Meester-Smoor MA', 'Janssen MJ', 'Grosveld GC', 'de Klein A', 'van IJcken WF', 'Douben H', 'Zwarthoff EC']","['Department of Pathology, Josephine Nefkens Institute, Erasmus MC, PO Box 2040, 3000 CA Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080716,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (MN1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Retinoid X Receptors/*physiology', 'Trans-Activators', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['bgn168 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgn168 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2008 Oct;29(10):2025-34. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgn168.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients now enrolled include those with severe congenital neutropenia (n = 526), cyclic neutropenia (n = 205), idiopathic neutropenia (n = 349), autoimmune neutropenia (n = 68), and other (n = 15). More than 90% (1053 of 1163) of patients in the SCNIR have been treated with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), median dose 3.33 mug/kg per day. RESULTS: Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has reduced the occurrence of infection, hospitalization, and antibiotics and improved patients' quality of life. Most patients have noted few adverse effects with G-CSF treatment. Osteoporosis/osteopenia has been reported in 14% of all patients, and myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelocytic leukemia have occurred in 57 patients, including severe congenital neutropenia (11.8%; 50 of 422), Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (8.1%; 3 of 37), and 4 others. The SCNIR is an important resource for studies on the genetic and molecular basis for the disorders causing chronic neutropenia. CONCLUSION: The findings of mutations in the gene for neutrophil elastase as causing cyclic and congenital neutropenia, the role of mutations in the gene for the G-CSF receptor in the evolution of severe congenital neutropenia to acute myelocytic leukemia, and the importance of apoptosis as the cellular mechanism for several diseases causing severe chronic neutropenia have come from studies on these patients.","['Dale, David C', 'Bolyard, Audrey Anna', 'Schwinzer, Beate G', 'Pracht, Gusal', 'Bonilla, Mary Ann', 'Boxer, Laurence', 'Freedman, Melvin H', 'Donadieu, Jean', 'Kannourakis, George', 'Alter, Blanche P', 'Cham, Bonnie P', 'Winkelstein, Jerry', 'Kinsey, Sally E', 'Zeidler, Cornelia', 'Welte, Karl']","['Dale DC', 'Bolyard AA', 'Schwinzer BG', 'Pracht G', 'Bonilla MA', 'Boxer L', 'Freedman MH', 'Donadieu J', 'Kannourakis G', 'Alter BP', 'Cham BP', 'Winkelstein J', 'Kinsey SE', 'Zeidler C', 'Welte K']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Support Cancer Ther,Supportive cancer therapy,101223683,,,,2008/07/18 09:00,2008/07/18 09:01,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['F1GL508KUN3463T3 [pii]', '10.3816/SCT.2006.n.020 [doi]']",ppublish,Support Cancer Ther. 2006 Jul 1;3(4):220-31. doi: 10.3816/SCT.2006.n.020.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The use of prophylactic antibiotics during neutropenia to reduce this complication has been widely investigated. Historical trials that tested a variety of approaches were generally small and reported mixed results. Because of the lack of compelling evidence and concerns over emergence of resistance, international guidance has continued to recommend against the routine use of antibiotic prophylaxis in this setting. The 2 recently published, large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of levofloxacin versus placebo have challenged the reluctance to adopt the policy of prophylaxis. The GIMEMA trial focused on patients receiving high-dose inpatient chemotherapy for hematologic and solid tumors. Levofloxacin prophylaxis significantly reduced febrile episodes and microbiologically documented infection and bacteremia. In contrast, the SIGNIFICANT trial randomized patients receiving cyclic, outpatient, standard-dose chemotherapy for a variety of solid tumors and lymphoma. Significant reductions in febrile neutropenia episodes and hospitalization for the treatment of infection were demonstrated with prophylaxis. A recent metaanalysis has conclusively demonstrated a reduction in mortality resulting from the use of prophylactic fluoroquinolones for the duration of neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia and after high-dose chemotherapy, and for the first cycle of standard-dose chemotherapy in patients with solid tumors and lymphomas. An inevitable consequence of antibiotic use is the development of resistance. Although there is no doubt this can occur in individual patients and in treatment centers using fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, there is little evidence that patients are harmed as a result. Nevertheless, the induction of bacterial resistance should be avoided in principle, and more work is needed to limit prescribing of antibacterial agents to situations supported by a secure evidence base. When a secure evidence base exists, as is the case now for prophylaxis after chemotherapy, further work is needed to identify subgroups of patients who benefit most from prophylaxis so that it can be applied rationally and efficiently.","['Moon, Sarah', 'Williams, Sarah', 'Cullen, Michael']","['Moon S', 'Williams S', 'Cullen M']","['The Cancer Centre, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust, Queen Elizabeth Cancer Centre, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Support Cancer Ther,Supportive cancer therapy,101223683,,,,2008/07/18 09:00,2008/07/18 09:01,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['X60G1WX4P47G78KQ [pii]', '10.3816/SCT.2006.n.018 [doi]']",ppublish,Support Cancer Ther. 2006 Jul 1;3(4):207-16. doi: 10.3816/SCT.2006.n.018.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanism associated with this observed phenomenon remains to be clarified. METHODS: The production of O2-, monitored by a validated probe (lucigenin)-based ultraweak chemiluminescence, in resting and/or phorbol-1,2-myristate-1,3-acetate (PMA)- and zymosan-stimulated systems of various leukemic PMNs was measured. In parallel with these studies, we also quantified superoxide dismutase isozymes (Cu, Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD) from these isolated PMNs by established methods. RESULTS: A marked increase was observed in O2- generation by the PMNs from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but not from patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) when compared with controls either in the resting condition or after being stimulated by either PMA or zymosan. In parallel, we also quantified SOD isozyme activities and found that the total and CuZn-SOD of PMNs from AML were indeed significantly lower than either controls or ALL, implying that higher levels of O2- generation might result from a deficiency in this O2- metabolizing enzyme. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that a distinct difference in the capability of O2- generation under stimulated conditions between PMNs from ALL and AML (or CML) may be of potential taxonomic or even therapeutic usefulness.","['Tsai, Li-Yu', 'Tung, Jai-Nien', 'Liu, Tsan-Zon']","['Tsai LY', 'Tung JN', 'Liu TZ']","['Faculty of Biomedical Laboratory Science, College of Health Sciences, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,"['11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood', 'Male', 'Neutrophils/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Superoxide Dismutase/blood', 'Superoxides/*blood']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0929-6646(08)60163-1 [pii]', '10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60163-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 2008 Jul;107(7):513-8. doi: 10.1016/S0929-6646(08)60163-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: BAALC, which has been associated with cell dedifferentiation and migration, may function as a downstream effector of activating BRAF mutations during melanomagenesis.","['Schrama, David', 'Keller, Gunhild', 'Houben, Roland', 'Ziegler, Christian G', 'Vetter-Kauczok, Claudia S', 'Ugurel, Selma', 'Becker, Jurgen C']","['Schrama D', 'Keller G', 'Houben R', 'Ziegler CG', 'Vetter-Kauczok CS', 'Ugurel S', 'Becker JC']","['Department of Dermatology, Julius-Maximilians University, Wurzburg, Germany. schrama_d@klinik.uni-wuerzburg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080716,India,J Carcinog,Journal of carcinogenesis,101153623,,,,2008/07/18 09:00,2008/07/18 09:01,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2007/10/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/18 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']","['1477-3163-7-1 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-3163-7-1 [doi]']",epublish,J Carcinog. 2008 Jul 16;7:1. doi: 10.1186/1477-3163-7-1.,,,PMC2483271,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate possible toxicity on the male reproductive system during arsenic therapy, male mice were used as a model. Outbred mice (ICR/CD1 and S-W, 6 weeks old) were subcutaneously administered As2O3 continuously for 5 days, with a 2-day interval, for a period of 3 weeks. As2O3 doses were 0, 0.15, 0.3, 1.5, and 3.0 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. No mice died in any dosage group. Our data showed no significant changes in food consumption or in the weight of the body, liver, testis, or epididymis after As2O3 treatment. Using histological observation to identify the stages of seminiferous tubules, we showed that As2O3 treatment resulted in the inhibition of spermatogenesis. The frequency of mature seminiferous tubules (stages VII and VIII) was markedly decreased after As2O3 treatment. A significant decrease in sperm motility and viability also was found with computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) and a SYBR14/PI staining assay. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we found a significant decrease in levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg body weight. No significant difference was found in plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in all dosages. A significant decrease was found in plasma testosterone in all dosages, but no difference in intratesticular testosterone, with the exception of As2O3 at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg body weight. Moreover, there was a significant decrease in the levels of mRNA involved in testicular testosterone synthesis, cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage (P450scc), 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD), and cytochrome P450 17-alpha hydroxylase/C17-20 lyase (Cyp17). The use of immunohistological observation showed no obvious difference in the testosterone level of Leydig cells of mice treated with As2O3 at doses of 0.3 and 1.5 mg/kg body weight. We concluded that As2O3 treatment caused damage to sperm mobility and viability. As2O3 treatment disturbed spermatogenesis via reducing gene expression of the key enzymes in testosterone synthesis.","['Chiou, Tzeon-Jye', 'Chu, Sin-Tak', 'Tzeng, Woan-Fang', 'Huang, Yu-Chen', 'Liao, Chi-Jr']","['Chiou TJ', 'Chu ST', 'Tzeng WF', 'Huang YC', 'Liao CJ']","['Division of Transfusion Medicine, Department of Medicine, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, National Yang-Ming University School of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan. tjchiou@vghtpe.gov.tw']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080717,United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '3XMK78S47O (Testosterone)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)', '9035-51-2 (Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Outbred Strains', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leydig Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Luteinizing Hormone/blood', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Oxides/*toxicity', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Seminiferous Tubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Sperm Motility/drug effects', 'Spermatogenesis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Spermatozoa/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Testis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Testosterone/analysis/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/07/18 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx700366x [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2008 Aug;21(8):1562-9. doi: 10.1021/tx700366x.

METHODS: The mononuclear cells (MNCs) were derived by density gradient centrifugation and the CD34+ cells were separated from MNCs. The human umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells were cultivated through 49 different combinations of cytokines including leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF), oncostatin M, bFGF, aFGF, hepatocyte growth factor, EGF and stem cell factor for 28 days, and the concentrations of the cytokines were 10, 10, 10, 10, 20, 20 and 50 ng/mL, respectively. The mRNAs of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19), CK-18, glutamine synthetase (GS), human albumin (ALB) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were detected every seven days. The ALB secretion ability, detoxification ability and hepatic synthesis ability of the induced cells were detected by immunofluorescence assay, indocyanine green (ICG) and periodic acid-schiff assay, respectively. The fresh umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells were detected at the same time as a control. RESULTS: The mRNAs of CK-19, CK-18 and GS could be transcribed in all the induced cells, but the transcription of the mRNAs of ALB and AFP which was the special mark of mature hepatocyte and liver stem cell, respectively, was not found. All the mRNAs could not be found in freshly isolated umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells. All the cells induced in vitro could not release ALB, and not help the detoxification of ICG which was the fundamental function of mature liver cells. These results were the same in the control group. The hepatic synthesis ability of all the induced cells increased by comparison to the fresh ones. CONCLUSION: Though some mRNAs of proteins which are transcribed in hepatocytes can be found in the induced cells, umbilical cord blood-derived CD34+ cells could not be transdifferentiated into hepatocyte-like cells through cytokines in vitro.","['Chen, Yiqi', 'Cai, Haibo', 'Tan, Wensong']","['Chen Y', 'Cai H', 'Tan W']","['State Key Lab of Bioreactor Engineering, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, 200237, P.R.China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,9425194,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Hepatocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Stem Cells']",2008/07/18 09:00,2009/06/13 09:00,['2008/07/18 09:00'],"['2008/07/18 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/18 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi. 2008 Jun;22(6):747-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The pathological response rate was 70%. Twenty-three tumours (26%) changed hormone receptor classification after chemotherapy (7, ER; 16 PR). A significant change was also observed for Her2/neu status. Eleven tumours which were positive prior to PST down-regulated Her2/neu after chemotherapy. The median Ki-67 index decreased from 30% before to 13% after treatment (p<0.01). Minor changes were observed in the expression of Bcl-2 and p53 (9%).

Each tumor had one or more distinctive marker chromosomes. Marker chromosomes were present in a total of 700 of 711 metaphases from these tumors, which included an early malignant lesion of the cervix showing minimal invasion. Two tumors (a Stage 4 carcinoma of the cervix and a reticulum cell sarcoma, both untreated) yielded preparations of high quality. The 7 best-spread metaphases from the former with the modal number of chromosomes (60) had identical karyotypes, as did 16 from the latter with the modal number of 49. Less extensive data on 13 other tumors, 8 of which had marker chromosomes, are also presented. The data presented here, together with the published data on the chromosomes of cells from human tumors, support the view that human malignant tumors frequently but not invariably arise from a single cell in which chromosome changes have occurred. A carcinoma of the corpus uteri, to which brief reference is made, is a possible exception: Most metaphases had apparently normal karyotypes. The role of chromosome abnormalities (particularly structural changes) in the malignant transformation is discussed. Possible parallels between the chromosome findings in the cells of malignant tumors and those in chronic myeloid leukemia are considered. It is suggested that in tumors there may be both specific changes (perhaps involving chromosomes structurally changed) and coincidental changes. Variation in the coincidental changes might largely account for the wide differences between the karyotypes of different tumors.","['Atkin, N B', 'Baker, M C']","['Atkin NB', 'Baker MC']","['Department of Cancer Research, Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex, England.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Genetic Markers)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Carcinoma/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Colonic Neoplasms/genetics', 'Female', '*Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Rectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'Testicular Neoplasms/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/genetics', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics']",1966/03/01 00:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['1966/03/01 00:00'],"['1966/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '1966/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1966 Mar;36(3):539-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ribonuclease solutions digested the nucleoids of the virus particles in the plasma preparations from mice infected with Rauscher leukemia virus.

After coriphosphine staining of the plasma virus preparations, the fluorescence was quenched in preparations treated with ribonuclease, but did not appear to be diminished in those treated with deoxyribonuclease.

The evidence indicates that size of herd has an influence on the incidence rate of leukemia--the rate being higher in large herds than in small.","['Conner, G H', 'LaBelle, J A', 'Langham, R F', 'Crittenden, M']","['Conner GH', 'LaBelle JA', 'Langham RF', 'Crittenden M']","['College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*veterinary', 'Male', 'Michigan/epidemiology']",1966/03/01 00:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['1966/03/01 00:00'],"['1966/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '1966/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1966 Mar;36(3):383-8.,,"['CA-07839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'PH43-62-142/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin 11 (IL-11) reduces the incidence and the severity of thrombocytopenia in solid tumors. METHODS: The authors investigated the efficacy and safety of low-dose IL-11 for improving thrombocytopenia associated with TKI therapy in 14 patients with CML. The starting dose of IL-11 was 10 microg/kg 3 times weekly, and the dose was escalated by 1 dose level every 2 weeks if the patients had no sustained platelet increase. RESULTS: The median patient age was 52 years. The median platelet count at the time IL-11 was started was 37 x 10(9)/L. All patients had prior TKI dose reductions. After the initiation of IL-11, 8 of 14 patients (57%) had an increase in platelet count with a median peak platelet count of 110 x 10(9)/L. One additional patient had no platelet increase but was able to tolerate an imatinib dose increase. Eleven patients had a decrease in the number of days of TKI therapy interruption secondary to thrombocytopenia after the initiation of IL-11 (6% of total treatment time vs 34% of total treatment time before IL-11). Therapy was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that IL-11 may correct thrombocytopenia associated with TKI therapy for patients with CML and that it has a favorable toxicity profile.","['Aribi, Ahmed', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Koller, Charles', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Aribi A', 'Kantarjian H', 'Koller C', 'Thomas D', 'Faderl S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Therapy is stratified according to risk of thrombohaemorrhagic events. In high-risk patients, platelet reduction is generally recommended. In intermediate-risk patients, therapy should be considered depending on the severity of associated risk factors, especially cardiovascular. In low-risk patients, a watch-and-wait approach is appropriate. Hydroxycarbamide is generally first-line therapy. Concerns for possible leukemogenicity make anagrelide or interferon-alpha possible choices in younger patients and those who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxycarbamide. Each pharmacotherapy is associated with specific long-term risks and benefits. The potential risk of major bleeding is the main drawback of aspirin. Hydroxycarbamide is an established, effective drug for ET, but it may increase the risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and may give mucocutaneous ulcers. Anagrelide is a licensed treatment that also reduces platelet counts and is generally well tolerated, with evidence that some common side effects diminish over time. Anagrelide can have cardiac effects due to inhibition of phosphodiesterase III and therefore requires cautious use in patients with cardiac insufficiency. There is no evidence of leukaemogenicity with anagrelide or interferon-alpha therapy. Interferon-alpha is the only treatment suitable for use during pregnancy, although it is not licensed in ET. While it is effective for platelet reduction, the use of interferon-alpha is restricted by psychiatric side effects. Our knowledge of the optimum pharmacotherapy for each patient with ET continues to evolve through research and clinical trials, particularly into the molecular basis of the disease.","['Birgegard, Gunnar']",['Birgegard G'],"['Department of Haematology, Division of Medicine, Institution for Medical Sciences, University Hospital, Uppsala 75185, Sweden. gunnar.birgegard@medsci.uu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080716,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fibrinolytic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'PubMed', 'Quinazolines', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*physiopathology/*therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/*physiopathology/*therapy']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0531-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2009 Jan;88(1):1-10. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0531-7.

Release from MVB is thought to occur by Ca(2+)-regulated fusion with the plasma membrane. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To address the role of the MVB pathway in replication of the murine leukemia virus (MLV) we took advantage of mouse models for the Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) and Griscelli syndrome. In humans, these disorders are characterized by hypopigmentation and immunological alterations that are caused by defects in the biogenesis and trafficking of MVBs and other lysosome related organelles. Neonatal mice for these disease models lacking functional AP-3, Rab27A and BLOC factors were infected with Moloney MLV and the spread of virus into bone marrow, spleen and thymus was monitored. We found a moderate reduction in MLV infection levels in most mutant mice, which differed by less than two-fold compared to wild-type mice. In vitro, MLV release form bone-marrow derived macrophages was slightly enhanced. Finally, we found no evidence for a Ca(2+)-regulated release pathway in vitro. Furthermore, MLV replication was only moderately affected in mice lacking Synaptotagmin VII, a Ca(2+)-sensor regulating lysosome fusion with the plasma membrane. CONCLUSIONS: Given that MLV spreading in mice depends on multiple rounds of replication even moderate reduction of virus release at the cellular level would accumulate and lead to a significant effect over time. Thus our in vivo and in vitro data collectively argue against an essential role for a MVB- and secretory lysosome-mediated pathway in the egress of MLV.","['Chan, Wai-Tsing', 'Sherer, Nathan M', 'Uchil, Pradeep D', 'Novak, Edward K', 'Swank, Richard T', 'Mothes, Walther']","['Chan WT', 'Sherer NM', 'Uchil PD', 'Novak EK', 'Swank RT', 'Mothes W']","['Section of Microbial Pathogenesis, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080716,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['134193-27-4 (Synaptotagmins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Exocytosis', 'Hermanski-Pudlak Syndrome/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence/methods', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Synaptotagmins/metabolism', 'Syndrome']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002713 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jul 16;3(7):e2713. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002713.,,['R21 AI065284/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2443282,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A simple search for 'cancer' from a typical Web browser search engine yields more than half a million hits; an even more specific search for 'leukaemia' (>40 000 hits) or 'p53' (>5700 hits) yields far too many hits to allow one to identify particular sites of interest. This review aims to provide a brief guide to some of the resources and databases that can be used as springboards to home in rapidly on information relevant to many fields of cancer research. As such, this article will not focus on a single website but hopes to illustrate some of the ways that postgenomic biology is revolutionizing cancer research.

The aim was to investigate whether disruption of a single gene would result in significant deviation in the expression of other genes in these organisms. We describe here a simple approach for a stringent statistical evaluation of cDNA array data. This includes: (i) determination of intra- and interassay variation coefficients for different expression levels, (ii) rejection of biased duplicates, (iii) mathematical background determination, and (iv) comparison of expression levels of identical copies of a gene. The results demonstrated a highly significant correlation of gene expression when the mutants were individually compared with the wildtype. Altogether, 81 deviations of the expression of 59 genes were noted, out of 12,870, when 3-fold or greater up- or down-regulation was used as a criterion of differential expression. In the light of current knowledge of E. coli biology, the differential expression did not follow any logical pattern. In fact, the deviations may simply represent inter-assay variation. The results obtained here with a simple model organism are different from those obtained with most mammalian knockouts: disruption of the function of a single gene does not, under good growth conditions, necessarily result in great changes in the expression of other genes.","['Salmelin, Camilla', 'Vilpo, Juhani']","['Salmelin C', 'Vilpo J']","['Leukemia Research Laboratory, Department of Clinical Chemistry, Tampere University Hospital, and Tampere University Medical School, Tampere, Finland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Egypt,Comp Funct Genomics,Comparative and functional genomics,101090797,,,,2008/07/17 09:00,2008/07/17 09:01,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2001/09/13 00:00 [received]', '2001/12/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cfg.140 [doi]'],ppublish,Comp Funct Genomics. 2002;3(1):3-13. doi: 10.1002/cfg.140.,,,PMC2447237,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, once primordial germ cells are separated and placed on a feeder layer with cytokines, they become cultured pluripotent cell lines called embryonic germ (EG) cells. EG cells share several important characteristics with embryonic stem (ES) cells as they can also contribute to the germ line of chimeras. To investigate the characteristics of PGCs and establish rabbit EG (rEG) cells, we cultured rabbit PGCs (rPGCs) in vitro with various combinations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and forskolin on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) feeder layers.

In previous studies, natural killer (NK) cell expansion by lenalidomide was shown to enhance the cytotoxic effect of rituximab. This study assessed the ability of lenalidomide to enhance antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in rituximab-treated NHL cell lines and primary tumor cells from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An in vitro ADCC system was used to assess the ability of lenalidomide to enhance human NK cell and monocyte function in response to rituximab. RESULTS: Lenalidomide directly enhanced IFN-gamma production via Fc-gamma receptor-mediated signaling in response to IgG. It was also a potent enhancer of NK cell-mediated and monocyte-mediated tumor cell ADCC for a variety of rituximab-treated NHL cell lines in vitro, an effect that was dependent on the presence of antibody and either interleukin-2 or interleukin-12. Lenalidomide also enhanced the ability of NK cells to kill primary tumor cells derived from three patients with B-CLL who have been treated previously with fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide. Enhanced NK cell ADCC was associated with enhanced granzyme B and Fas ligand expression and could be inhibited by a granzyme B inhibitor and partially inhibited by antibody to FasL. Enhanced NK cell Fc-gamma receptor signaling is associated with enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-related kinase levels leading to enhanced effector function. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that lenalidomide has the potential to enhance the rituximab-induced killing of NHL cell lines and primary B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells via a NK cell-mediated and monocyte-mediated ADCC mechanism in vitro, providing a strong rationale for the combination of lenalidomide with IgG1 antibodies to target tumor-specific antigens in patients with cancer.","['Wu, Lei', 'Adams, Mary', 'Carter, Troy', 'Chen, Roger', 'Muller, George', 'Stirling, David', 'Schafer, Peter', 'Bartlett, J Blake']","['Wu L', 'Adams M', 'Carter T', 'Chen R', 'Muller G', 'Stirling D', 'Schafer P', 'Bartlett JB']","['Celgene Corporation, Summit, New Jersey 07901, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*drug effects', 'Antigens, CD20/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Lenalidomide', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Rituximab', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/14/4650 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4405 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 15;14(14):4650-7. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4405.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized critical tyrosine residues responsible for the transforming potential of active FLT3-receptor mutants and ligand-dependent activation of FLT3-WT. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed a detailed structure-function analysis of putative autophosphorylation tyrosine residues in the FLT3-D835Y tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) mutant. All tyrosine residues in the juxtamembrane domain (Y566, Y572, Y589, Y591, Y597, and Y599), interkinase domain (Y726 and Y768), and COOH-terminal domain (Y955 and Y969) of the FLT3-D835Y construct were successively mutated to phenylalanine and the transforming activity of these mutants was analyzed in interleukin-3-dependent Ba/F3 cells. Tyrosine residues critical for the transforming potential of FLT3-D835Y were also analyzed in FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutants (FLT3-ITD)and the FLT3 wild-type (FLT3-WT) receptor. RESULT: The substitution of the tyrosine residues by phenylalanine in the juxtamembrane, interkinase, and COOH-terminal domains resulted in a complete loss of the transforming potential of FLT3-D835Y-expressing cells which can be attributed to a significant reduction of signal tranducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) phosphorylation at the molecular level. Reintroduction of single tyrosine residues revealed the critical role of Y589 and Y591 in reconstituting interleukin-3-independent growth of FLT3-TKD-expressing cells. Combined mutation of Y589 and Y591 to phenylalanine also abrogated ligand-dependent proliferation of FLT3-WT and the transforming potential of FLT3-ITD-with a subsequent abrogation of STAT5 phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: We identified two tyrosine residues, Y589 and Y591, in the juxtamembrane domain that are critical for the ligand-dependent activation of FLT3-WT and the transforming potential of oncogenic FLT3 mutants.","['Vempati, Sridhar', 'Reindl, Carola', 'Wolf, Ulla', 'Kern, Ruth', 'Petropoulos, Konstantin', 'Naidu, Vegi M', 'Buske, Christian', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Kohl, Tobias M', 'Spiekermann, Karsten']","['Vempati S', 'Reindl C', 'Wolf U', 'Kern R', 'Petropoulos K', 'Naidu VM', 'Buske C', 'Hiddemann W', 'Kohl TM', 'Spiekermann K']","['GSF-National Research Center for Environment, University of Munich-Grosshadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Fiz1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*chemistry/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phosphorylation', 'Point Mutation', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tyrosine/*chemistry/genetics']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/14/4437 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1873 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 15;14(14):4437-45. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-1873.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations within the kinase domain of BCR-ABL1 constitute the most frequent mechanism of resistance in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia treated with imatinib or the second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib. Of particular concern is the substitution of the threonine residue at the highly conserved gatekeeper residue 315 with a bulkier hydrophobic isoleucine amino acid. This mutation causes steric hindrance precluding the access ATP-competitive inhibitors to the ATP-binding pocket. To expedite the identification of strategies to override the resistance imposed by the T315I mutation, several strategies have been pursued, including the exploitation of BCR-ABL1 kinase sites distant from the ATP-binding pocket to cripple the kinase activity of the enzyme and inhibiting signaling pathways downstream from BCR-ABL1.

In particular, segmental duplications representing blocks of >1 kb with >90% sequence homology were shown to mediate non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR). However, the occurrence of the majority of newly detected submicroscopic imbalances cannot be explained by the presence of segmental duplications. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate whether architectural features other than segmental duplications mediate these rearrangements. METHODS: We analysed a series of patients with breakpoints clustering within chromosome band 5q35. Using high density arrays and subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), we characterised the breakpoints of four interstitial deletions (including one associated with an unbalanced paracentric inversion), a duplication and a familial reciprocal t(5;18)(q35;q22) translocation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Five of the breakpoints were located within an interval of approximately 265 kb encompassing the RANBP17 and TLX3 genes. This region is also targeted by the recurrent cryptic t(5;14)(q35;q32) translocation, which occurs in approximately 20% of childhood T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). In silico analysis indicated the architectural features most likely to contribute to the genomic instability of this region, which was supported by our molecular data. Of further interest, in two patients and the familial translocation, the delineated breakpoint regions encompassed highly homologous LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), suggesting that NAHR between these LINEs may have mediated these rearrangements.","['Buysse, K', 'Crepel, A', 'Menten, B', 'Pattyn, F', 'Antonacci, F', 'Veltman, J A', 'Larsen, L A', 'Tumer, Z', 'de Klein, A', 'van de Laar, I', 'Devriendt, K', 'Mortier, G', 'Speleman, F']","['Buysse K', 'Crepel A', 'Menten B', 'Pattyn F', 'Antonacci F', 'Veltman JA', 'Larsen LA', 'Tumer Z', 'de Klein A', 'van de Laar I', 'Devriendt K', 'Mortier G', 'Speleman F']",,['eng'],"['Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080715,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,,IM,"['*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Duplication', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['jmg.2008.058883 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2008.058883 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2008 Oct;45(10):672-8. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2008.058883.

Current combinatorial therapies with vitamin D3 are restricted to differentiation effects. It remains uncertain if autophagy is involved in vitamin D3 inhibition on leukemia cells. Here we show that besides triggering differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis, which was previously known, vitamin D3 triggers autophagic death in human myeloid leukemia cells. Inhibiting differentiation does not efficiently diminish vitamin D3 suppression on leukemia cells. Vitamin D3 up-regulates Beclin1, which binds to class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to trigger autophagy. Vitamin D3 phosphorylates Bad in its BH3 domain, resulting in disassociation of the apoptotic Bad-Bcl-xL complex and association of Bcl-xL with Beclin1 and ultimate suppression of apoptotic signaling. Knockdown of Beclin1 eliminates vitamin D3-induced autophagy and inhibits differentiation but activates apoptosis, suggesting that Beclin1 is required for both autophagy and differentiation, and autophagy cooperates with differentiation but excludes apoptosis, in which Beclin1 acts as an interface for these three different cascades.

These findings extend our understanding of the action of vitamin D3 in antineoplastic effects and the role of Beclin1 in regulating multiple cellular cascades and suggest a potentially promising strategy with a significantly better antileukemia effect.","['Wang, Jianrong', 'Lian, Huiqin', 'Zhao, Ying', 'Kauss, Mara A', 'Spindel, Samantha']","['Wang J', 'Lian H', 'Zhao Y', 'Kauss MA', 'Spindel S']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853; Treman Research Institute, Ithaca, New York 14850.

Since then, several additional anticancer antibody products have received regulatory approval, including the monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) trastuzumab for breast cancer and alemtuzumab for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the MoAb immunoconjugates gemtuzumab ozogamicin for acute myelogenous leukemia and yttrium 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan for B-cell lymphoma. These products are associated with adverse events that are quite different than those seen with chemotherapy. Adverse events associated with MoAb products typically have 1 of 3 etiologies: direct and indirect effects of antibody-antigen interaction, effects of toxins or radioisotopes that have been conjugated to antibodies, and allergic and hypersensitivity reactions to foreign protein. The infusion-related symptom complex is the most common and predictable side effect associated with all MoAbs that react with circulating blood cells. This pattern of various systemic effects includes flu-like symptoms such as headache, shortness of breath, fever, skin rash, hypotension, nausea, and asthenia, but usually occurs only in association with the first of any series of weekly infusions. The severity of these reactions is influenced by the rate of infusion, and the syndrome is the consequence of cytokines released from immune cells. Severe hypotension, bronchospasm, hypoxia, and even death have occurred. A true tumor lysis syndrome may occur if there are large numbers of proliferating antigen-positive cells in the blood. Symptoms related to the infusion reaction are ameliorated by slowing or stopping the infusion and administering antiinflammatory agents and antihistamines.","['Dillman, Robert O', 'Hendrix, Carolyn S']","['Dillman RO', 'Hendrix CS']","['Hoag Cancer Center, Newport Beach, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Support Cancer Ther,Supportive cancer therapy,101223683,,,,2008/07/17 09:00,2008/07/17 09:01,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:01 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['R72564864245U23L [pii]', '10.3816/SCT.2003.n.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Support Cancer Ther. 2003 Oct 1;1(1):38-48. doi: 10.3816/SCT.2003.n.003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We summarize the experience of our hospital, one of Spain's largest series of renal (294), liver (47) and allogeneic stem cell transplants (67), where four cases of PTLD have developed related to complex viral infections. METHODS: Case 1 was a 24-month-old boy diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who underwent allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT). He was seropositive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and developed an aggressive Bcell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) related to EBV reactivation and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection. Cases 2, 3, and 4 developed after kidney transplantation and were all EBV seronegative. Case 2 had associated cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV infection. Cases 3 and 4 only revealed EBV viral load. Cases 1, 3, and 4 progressed rapidly, with fatal outcome. Global incidence of PTLD in our series is 1.1%. CONCLUSION: PTLD is a rare but life-threatening condition. Although EBV plays a clear role in its pathogenesis, other associated viral infections could trigger this situation. Current therapies include rituximab, decreasing immunosuppressive drugs. and conventional chemotherapy.","['Vila, L', 'Moreno, L', 'Andres, M M', 'Fernandez, J M', 'Verdeguer, A', 'Perez-Valle, S', 'Sanguesa, C', 'Berbel, O', 'Castel, V']","['Vila L', 'Moreno L', 'Andres MM', 'Fernandez JM', 'Verdeguer A', 'Perez-Valle S', 'Sanguesa C', 'Berbel O', 'Castel V']","['Paediatric Oncology Unit, Hospital Infantil La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,Italy,Clin Transl Oncol,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,101247119,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'Cytomegalovirus Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/epidemiology', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*virology', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/*virology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Tumor Virus Infections/complications/epidemiology/*virology', 'Viral Load', 'Virus Diseases/*complications/epidemiology']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLAT63 [pii]', '10.1007/s12094-008-0225-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Transl Oncol. 2008 Jul;10(7):422-5. doi: 10.1007/s12094-008-0225-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular responses inducing resistance to oxidative stress are important for cellular survival, organism lifespan, and cancer prevention, but until recently, mammalian factors regulating resistance to oxidative stress have not been well characterized. Significant evidence supports excessive apoptosis of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, induced by stresses, most significantly oxidative stress, as a critical factor in the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure and leukemia progression in FA.

The failure of HSCs to self-renew during aging is believed to depend on several intrinsic (cell-autonomous) and extrinsic (non-cell-autonomous) factors. In this review, we focus on how dysregulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and disruptions of genomic stability can impair HSC functions. Recently, it was shown that long-term self-renewing HSCs normally possess low levels of intracellular ROS. However, when intracellular ROS levels become excessive, they cause senescence or apoptosis, resulting in a failure of HSC self-renewal. Repression of intracellular ROS levels in HSCs by treatment with an antioxidant that scavenges ROS can rescue HSC functions, indicating that excess ROS levels are at the root of HSC failure. Products of numerous genes that are involved in either DNA-damage responses or longevity-related signaling contribute to the maintenance of the HSC self-renewal capacity. Further investigations on the molecular mechanisms of ROS regulation and on the manipulation of excess ROS levels could lead to the development of novel therapeutics for hematopoietic diseases, regenerative medicine, and the prevention of leukemia.","['Naka, Kazuhito', 'Muraguchi, Teruyuki', 'Hoshii, Takayuki', 'Hirao, Atsushi']","['Naka K', 'Muraguchi T', 'Hoshii T', 'Hirao A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Center for Cancer and Stem Cell Research, Cancer Research Institute, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Ishikawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,['0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)'],IM,"['Aging/physiology', 'Animals', 'DNA Damage', '*Genomic Instability', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Telomere/metabolism']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ars.2008.2114 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2008 Nov;10(11):1883-94. doi: 10.1089/ars.2008.2114.,90,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we briefly review general concepts pertaining to IUPs and then discuss our structural, biophysical, and biochemical studies of two IUPs, p21 and p27, which regulate the mammalian cell division cycle by inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). Some segments of these two proteins are partially folded in isolation, and they fold further upon binding their biological targets. Interestingly, some portions of p27 remain flexible after binding to and inhibiting the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. This residual flexibility allows otherwise buried tyrosine residues within p27 to be phosphorylated by non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs). Tyrosine phosphorylation relieves kinase inhibition, triggering Cdk2-mediated phosphorylation of a threonine residue within the flexible C-terminus of p27. This, in turn, marks p27 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, unleashing full Cdk2 activity which drives cell cycle progression. p27, thus, constitutes a conduit for transmission of proliferative signals via post-translational modifications. The term ""conduit"" is used here to connote a means of transmission of molecular signals which, in the case of p27, correspond to tyrosine and threonine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and, ultimately, proteolytic degradation. Transmission of these multiple signals is enabled by the inherent flexibility of p27 which persists even after tight binding to the Cdk2-cyclin A complex. Importantly, activation of the p27 signaling conduit by oncogenic NRTKs contributes to tumorigenesis in some human cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [Grimmler, M., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 269-280] and breast cancer [Chu, I., et al. (2007) Cell 128, 281-294]. Other IUPs may participate in conceptually similar molecular signaling conduits, and dysregulation of these putative conduits may contribute to other human diseases. Detailed study of these IUPs, both alone and within functional complexes, is required to test these hypotheses and to more fully understand the relationships between protein disorder and biological function.","['Galea, Charles A', 'Wang, Yuefeng', 'Sivakolundu, Sivashankar G', 'Kriwacki, Richard W']","['Galea CA', 'Wang Y', 'Sivakolundu SG', 'Kriwacki RW']","[""Department of Structural Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, 332 North Lauderdale Street, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cyclin A/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/chemistry/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2008/07/17 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/07/17 09:00'],"['2008/07/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi8006803 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2008 Jul 22;47(29):7598-609. doi: 10.1021/bi8006803.,98,"['5P30CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082491-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01CA082491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA082491/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2580775,['NIHMS71338'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a protocol to activate and expand tumor and virus peptide-specific CD8(+) T-lymphocytes from the peripheral blood of healthy, human trophic leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) seronegative human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201 individuals. A combination of density-based separation and culture conditions was employed to isolate dendritic cells (DCs), which are the most potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and T-lymphocytes. The DCs were pulsed with HLA-A*0201 binding peptides and cultured with autologous T-lymphocytes to generate peptide-specific CTLs. The CTLs were generated against a nine-amino-acid peptide from the Tax protein of HTLV-1. The CTLs were expanded according to a restimulation schedule employing peptide-pulsed autologous monocytes and low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) to numbers in excess of 100 x 10(6) cells following 5 weeks of culture. Expanded cells contained primarily CD3(+) T-cells, of which CD8(+) T-lymphocytes constituted greater than two-thirds of the cell population. Obtained CTLs exhibited potent antigen-specific lysis of peptide-pulsed target cells in a dose-dependent fashion in in vitro (51)Cr release cytotoxicity assay. This antigen-specific killing was shown to be HLA class I restricted and mediated by CD8(+) T-lymphocytes. Since the T-lymphocytes were obtained from HTLV-1 seronegative donors, the generation of peptide-specific CTLs represents reliable and reproducible elicitation of a primary immune response in vitro against naive antigens and subsequent expansion of generated CTLs for adoptive immunotherapy.

Fetal bone marrow CD34(hi)/lin(-) cells were cultured at one cell per well in the presence of c-kit ligand (KL), interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) on a murine stroma cell monolayer. Individual wells were scored for growth between 1 and 10 weeks of culture and analyzed by flow cytometry for lineage composition. A wide variation in time (1 to 8 weeks) was observed before initial cell division, even in the presence of cytokines promoting cell division in primitive progenitors. Eleven percent of the plated cells eventually produced a confluent culture well of approximately 20,000 progeny. Confluent wells were harvested and individually analyzed by flow cytometry for cell surface phenotype. Forty-eight percent of confluent wells contained primitive progenitors (CD34(+)lin(-)), 16% contained B-lymphoid cells (CD19(+) or CD10(+)), and 100% contained cells committed to the myelo-erythroid lineage (CD33(+)). CD34(+)/lin(-) cells from confluent wells were replated at one cell per well in secondary culture and the analysis repeated. One of 216 original single cells plated produced populations of B-lymphoid cells, myeloid cells, and primitive progenitors (CD34(+)/lin(-)) which persisted through two expansion cycles. We estimate that more than 36 million cells can be produced from a single cell under these culture conditions. A very small percentage of the CD34(hi)/lin(-) population (about 1%) was responsible for the majority of subsequent cell production. Our estimate of stem cell content in fetal bone marrow, defined by self-renewal as well as both B-lymphoid and myeloid differentiation from one cell, is approximately 1/13,000. This assay system provides direct in vitro measurements of the expected characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells (high proliferation potential, multilineage potential, self-renewal, and quiescence), and is therefore well suited to assessment of stem cell activity within various cell populations.","['Young, J C', 'DiGiusto, D', 'Backer, M P']","['Young JC', 'DiGiusto D', 'Backer MP']","['Systemix Inc., Department of Cell Product Development, 1651 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,,,1996/06/05 00:00,1996/06/05 00:01,['1996/06/05 00:00'],"['1996/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19960605)50:5<465::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-D [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1996 Jun 5;50(5):465-78. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0290(19960605)50:5<465::AID-BIT1>3.0.CO;2-D.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its prognosis is generally poor and a treatment strategy has yet to be established. There are reports, however, that hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can cure this disease. To clarify the current situation regarding allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) for EBV-associated T/NK-LPD, a nationwide survey was performed in Japan. Data for 74 patients were collected. There were 42 cases of chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), 10 cases of EBV-associated hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (EBV-HLH), and 22 cases of EBV-associated lymphoma/leukemia (EBV-lymphoma/leukemia). Of those with CAEBV, 54% had the EBV-infected T-cell type and 59% with EBV-lymphoma/leukemia had the EBV-infected NK-cell type. Most patients with EBV-HLH and EBV-lymphoma/leukemia received allo-HSCT within 1 year after onset compared to only 14% of patients with CAEBV. The event-free survival (EFS) rate following allo-HSCT was 0.561 +/- 0.086 for CAEBV, 0.614 +/- 0.186 for EBV-HLH, and 0.309 +/- 0.107 for EBV-lymphoma/leukemia. The EFS of allo-HSCT with conventional conditioning was 0.488 +/- 0.074 and with reduced-intensity conditioning was 0.563 +/- 0.124. Thus, in a substantial number of cases, EBV-associated T/NK-LPD can be cured by either allogeneic conventional stem cell transplantation or reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation.","['Sato, Emiko', 'Ohga, Shouichi', 'Kuroda, Hiroshi', 'Yoshiba, Fumiaki', 'Nishimura, Miki', 'Nagasawa, Masayuki', 'Inoue, Masami', 'Kawa, Keisei']","['Sato E', 'Ohga S', 'Kuroda H', 'Yoshiba F', 'Nishimura M', 'Nagasawa M', 'Inoue M', 'Kawa K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, 840 Murodo-cho, Izumi, Osaka, Japan. satoemik@s3.dion.ne.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/epidemiology/pathology/surgery/virology', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/pathology/surgery/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology/*surgery/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.21247 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2008 Sep;83(9):721-7. doi: 10.1002/ajh.21247.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Dysfunction of FOXP3 in human is associated with fatal autoimmune disease known as immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked syndrome (IPEX) or X-linked autoimmunity-allergic disregulation syndrome (XLAAD). FOXP3 also can act as a breast tumor suppressor of the v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (neuro/glioblastoma derived oncogene homolog (avian)) (Her2/neu) gene. While the suppressive functions of FOXP3 in maintaining the immune balance between tolerance and autoimmunity are obvious, the underlying molecular mechanism remains almost entirely undefined. Recent studies indicate that FOXP3 may form a dynamic superamolecular complex with a variety of molecular partners including transcription factors and enzymatic proteins to regulate transcription. How the FOXP3 ensemble changes in response to T-cell receptor signals and/or proinflammatory signal remains unclear although work from this laboratory has revealed its complexity. Structural information on FOXP3 complex may offer novel functional insights, as well as facilitate the development of rational means to modulate regulatory T-cell function in various human diseases.","['Zhou, Zhaocai', 'Song, Xiaomin', 'Li, Bin', 'Greene, Mark I']","['Zhou Z', 'Song X', 'Li B', 'Greene MI']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-6082, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Immunol Res,Immunologic research,8611087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3)', '0 (RORC protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Lysine Acetyltransferase 5)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/metabolism', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lysine Acetyltransferase 5', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 1, Group F, Member 3', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/metabolism', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism']",2008/07/16 09:00,2009/03/12 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12026-008-8029-x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Res. 2008;42(1-3):19-28. doi: 10.1007/s12026-008-8029-x.,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary factor responsible for this remarkable improvement is the personalization of treatment, with stratification of patients based on both disease and host characteristics in order to optimize therapy. While age, WBC, and immunophenotype provide a rudimentary system for classification of ALL, molecular factors are playing an increasingly important role in further individualization of ALL therapy. Such risk-based stratification strategies are also increasingly being used in the treatment of children with solid tumors. In addition, genomic technologies are now being used to identify new molecular markers or signatures for both diagnostic and prognostic purposes. Recently we reported the analysis of pediatric osteosarcoma by expression profiling in an attempt to identify a molecular signature that could predict the chemoresistance of a tumor before treatment is initiated. We identified a 45-gene signature that discriminates between good and poor responders to chemotherapy in osteosarcoma. Using this classifier, we can predict with 100% accuracy the chemoresponse of osteosarcoma patients prior to the initiation of treatment.

This drug is an effective treatment for patients with CML in chronic phase as it induces hematological remission in nearly all patients and cytogenetic responses in many. The bone marrow changes produced by this drug are different from the treatment modalities used earlier in CML. MATERIALS & METHODS: We studied 80 patients of CML on treatment with Imatinib at doses of 400-800 mg per day. Morphological and cytogenetic evaluation (Ph analysis) of bone marrow aspirates was done at six months of treatment. RESULT: In our study, 95% (76 out of 80) patients showed complete hematological response and 63.3% showed major cytogenetic response at the end of six months of treatment. The most commonly observed changes in the bone marrow aspirates at the end of six months of therapy were in the form of reduction in the cellularity, reduction in the M: E ratio to a mean of 2:1, presence of relative erythroid hyperplasia, normalization of megakaryocytic morphology and variable increase in the bone marrow lymphocytes. None of these changes had significant correlation with the patient's Ph status. CONCLUSION: We advise study of trephine biopsies to overcome the often-faced problem of hemodiluted aspirates in these cases and evaluation of sequential bone marrows to check the durability of these morphological changes and their correlation with the cytogenetic response with emphasis on cytogenetic changes other than Ph positivity.","['Joshi, S', 'Sunita, P', 'Deshmukh, C', 'Gujral, S', 'Amre, P', 'Nair, C N']","['Joshi S', 'Sunita P', 'Deshmukh C', 'Gujral S', 'Amre P', 'Nair CN']","['Department of Pathology, Hemato-Oncology Laboratory and Cytogenetics Division, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2008/07/16 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4103/0019-509x.41769 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2008 Apr-Jun;45(2):45-9. doi: 10.4103/0019-509x.41769.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: The aim was to study the clinical presentation and ultrastructural changes in hairy cells (HCs) following cladribine treatment. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Clinical presentation, peripheral smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy of HCL cases diagnosed over a period of three years were reviewed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Consecutive HCL cases in Hematology clinic of a tertiary care center were enrolled. Tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test was done to detect HCs and electron microscopy was done to demonstrate initial ultrastructural changes and alterations following cladribine therapy. RESULTS: Fifteen cases of HCL, aged 32-57 years (median 47 years) were studied. The clinical presentation included splenomegaly in 15 (100%), fever in 10 (67%), hepatomegaly and pain abdomen in eight (53%), fatigue in nine (60 %) cases. The commonest laboratory features were monocytopenia in 13 (87%), neutropenia in 12 (80%), anemia in 10 (67 %) and pancytopenia in nine (60%). All patients showed symptomatic improvement on cladribine therapy. Electron microscopy after treatment (three months) showed loss of the finger like projections, characteristic bald lymphocytes, loss of ribosomal lamellar complexes, as well as decrease in mitochondria and vacuoles. CONCLUSIONS: Indian patients with HCL are younger. Cladribine is an effective therapy for these patients and leads to complete response in most of the patients. There is a significant improvement in the ultrastructural features following cladribine therapy.","['Chatterjee, T', 'Panigrahi, I', 'Mahapatra, M', 'Pati, H P', 'Kumar, R', 'Naithani, R', 'Wadhwa, S', 'Choudhry, V P', 'Saxena, R']","['Chatterjee T', 'Panigrahi I', 'Mahapatra M', 'Pati HP', 'Kumar R', 'Naithani R', 'Wadhwa S', 'Choudhry VP', 'Saxena R']","['Department of Hematology, AIIMS, Ansari Nagar, New Delhi-110 029, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'India', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/ultrastructure', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase']",2008/07/16 09:00,2009/06/19 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4103/0019-509x.41768 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2008 Apr-Jun;45(2):41-4. doi: 10.4103/0019-509x.41768.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expressed in distinct patterns in most tissues, CD38 (and CD157) cleaves NAD(+) and NADP(+), generating cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), NAADP, and ADPR. These reaction products are essential for the regulation of intracellular Ca(2+), the most ancient and universal cell signaling system. The entire family of enzymes controls complex processes, including egg fertilization, cell activation and proliferation, muscle contraction, hormone secretion, and immune responses. Over the course of evolution, the molecules have developed the ability to interact laterally and frontally with other surface proteins and have acquired receptor-like features. As detailed in this review, the loss of CD38 function is associated with impaired immune responses, metabolic disturbances, and behavioral modifications in mice. CD38 is a powerful disease marker for human leukemias and myelomas, is directly involved in the pathogenesis and outcome of human immunodeficiency virus infection and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and controls insulin release and the development of diabetes. Here, the data concerning diseases are examined in view of potential clinical applications in diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. The concluding remarks try to frame all of the currently available information within a unified working model that takes into account both the enzymatic and receptorial functions of the molecules.","['Malavasi, Fabio', 'Deaglio, Silvia', 'Funaro, Ada', 'Ferrero, Enza', 'Horenstein, Alberto L', 'Ortolan, Erika', 'Vaisitti, Tiziana', 'Aydin, Semra']","['Malavasi F', 'Deaglio S', 'Funaro A', 'Ferrero E', 'Horenstein AL', 'Ortolan E', 'Vaisitti T', 'Aydin S']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Genetics, Biology, and Biochemistry and Centro di Ricerca in Medicina Sperimentale, University of Torino Medical School, Torino, Italy. fabio.malavasi@unito.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Physiol Rev,Physiological reviews,0231714,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Ligands)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl cyclase 2)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/chemistry/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Innate', 'Immunoconjugates/therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Ligands', 'Models, Animal', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phylogeny', 'Protein Conformation', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['88/3/841 [pii]', '10.1152/physrev.00035.2007 [doi]']",ppublish,Physiol Rev. 2008 Jul;88(3):841-86. doi: 10.1152/physrev.00035.2007.,367,['GTF06004/TI_/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms by which oncogenic ETS proteins, which are DNA-binding transcription factors, target genes necessary for tumorigenesis is not well understood. Ewing's sarcoma serves as a paradigm for the entire class of ETS-associated tumors because nearly all cases harbor recurrent chromosomal translocations involving ETS genes. The most common translocation in Ewing's sarcoma encodes the EWS/FLI oncogenic transcription factor. We used whole genome localization (ChIP-chip) to identify target genes that are directly bound by EWS/FLI. Analysis of the promoters of these genes demonstrated a significant over-representation of highly repetitive GGAA-containing elements (microsatellites). In a parallel approach, we found that EWS/FLI uses GGAA microsatellites to regulate the expression of some of its target genes including NR0B1, a gene required for Ewing's sarcoma oncogenesis. The microsatellite in the NR0B1 promoter bound EWS/FLI in vitro and in vivo and was both necessary and sufficient to confer EWS/FLI regulation to a reporter gene. Genome wide computational studies demonstrated that GGAA microsatellites were enriched close to EWS/FLI-up-regulated genes but not down-regulated genes. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the ability of EWS/FLI to bind DNA and modulate gene expression through these repetitive elements depended on the number of consecutive GGAA motifs. These findings illustrate an unprecedented route to specificity for ETS proteins and use of microsatellites in tumorigenesis.","['Gangwal, Kunal', 'Sankar, Savita', 'Hollenhorst, Peter C', 'Kinsey, Michelle', 'Haroldsen, Stephen C', 'Shah, Atul A', 'Boucher, Kenneth M', 'Watkins, W Scott', 'Jorde, Lynn B', 'Graves, Barbara J', 'Lessnick, Stephen L']","['Gangwal K', 'Sankar S', 'Hollenhorst PC', 'Kinsey M', 'Haroldsen SC', 'Shah AA', 'Boucher KM', 'Watkins WS', 'Jorde LB', 'Graves BJ', 'Lessnick SL']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080714,United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (EWS-FLI fusion protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (RNA-Binding Protein EWS)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', '*Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', 'RNA-Binding Protein EWS', '*Response Elements', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transfection']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['0801073105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0801073105 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2008 Jul 22;105(29):10149-54. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0801073105.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 1,314 cases of PTCL and NKTCL was organized from 22 centers worldwide, consisting of patients with previously untreated PTCL or NKTCL who were diagnosed between 1990 and 2002. Tissue biopsies, immunophenotypic markers, molecular genetic studies, and clinical information from consecutive patients at each site were reviewed by panels of four expert hematopathologists and classified according to the WHO classification. RESULTS: A diagnosis of PTCL or NKTCL was confirmed in 1,153 (87.8%) of the cases. The most common subtypes were PTCL not otherwise specified (NOS; 25.9%), angioimmunoblastic type (18.5%), NKTCL (10.4%), and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; 9.6%). Misclassification occurred in 10.4% of the cases including Hodgkin's lymphoma (3%), B-cell lymphoma (1.4%), unclassifiable lymphoma (2.8%), or a diagnosis other than lymphoma (2.3%). We found marked variation in the frequency of the various subtypes by geographic region. The use of an anthracycline-containing regimen was not associated with an improved outcome in PTCL-NOS or angioimmunoblastic type, but was associated with an improved outcome in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, ALK positive. CONCLUSION: The WHO classification is useful for defining subtypes of PTCL and NKTCL. However, expert hematopathology review is important for accurate diagnosis. The clinical outcome for patients with most of these lymphoma subtypes is poor with standard therapies, and novel agents and new modalities are needed to improve survival.","['Vose, Julie', 'Armitage, James', 'Weisenburger, Dennis']","['Vose J', 'Armitage J', 'Weisenburger D']","['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-7680, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20080714,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biopsy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/*mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Genetic', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/09/25 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2008.16.4558 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4558 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Sep 1;26(25):4124-30. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4558.

In HUS, Stx released in the gut enter the bloodstream and are targeted to renal endothelium. The mechanism of toxin delivery is still a matter of debate, although the role of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) as a Stx carrier has been indicated. The aim of this paper was to better define the interactions between Stx and human PMN. Direct and indirect flow cytometric analysis and binding experiments with radiolabeled toxins demonstrated that Stx bind to the surface of human mature PMN but not to immature PMN from G-CSF-treated donors. The use of the human myeloid leukemia cell (HL-60) model for inducible cell differentiation confirmed that the toxin binding occurs only after granulocytic differentiation. Stx binding caused a delay of the spontaneous apoptosis of PMN, as shown by the delayed appearance of apoptotic nuclei and activation of caspase 3 and by the higher number of cells negative to the annexin V-binding assay after 48 h. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis of mixed Stx-positive and Stx-negative PMN populations showed that the toxins were transferred from positive to negative PMN. The delayed, spontaneous apoptosis and the passage of the toxic ligand from older PMN to new, mature cells entering the circulation from the bone marrow may explain the previously reported persistence of Stx in the blood of children with HUS.","['Brigotti, Maurizio', 'Carnicelli, Domenica', 'Ravanelli, Elisa', 'Barbieri, Stefania', 'Ricci, Francesca', 'Bontadini, Andrea', 'Tozzi, Alberto E', 'Scavia, Gaia', 'Caprioli, Alfredo', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi']","['Brigotti M', 'Carnicelli D', 'Ravanelli E', 'Barbieri S', 'Ricci F', 'Bontadini A', 'Tozzi AE', 'Scavia G', 'Caprioli A', 'Tazzari PL']","['Universita di Bologna, Via San Giacomo, 14, Bologna, Italy 40126. maurizio.brigotti@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080714,United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (Shiga Toxins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Biological Transport', 'Caspase 3/blood/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Escherichia coli/pathogenicity', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/pathology', 'Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Shiga Toxins/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['jlb.0308157 [pii]', '10.1189/jlb.0308157 [doi]']",ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2008 Oct;84(4):1019-27. doi: 10.1189/jlb.0308157.

Loss of GATA1 function results in excessive megakaryocyte proliferation and disordered terminal platelet maturation, leading to thrombocytopenia and leukemia in patients. The mechanisms by which GATA1 does this are unclear. We have used in vivo biotinylated GATA1 to isolate megakaryocyte GATA1-partner proteins. Here, several independent approaches show that GATA1 interacts with several proteins in the megakaryocyte cell line L8057 and in primary megakaryocytes. They include FOG1, the NURD complex, the pentameric complex containing SCL/TAL-1, the zinc-finger regulators GFI1B and ZFP143, and the corepressor ETO2. Knockdown of ETO2 expression promotes megakaryocyte differentiation and enhances expression of select genes expressed in terminal megakaryocyte maturation, eg, platelet factor 4 (Pf4). ETO2-dependent direct repression of the Pf4 proximal promoter is mediated by GATA-binding sites and an E-Box motif. Consistent with this, endogenous ETO2, GATA1, and the SCL pentameric complex all specifically bind the promoter in vivo. Finally, as ETO2 expression is restricted to immature megakaryocytes, these data suggest that ETO2 directly represses inappropriate early expression of a subset of terminally expressed megakaryocyte genes by binding to GATA1 and SCL.","['Hamlett, Isla', 'Draper, Julia', 'Strouboulis, John', 'Iborra, Francisco', 'Porcher, Catherine', 'Vyas, Paresh']","['Hamlett I', 'Draper J', 'Strouboulis J', 'Iborra F', 'Porcher C', 'Vyas P']","['Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit and Department of Haematology, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080714,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotinylation', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'E-Box Elements/genetics', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiprotein Complexes/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Platelet Factor 4/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Streptavidin/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation/genetics']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59799-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-146605 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Oct 1;112(7):2738-49. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-146605.

NPM binds the Arf tumor suppressor and protects it from degradation. The AML-associated NPM mutant (NPMmut) also binds p19Arf but is unable to protect it from degradation, which suggests that inactivation of p19Arf contributes to leukemogenesis in AMLs. We report here that NPM regulates turnover of the c-Myc oncoprotein by acting on the F-box protein Fbw7gamma, a component of the E3 ligase complex involved in the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of c-Myc. NPM was required for nucleolar localization and stabilization of Fbw7gamma. As a consequence, c-Myc was stabilized in cells lacking NPM. Expression of NPMmut also led to c-Myc stabilization because of its ability to interact with Fbw7gamma and delocalize it to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded. Because Fbw7 induces degradation of other growth-promoting proteins, the NPM-Fbw7 interaction emerges as a central tumor suppressor mechanism in human cancer.","['Bonetti, Paola', 'Davoli, Teresa', 'Sironi, Cristina', 'Amati, Bruno', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Colombo, Emanuela']","['Bonetti P', 'Davoli T', 'Sironi C', 'Amati B', 'Pelicci PG', 'Colombo E']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleolus/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*metabolism', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/*metabolism']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/08/09 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['jcb.200711040 [pii]', '10.1083/jcb.200711040 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2008 Jul 14;182(1):19-26. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200711040.,,,PMC2447890,,,['J Cell Biol. 2008 Jul 14;182(1):7-9.

Here, we show that histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) knockdown reduces the size and the number of the PML NBs in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). HDAC7 coexpression stimulates PML sumoylation independent of its HDAC activity. Furthermore, HDAC7 associates with the E2 SUMO ligase, Ubc9, and stimulates PML sumoylation in vitro, suggesting that it possesses a SUMO E3 ligase-like activity to promote PML sumoylation. Importantly, HDAC7 knockdown inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced PML sumoylation and the formation of PML NBs in HUVECs. These results demonstrate a novel function of HDAC7 and provide a regulatory mechanism of PML sumoylation.","['Gao, Chengzhuo', 'Ho, Chun-Chen', 'Reineke, Erin', 'Lam, Minh', 'Cheng, Xiwen', 'Stanya, Kristopher J', 'Liu, Yu', 'Chakraborty, Sharmistha', 'Shih, Hsiu-Ming', 'Kao, Hung-Ying']","['Gao C', 'Ho CC', 'Reineke E', 'Lam M', 'Cheng X', 'Stanya KJ', 'Liu Y', 'Chakraborty S', 'Shih HM', 'Kao HY']","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080714,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC7 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Small Ubiquitin-Related Modifier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00874-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00874-08 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Sep;28(18):5658-67. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00874-08.

Causality was assessed using World Health Organization criteria. Clinical characteristics, management, and resolution were examined. RESULTS: In 70 reported cases, 50% of patients were female and the median age was 57 years. Hydroxyurea was implicated in 51% of cases. All cases had pathognomonic (76%) or compatible (24%) cutaneous findings. Hydroxyurea cases lacked myositis, but myositis was described in 79.4% of nonhydroxyurea cases. Drug causality was probable (25.7%) or possible (74.3%), but not certain in any case. Most patients had underlying pathology associated with DM (44% had malignancy; 16% had rheumatoid arthritis). Of the sample, 84.3% had improvement of DM after discontinuation of the drug. LIMITATIONS: Case reports may emphasize unusual findings.

Apart from its capacity to lower cholesterol plasma levels and to protect against cardiovascular disease, simvastatin induces apoptosis in various cancer cells. We have generated human Namalwa Burkitt lymphoma cells that display general apoptosis resistance and hyperproliferation due to increased expression and proteolytic activity of 26S proteasomes in response to continuous treatment of the cells with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. In these cells, simvastatin does not inhibit proteasome activity, but induces apoptosis, G2/M cell cycle arrest and accumulation of p21(Waf1/Cip1), and effectively inhibits hyperproliferation. These effects are reversed by the addition of GGPP. GGPP-dependent plasma membrane localization of the small GTPase RhoA that is required for RhoA-mediated oncogenic signaling is completely inhibited by simvastatin. Finally, bortezomib but not simvastatin induces accumulation and stabilization of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, which is known to confer resistance to apoptosis in cancer cells. Thus, simvastatin overcomes bortezomib-induced apoptosis resistance by inhibiting synthesis of GGPP and disrupting a GGPP-dependent survival pathway.","['Fuchs, Dominik', 'Berges, Carsten', 'Opelz, Gerhard', 'Daniel, Volker', 'Naujokat, Cord']","['Fuchs D', 'Berges C', 'Opelz G', 'Daniel V', 'Naujokat C']","['Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Im Neuenheimer Feld 305, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080714,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)', 'N21T0D88LX (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Boronic Acids/pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology', 'Simvastatin/*pharmacology', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/metabolism']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(08)01342-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Sep 19;374(2):309-14. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.07.012.

In this report, we have determined the effects of growth factor stimulation on LIF receptor (LIFR) expression and signal transduction in the human neuroblastoma cell line NBFL. We show here that stimulation of NBFL cells with either epidermal growth factor or fibroblast growth factor decreases the level of LIFR in an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk)1/2-dependent manner and that this down-regulation is due to an increase in the apparent rate of lysosomal LIFR degradation. Growth factor-induced decreases in LIFR level inhibit both LIF-stimulated phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and LIFR-mediated gene induction. We also show that Ser1044 of LIFR, which we have previously shown to be phosphorylated by Erk1/2, is required for the inhibitory effects of growth factors. Neurons are exposed to varying combinations and concentrations of growth factors and cytokines that influence their growth, development, differentiation, and repair in vivo. These findings demonstrate that LIFR expression and signaling in neuroblastoma cells can be regulated by growth factors that are potent activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and thus illustrate a fundamental mechanism that underlies crosstalk between receptor tyrosine kinase and neuropoietic cytokine signaling pathways.","['Port, Martha D', 'Laszlo, George S', 'Nathanson, Neil M']","['Port MD', 'Laszlo GS', 'Nathanson NM']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080704,England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptor Cross-Talk/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/*biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['JNC5535 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05535.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 2008 Aug;106(4):1941-51. doi: 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05535.x.

To address this, we compared two systems of IL-12 therapy that elicit protective immune responses against the murine acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cell line, 70Z/3. These systems differ in the method of IL-12 administration and ultimately result in leukaemia clearance by distinct mechanisms, emphasizing the importance of treatment vehicle. Injecting low-dose IL-12 was sufficient to elicit long-term protective immunity against an established leukaemia burden, mediated by both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells. These findings agree with the standard model of IL-12 activity. We compared this protocol to a cell-based approach in which a novel lentiviral vector (LV) expressing murine IL-12 was created, 70Z/3 cells transduced, and clones selected that stably secrete different amounts of IL-12. We found that only a small proportion (1%) of IL-12 secreting cells were required for rejection but that the amount of IL-12 produced per cell was critical for successful therapy. Importantly, the levels of IL-12 required were found to be higher than the levels reported to date in the human clinical trial literature. We found that the cell-based approach led to protective immunity that was both long-term and specific but dependent primarily on a CD4(+) cellular subset alone. Our results highlight that the mode of IL-12 delivery has a distinct impact on the immune response initiated, leading to leukaemia clearance by disparate mechanisms. We also establish a new and critical parameter, IL-12 production/cell, which may have significant implications for future therapeutic design.","['Labbe, Alain', 'Nelles, Megan', 'Walia, Jagdeep', 'Jia, Lintao', 'Furlonger, Caren', 'Nonaka, Takahiro', 'Medin, Jeffrey A', 'Paige, Christopher J']","['Labbe A', 'Nelles M', 'Walia J', 'Jia L', 'Furlonger C', 'Nonaka T', 'Medin JA', 'Paige CJ']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Departments of Immunology.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Medical Biophysics.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Medical Biophysics.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Departments of Immunology.', 'Medical Biophysics.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,J Cell Mol Med,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,101083777,['187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice']",2008/07/16 09:00,2010/07/20 06:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00412.x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Mol Med. 2009 Aug;13(8B):1962-1976. doi: 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00412.x.,,,PMC6512371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T cell tolerance, essential to prevent autoimmunity, must therefore be cautiously circumvented to generate cytotoxic T cell responses against these targets. Our strategy uses DNA fusion vaccines to activate high levels of peptide-specific CTL. Key foreign sequences from tetanus toxin activate tolerance-breaking CD4(+) T cell help. Candidate MHC class I-binding tumor peptide sequences are fused to the C terminus for optimal processing and presentation. To model performance against a leukemia-associated antigen in a tolerized setting, we constructed a fusion vaccine encoding an immunodominant CTL epitope derived from Friend murine leukemia virus gag protein (FMuLV(gag)) and vaccinated tolerant FMuLV(gag)-transgenic (gag-Tg) mice. Vaccination with the construct induced epitope-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD8(+) T cells in normal and gag-Tg mice. The frequency and avidity of activated cells were reduced in gag-Tg mice, and no autoimmune injury resulted. However, these CD8(+) T cells did exhibit gag-specific cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Also, epitope-specific CTL killed FBL-3 leukemia cells expressing endogenous FMuLV(gag) antigen and protected against leukemia challenge in vivo. These results demonstrate a simple strategy to engage anti-microbial T cell help to activate epitope-specific polyclonal CD8(+) T cell responses from a residual tolerized repertoire.","['Rice, Jason', 'Dossett, Michelle L', 'Ohlen, Claes', 'Buchan, Sarah L', 'Kendall, Timothy J', 'Dunn, Stuart N', 'Stevenson, Freda K', 'Greenberg, Philip D']","['Rice J', 'Dossett ML', 'Ohlen C', 'Buchan SL', 'Kendall TJ', 'Dunn SN', 'Stevenson FK', 'Greenberg PD']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, UK.

New indications, but not robust evidence.",91-4,,"(1) Imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was first marketed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia and some gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Its indications have gradually expanded over the years. (2) There is no consensus treatment for adults with Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In a trial comparing imatinib versus chemotherapy as initial treatment for 55 patients, the haematological response rate was higher with imatinib. Non-comparative trials provided haematological response rates of about 90%, but it is not known whether or not this translates into a survival advantage. In three non-comparative trials including patients with relapsed or refractory disease after chemotherapy, 50% of patients showed a survival time of at least 7 months. In the absence of any direct comparisons, we do not know if this represents an improvement over the results obtained with the best palliative care. (3) The only potential cure for myelodysplastic syndromes is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation but this is not always feasible. Some myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with myeloproliferation and PDGFR gene rearrangements; imatinib is the first drug available for these patients. The manufacturer has compiled data on 55 patients treated with imatinib. Most patients had a favourable haematological response, but no survival data were published. (4) The severity of the hypereosinophilic syndrome is highly variable. Forms associated with FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha gene rearrangements have a poor prognosis. Clinical evaluation of imatinib in this setting is based on a compilation of data concerning 176 treated patients. The haematological response rate was high in patients with the mutant gene, but it is not known whether this translated into increased survival. (5) Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare form of mainly localised skin cancer. Treatment is based on surgical excision but relapses are frequent. In one series, 9 out of 12 patients treated with imatinib had at least a partial tumour response, making surgical excision possible in 3 cases.

In the current study, the authors addressed this question by matching MS patients with analogous AML patients and comparing their clinical outcomes. METHODS: Twenty-three consecutive patients with MS and 1720 consecutive patients with AML were identified who presented at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center from 1990 to 2004. All AML patients and 16 MS patients received cytarabine plus idarubicin or fludarabine as induction remission therapy. Treated MS patients and AML patients were matched according to cytogenetics, age, Zubrod performance status, and time of treatment. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier analyses. RESULTS: Complete response rates were 69% in patients with MS and 57% in patients with AML (P = .45). The respective 2-year EFS and OS rates were 32% and 18% (P = .08) and 43% and 29% (P = .11). Matches were identified for 14 MS patients who were paired repeatedly with 91 AML patients to produce 94 matches (3 AML patients were matched twice). EFS was longer in 56 MS pair mates, shorter in 26 pair mates, and similar in 12 pair mates (P = .01; Fisher exact test). OS analyses yielded similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-AML therapy was highly effective in patients with nonleukemic MS. The results from this study emphasize the need to treat patients who have nonleukemic MS with AML-type therapy.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Wen, Sijin', 'Keating, Michael J', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Brandt, Mark', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Estey, Elihu']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Wen S', 'Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Brandt M', 'Pierce S', 'Freireich EJ', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Estey E']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

We studied the antioxidant status of children from the two groups and hypothesized that the antioxidant status will differ in concert with their treatment. PROCEDURE: The antioxidant status in plasma of seven ALL children and that of six children treated for different solid tumors, in regard to the different treatment regimen, was compared with healthy controls. These samples were taken during therapy, just before the next cyclophosphamide treatment, to determine the accumulative oxidative stress. RESULTS: Children from the ALL group (n = 7) had significantly lower thiol plasma levels than controls (P < 0.01) and their antioxidant capacity as measured by the ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) was significantly lower (P < 0.01). These parameters were normal in the solid tumors group (n = 6) but plasma antioxidant capacity as measured by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay was significantly lower (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Both groups had impaired plasma antioxidant status. The higher oxidative stress of children with ALL is associated with the protocol for treating ALL which is much more aggressive and frequent than that of the solid tumors. The lower antioxidant status in plasma with ALL children is probably associated with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) as indicated by the decrease of the antioxidant activity. This oxidative stress may lead to cell death or greater sensitivity of the tumor cell to therapy, with better outcome for pediatric patients with ALL.","['Mazor, Dalia', 'Abucoider, Abed', 'Meyerstein, Naomi', 'Kapelushnik, Joseph']","['Mazor D', 'Abucoider A', 'Meyerstein N', 'Kapelushnik J']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Experimental Hematology Laboratory, Physiology Department, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel. daliama@bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antioxidants/analysis/*metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*blood/physiopathology', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/physiopathology', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/blood']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/10/08 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21665 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Nov;51(5):613-5. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21665.,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Association with the presence of congenital anomalies has been noted in some studies. In this study, we describe and quantify the association between congenital anomalies and childhood cancer. PROCEDURE: Cases from the Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey (NorCAS) and the Northern Region Young Persons Malignant Disease Registry (NRYPMDR) were matched using four key variables: surname at birth, date of birth, postcode at birth, and infant gender. All potential matches were checked manually. A second match was performed for children with matched birth dates, postcodes and gender but different surnames, to identify children whose surname at diagnosis was not the same as at birth. RESULTS: Thirty-nine children with a congenital anomaly and a diagnosis of cancer were identified from a cohort of 599,290 children born during 1985-2001. There was an almost threefold overall increased risk of malignancy among these children (RR = 2.9; 95% CI 2.1, 3.9), particularly of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (RR = 2.7; 95% CI 1.5, 5.0), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (RR = 22.0; 95% CI 12.1, 40.0), other leukaemia (RR = 7.5; 95% CI 1.3, 43.6) and lymphomas (RR = 5.3; 95% CI 2.4, 12.0).

It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that these defects also contribute to degeneration of post-mitotic neurons under certain conditions. The gene for ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a prototype for this dual mechanism of action, with loss-of-function mutations causing not only selective degeneration of cerebellar neurons but also increased susceptibility to breast cancer and hematologic malignancy. Increased dosage of amyloid precursor protein in Down syndrome (trisomy 21) predisposes to dementia of Alzheimer type and may also contribute to acute leukemia and transient myeloproliferative disorder. The gene parkin, loss-of-function mutations in which account for about half of cases of early-onset Parkinson disease, has been identified as a candidate tumor suppressor gene by several groups. Parkin is deleted or downregulated in several tumor types, and its re-expression sensitizes derivative cell lines to inhibitors of cell-cycle progression. The overlap of molecular pathways implicated in cancer and neurodegeneration challenges long-held notions about differentiated cellular states and may open the door to novel therapeutic approaches to both groups of disorders.","['Staropoli, John F']",['Staropoli JF'],"['Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Gray-Jackson 249, MGH, 55 Fruit St Boston, MA 02114-2696, USA. jstaropoli@partners.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Bioessays,"BioEssays : news and reviews in molecular, cellular and developmental biology",8510851,"['0 (Amyloid)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amyloid/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', '*DNA Repair', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Down Syndrome/genetics/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurodegenerative Diseases/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neurons/metabolism', 'Parkinson Disease/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bies.20784 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioessays. 2008 Aug;30(8):719-27. doi: 10.1002/bies.20784.,90,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that newborn granule cells of the adult hippocampus are postsynaptic targets of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but evidence of synapse formation by the axons of these cells is still lacking. By combining retroviral expression of green fluorescent protein in adult-born neurons of the mouse dentate gyrus with immuno-electron microscopy, we found output synapses that were formed by labeled terminals on appropriate target cells in the CA3 area and the hilus. Furthermore, retroviral expression of channelrhodopsin-2 allowed us to light-stimulate newborn granule cells and identify postsynaptic target neurons by whole-cell recordings in acute slices.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are a promising class of targeted anticancer agents and induce apoptosis in cancer cells by largely unknown mechanisms. We report here a novel post-transcriptional modification, acetylation, of PML. PML exists as an acetylated protein in HeLa cells, and its acetylation is enhanced by coexpression of p300 or treatment with a HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A. Increased PML acetylation is associated with increased sumoylation of PML in vitro and in vivo. PML is involved in trichostatin A-induced apoptosis and PML with an acetylation-defective mutation shows an inability to mediate apoptosis, suggesting the importance of PML acetylation.

Several lines of evidence suggest that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) malignant B cells resemble antigen-experienced and activated B cells. In the present study, we investigated the expression of transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1, CD71), one of the ""classical"" markers up-regulated upon B-cell activation, and TfR2, a novel receptor for transferrin, in peripheral blood CD19+ B cells from ten healthy individuals and 76 patients with CLL so as to gain insight into potential disease-related differences in underlying regulatory mechanisms. Marked differences in the production and expression of these receptors were detected in malignant but not in normal B cells. Specifically, TfR1 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in comparison to TfR2, both in normal and malignant B cells. Furthermore, discrepancies between TfR mRNA and protein expression were observed in CLL; in contrast, mRNA and protein expression levels were generally concordant in normal B cells. Exposure to actinomycin D decreased TfR1 and TfR2 mRNA levels in normal CD19+ B cells but had no effect on CLL malignant cells. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had opposing effects in normal vs. CLL malignant B cells: thus, TfR1 and TfR2 mRNA levels were increased in normal B cells, whereas they were unaffected or even suppressed in CLL malignant B cells. These results allude to differential regulation of TfR1 and TfR2 expression in normal B cells vs. CLL. In normal B cells, transcriptional mechanisms exert a critical control over TfR1 and TfR2 expression, whereas in CLL post-transcriptional mechanisms seem to play a complementary and perhaps more important role. This type of control appears to be especially suited for modulation of genes implicated in proliferation of activated cells, like CLL malignant B cells.","['Chiotoglou, Ioanna', 'Smilevska, Tatjana', 'Samara, Maria', 'Likousi, Sophia', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Athanasiadou, Ioanna', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Samara, Stavroula', 'Laoutaris, Nikolaos', 'Vamvakopoulos, Nikolaos', 'Anagnostopoulos, Achilles', 'Fassas, Athanasios', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Kollia, Panagoula']","['Chiotoglou I', 'Smilevska T', 'Samara M', 'Likousi S', 'Belessi C', 'Athanasiadou I', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Samara S', 'Laoutaris N', 'Vamvakopoulos N', 'Anagnostopoulos A', 'Fassas A', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Kollia P']","['Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, School of Medicine, University of Thessaly, 41222 Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080714,United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD71 antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (TFR2 protein, human)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/*chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis/genetics', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1079-9796(08)00103-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2008 Sep-Oct;41(2):203-9. doi: 10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.05.003.

Nevertheless, the role and safety of this antibody target-therapy in first-line chemotherapy in patients younger than 65 years has not yet been defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The primary goal of this prospective phase II pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety profile of FLAI plus GO as induction regimen. Thirty consecutive AML patients were included. All patients were younger than 65 with a median age of 53 years and CD33 expression exceeded 20% in all cases. The M/F ratio was 16/14 and 21/30 (70%) of patients were poor-risk at diagnosis. The induction regimen (FLAI-GO) included fludarabine (30mg/m(2)) and Ara-C (2g/m(2)) on days 1-5, idarubicin (10mg/m(2)) on days 1, 3, and 5 and GO (3mg/m(2)) on day 6. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) was planned for all high risk AML patients in first complete remission (CR) after consolidation with intermediate doses of Ara-C and idarubicin (IDAC-IDA). Cytogenetic, multidrug-resistance phenotype, FLT3 mutation status, and WT1 quantitative expression analyses were performed at diagnosis in all patients. WT1 expression and cytogenetic (in positive cases) analyses were performed after induction to detect and follow minimal residual disease. RESULTS: Patients were evaluated for response rate, treatment-related adverse events, overall survival and relapse free survival. After induction with FLAI-GO, CR rate was 90% (26 of 29 evaluable pts); one patient achieved partial remission and two were resistant. There was only one case of death during induction (DDI). After FLAI-GO, the mean value of WT1 dropped from 4200+/-2777 copies/10(4)ABL to 192+/-399 copies/10(4)ABL. The toxicity of FLAI-GO was acceptable; 57% of patients experienced transient and reversible GO infusion-related adverse events (especially fever and chills), but no cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred during CHT or after HSCT. After a median follow-up of 16 months (range 2-25), 24/30 (80%) patients are alive (24/24 in CR). The probability of 1-year OS and RFS was 90 and 85%, respectively. Allogeneic and autologus HSCT was performed in 19 (63%) and 4 (13%) patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that FLAI-GO is an effective and well tolerated induction regimen for CD33 positive AML patients younger than 65 years, with a high complete response rate, favourable safety profile, low DDI. These results encourage the testing of this regimen in a multicenter prospective trial.","['Candoni, Anna', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Toffoletti, Eleonora', 'Chiarvesio, Alexia', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Piccaluga, Pier Paolo', 'Michelutti, Angela', 'Simeone, Erica', 'Damiani, Daniela', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Fanin, Renato']","['Candoni A', 'Martinelli G', 'Toffoletti E', 'Chiarvesio A', 'Tiribelli M', 'Malagola M', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Michelutti A', 'Simeone E', 'Damiani D', 'Russo D', 'Fanin R']","['Division of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Clinical and Morphological Research, University Hospital, Udine, Italy. candoni.anna@aoud.sanita.fvg.it']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080714,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Filgrastim', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Remission Induction', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2008/07/16 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00250-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Dec;32(12):1800-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.011.

To study this difference in MSV expression, second-generation MSV from the S + L - human cells is recloned in dog, mink, and back into mouse cells. Heterologous host dog and mink S + L - cell clones, like human S + L - cell clones, fail to release viral-type reverse transcriptase into culture supernatant fractions. All second-generation homologous mouse S + L - cell clones again release viral reverse transcriptase in supernatant fractions, indicating that the MSV genome has not been altered in this function. Using (dT)(12-18)-cellulose and phosphocellulose chromatography of cellular polymerase preparations, no intracellular buildup of unreleased murine reverse transcriptase is detected in the S + L - clones. The data presented here suggest that the MSV genome is defective in the information for the viral core protein RDDP.

In malignant hematological disease, p63 expression has been reported in 22% of follicular lymphoma, about 35% of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 23% of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in some cases of blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare disease that accounts for less than 5% of all cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. There is little information concerning p63 expression in this specific type of lymphoma. In some cases, the morphological and phenotypic features between anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma are similar, making this differential diagnosis challenging. We studied p63 expression using a tissue microarray approach in 154 cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, including 38% anaplastic large cell kinase positive and 62% anaplastic large cell kinase negative, and 58 Hodgkin's lymphoma cases. Sixty-eight cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (44%) showed p63 nuclear positivity (41% of anaplastic large cell kinase positive and 47% of anaplastic large cell kinase negative). Of 130 cases of systemic-anaplastic large cell lymphoma, 42% showed p63 positivity. The neoplastic cells expressed p63 in 38% of the cases of CD45-negative/anaplastic large cell kinase-negative null cell-type anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a subgroup that offers the most difficulties in the differential diagnosis with classical Hodgkin's lymphoma. In contrast, none of the cases of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma demonstrated any p63 expression. These results demonstrate that p63 protein expression is frequently expressed in a subset of anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases and may be used as a potential tool in the differential diagnosis between anaplastic large cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Gualco, Gabriela', 'Weiss, Lawrence M', 'Bacchi, Carlos E']","['Gualco G', 'Weiss LM', 'Bacchi CE']","['Consultoria em Patologia, 18602-010 Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080711,United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CKAP4 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymph Nodes/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Anaplastic/diagnosis/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Tissue Array Analysis']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/09/24 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/02/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0046-8177(08)00115-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.humpath.2008.02.016 [doi]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2008 Oct;39(10):1505-10. doi: 10.1016/j.humpath.2008.02.016.

Metastable expression of virus functions in revertants retransformed by murine sarcoma virus.,217-29,,"3T3FL cells transformed by the Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV) (sarcoma positive, leukemia negative, S+L- cells) segregate spontaneous flat revertants. These S-L- revertants do not release MSV upon superinfection with MuLV but are susceptible to a second cycle of single-hit MSV transformation. The behavior and nature of second-cycle MSV transformed revertants were followed by successive clonal generations. The second transformation by MSV resulted in a number of metastable states. The simplest of these was a tranformed S+L- like state, which in contrast to parental S+L- cells, was also inducible by halogenated pyrimidines. A second type consisted of a transformed S+L- clone which could give rise to a secondary flat S-L- clone, which when followed over several generations could turn again into a stable S+L- type cell. Thus an MSV genome can persist in a nontransformed cell in a nonrescuable state. A third condition has been found in which a previously S+L- type MSV retransformed revertant began to produce infectious MSV with or without an atypical murine leukemia virus (MuLV). Other clonal sublines from a second cycle MSV transformed cell resulted in both a stable S+L- type line and a spontaneous MSV releaser line. The S+L- type retransformed cell resembled parental single cycle MSV transformed S+L- cells in that it contained MuLV group specific antigen(s), and C type particles. Some second cycle MSV transformed S+L- cells produced infectious MSV on chemical induction. No second-cycle reversion was ever observed, if both the first and the second infecting genomes were Moloney-MSV. The nature of the atypical MuLV was examined in terms of host range, growth potential, and antigenicity. This MuLV was at times released with an apparent excess of MSV, yet if eleven weekly blind passages of such a virus stock were made in S+L- cells, replicating MuLV was found in titers similar to the MSV content. This atypical virus replicated in mouse cells, less in rat cells, but not at all in human or cat cells. Neutralization revealed that it was closely related to the Moloney type of MuLV. The above observations are compatible with the interpretation that the second cycle of MSV transformation destabilizes cellular controls over the transforming genome.","['Fischinger, P J', 'Nomura, S', 'Tuttle-Fuller, N', 'Joyce Dunn, K']","['Fischinger PJ', 'Nomura S', 'Tuttle-Fuller N', 'Joyce Dunn K']","['Viral Leukemia and Lymphoma Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20014, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,,,,1974/05/01 00:00,1974/05/01 00:01,['1974/05/01 00:00'],"['1974/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '1974/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1974/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1974/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['0042-6822(74)90217-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Virology. 1974 May;59(1):217-29.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Presence of SUV39H1 enhances Evi1 transcriptional repression in a dose dependent manner. In addition, Evi1 also interacts with another histone methyltransferase, G9a, but not with SET9.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine were used to detect proliferation and cell cycle of CD8+T cells treated with dasatinib, respectively. Frequency and function of viral and leukemia-antigen-specific CD8+T cells from healthy donors were measured by tetramer staining and ELISPOT assay. Western blotting analysis was performed to detect T-cell receptor (TCR), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Src signaling events in T cells treated with dasatinib or imatinib. RESULTS: Dasatinib inhibited proliferation of CD8+T cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with lower secretion of interferon-gamma and granzyme B, as well as with arrest of CD8+T cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle. Inhibition of CD8+T cells was proven for blood samples from a patient under dasatinib medication when compared with their T-cell status without dasatinib. Western blotting confirmed that these effects were mediated through downregulation of the phosphorylation level of molecules from the TCR and the NF-kappaB signaling transduction cascade. Dasatinib proved to be more potent than imatinib on Src and TCR signaling events in Jurkat T cells. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that dasatinib impaired proliferation and function of CD8+T cells via TCR and NF-kappaB signaling events without inducing apoptosis. Therefore, dasatinib might alter the graft-vs-leukemia effect and the graft-vs-host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation sustained by CD8+T cells. Dasatinib might also be used as a novel immunosuppressant agent.","['Fei, Fei', 'Yu, Yingzhe', 'Schmitt, Anita', 'Rojewski, Markus Thomas', 'Chen, Baoan', 'Greiner, Jochen', 'Gotz, Marlies', 'Guillaume, Philippe', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Schmitt, Michael']","['Fei F', 'Yu Y', 'Schmitt A', 'Rojewski MT', 'Chen B', 'Greiner J', 'Gotz M', 'Guillaume P', 'Dohner H', 'Bunjes D', 'Schmitt M']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080710,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/drug effects/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/drug effects/*immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*immunology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Humans', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2008/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00224-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1297-308. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.05.002.

In many patients, the transforming mutation FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha and the related CHIC2 deletion are found. The respective oncoprotein, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, is considered to play a major role in malignant cell growth in CEL. The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor imatinib (STI571) has been described to counteract the TK activity of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha in most patients. However, not all patients with CEL show a response to imatinib. Therefore, several attempts have been made to identify other TK inhibitors that counteract growth of neoplastic eosinophils. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We provide evidence that dasatinib, a multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, blocks the growth and survival of EOL-1, an eosinophil leukemia cell line carrying FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. RESULTS: The effects of dasatinib on proliferation of EOL-1 cells were dose-dependent, with an IC50 of 0.5 to 1 nM, which was found to be in the same range when compared to IC50 values produced with imatinib. Dasatinib was also found to induce apoptosis in EOL-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50: 1-10 nM). The apoptosis-inducing effects of dasatinib on EOL-1 cells were demonstrable by light microscopy, flow cytometry, and in a TUNEL assay. In Western blot experiments, dasatinib completely blocked the phosphorylation of FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha in EOL-1 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib inhibits the growth of leukemic eosinophils through targeting of the disease-related oncoprotein FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha. Based on this observation, dasatinib may be considered as a new interesting treatment option for patients with CEL.","['Baumgartner, Christian', 'Gleixner, Karoline V', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Ferenc, Veronika', 'Gruze, Alexander', 'Remsing Rix, Lily L', 'Bennett, Keiryn L', 'Samorapoompichit, Puchit', 'Lee, Francis Y', 'Pickl, Winfried F', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Sillaber, Christian', 'Superti-Furga, Giulio', 'Valent, Peter']","['Baumgartner C', 'Gleixner KV', 'Peter B', 'Ferenc V', 'Gruze A', 'Remsing Rix LL', 'Bennett KL', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Lee FY', 'Pickl WF', 'Esterbauer H', 'Sillaber C', 'Superti-Furga G', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (FIP1L1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/enzymology/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'mRNA Cleavage and Polyadenylation Factors/drug effects/*physiology']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00206-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1244-53. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.017.

Expression of beta-catenin was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in formalin-fixed decalcified bone marrow biopsy specimens from 52 chronic myeloproliferative disorder cases and 6 nonchronic myeloproliferative disorder bone marrows as controls. The frequency of moderate to strong beta-catenin staining of megakaryocytes was significantly higher in polycythemia vera cases and in essential thrombocythemia cases than in chronic myelogenous leukemia cases (polycythemia vera versus chronic myelogenous leukemia, P = .002345, Fisher exact; and essential thrombocythemia versus chronic myelogenous leukemia, P = .002288), chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis cases (polycythemia vera versus chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, P = .006707 and essential thrombocythemia versus chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis, P = .006932) or control cases (polycythemia vera versus control, P = .010489 and essential thrombocythemia versus control, P = .0113120). The erythroid and myeloid lineages showed absent to weak beta-catenin staining in most cases. In conclusion, these results indicate that the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway may have a role in megakaryocytopoiesis in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors that impact long-term mental health outcomes of this population almost 20 years after the disaster. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: In-person interviews were conducted with 381 men and women from two geographic areas of differing radiation contamination within Belarus. Participants completed surveys of demographics, psychosocial factors and psychological distress. Individual-level characteristics were combined with household-level measures of radiation contamination exposure and family characteristics to create multilevel predictive models of psychological distress. RESULTS: Between-household effects accounted for 20% of variability in depression and anxiety scores, but only 8% of variability in somatization scores. Degree of chronic daily stressors showed a significant positive relationship with psychological distress, whereas mastery/controllability showed a significant inverse relationship with distress. At household level, perceived family problems, but not level of residential radiation contamination, was the best predictor of distress. CONCLUSIONS: Multilevel modelling indicates that long-term psychological distress among Belarusians affected by the Chernobyl disaster is better predicted by stress-moderating psychosocial factors present in one's daily life than by level of residential radiation contamination.","['Beehler, G P', 'Baker, J A', 'Falkner, K', 'Chegerova, T', 'Pryshchepava, A', 'Chegerov, V', 'Zevon, M', 'Bromet, E', 'Havenaar, J', 'Valdismarsdottir, H', 'Moysich, K B']","['Beehler GP', 'Baker JA', 'Falkner K', 'Chegerova T', 'Pryshchepava A', 'Chegerov V', 'Zevon M', 'Bromet E', 'Havenaar J', 'Valdismarsdottir H', 'Moysich KB']","['Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA. gregory.beehler@va.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,Netherlands,Public Health,Public health,0376507,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/complications/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Mental Health/*statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', '*Power Plants', 'Psychology', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Republic of Belarus/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Stress, Psychological/*epidemiology', 'Time Factors', 'Ukraine', 'Young Adult']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/12/24 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0033-3506(08)00123-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.puhe.2008.04.017 [doi]']",ppublish,Public Health. 2008 Nov;122(11):1239-49. doi: 10.1016/j.puhe.2008.04.017.

In preclinical studies, strong anti-cancer activities against breast cancer, prostate cancer, and leukemia were reported. It also inhibited the proliferation of cultured human endothelial cells, suggestive of an anti-angiogenic activity. Since ZOL has the tendency to accumulate in bone, we investigated the effect of ZOL on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which originate from the bone marrow, and play important roles in angiogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 7 d to differentiate into EPCs. Cells were treated without/with ZOL or with geranylgeraniol (GGOH). Their endothelial phenotype was confirmed by the expression of CD144 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and the tube-like formation ability on Matrigel (Becton Dickinson, Bedford, MA). Annexin V/propidium iodide staining was used to analyze apoptosis. RESULTS: ZOL treatment, even at low doses, from d 2 to 7 of culture resulted in impaired EPC differentiation and could be restored by co-treatment with GGOH. On the other hand, treatment of putative EPCs with ZOL at concentrations higher than 10 mum resulted in induction of apoptosis. CONCLUSION: ZOL dose-dependently inhibited the differentiation of EPCs, the effect being observed even at low drug levels. At high concentrations, ZOL also induced the apoptotic death of putative EPCs. Since GGOH restored the inhibitory effect of ZOL on EPCs differentiation, the effect of ZOL appears to be dependent on the inhibition of prenylation of small-G-proteins. From these findings, we conclude that ZOL could be a potential anticancer agent by inhibiting angiogenesis.","['Yamada, Jun', 'Tsuno, Nelson H', 'Kitayama, Joji', 'Tsuchiya, Takeshi', 'Yoneyama, Satomi', 'Asakage, Masahiro', 'Okaji, Yurai', 'Shuno, Yasutaka', 'Nishikawa, Takeshi', 'Tanaka, Junichiro', 'Takahashi, Koki', 'Nagawa, Hirokazu']","['Yamada J', 'Tsuno NH', 'Kitayama J', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Yoneyama S', 'Asakage M', 'Okaji Y', 'Shuno Y', 'Nishikawa T', 'Tanaka J', 'Takahashi K', 'Nagawa H']","['Department of Surgical Oncology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. jymda-tky@umin.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080229,United States,J Surg Res,The Journal of surgical research,0376340,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Diphosphonates)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (cadherin 5)', '6XC1PAD3KF (Zoledronic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Diphosphonates/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism', 'Zoledronic Acid']",2008/07/16 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2007/10/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]']","['S0022-4804(08)00055-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jss.2008.01.031 [doi]']",ppublish,J Surg Res. 2009 Jan;151(1):115-20. doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.01.031.

Silybin also acts as an iron chelator by binding Fe (III). The present study was undertaken to assess the biological effects of silybin on T leukemia cells in the presence or absence of iron and compare its effects with a well-known iron chelator; desferrioxamine. In these experiments, we studied the growth capacity of Jurkat while varying iron availability in the environment. Desferrioxamine significantly inhibited growth and proliferation of Jurkat cells, blocking treated cells in the G0/G1 phase and inducing apoptosis. In contrast, silybin showed a bimodal effect, inducing cell proliferation at lower concentrations whereas inhibition of DNA synthesis and significant cell death was observed at higher concentrations. Chelation of Fe totally abrogated antiproliferative, cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of desferrioxamine on Jurkat cells. Conversely, the silybin-Fe complex had no appreciable effect on its antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities. The cytotoxic effect of desferrioxamine was also prevented in iron-loaded Jurkat cells; however, the effect of silybin on the growth and viability of iron-loaded cells was similar to the effect of its iron complex on untreated Jurkat cells. Despite the Fe chelating activity of silybin that suggests its possible application in chelation therapy of chronic iron overload, the biological effects of silybin on Jurkat cells are different than those of desferrioxamine, probably due to antioxidant activity of silybin, which causes pro-oxidant effect via iron-catalyzed oxidation with the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species.","['Gharagozloo, Marjan', 'Khoshdel, Zahra', 'Amirghofran, Zahra']","['Gharagozloo M', 'Khoshdel Z', 'Amirghofran Z']","['Department of Immunology, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080406,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (Silymarin)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deferoxamine/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/16 09:00,2008/10/25 09:00,['2008/07/16 09:00'],"['2007/06/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/16 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)00387-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.03.059 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Jul 28;589(1-3):1-7. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.03.059.

The design of future clinical trials are already incorporating novel prognostic markers such as IgVH, among others, as part of risk-adapted strategies aimed at improving treatment outcomes by tailoring the aggressiveness of the therapy proportional to disease risk.

METHODS: The authors analyzed 1915 patients with MDS who were referred from 1993 to 2005 (including those with CMML, secondary MDS, and MDS with prior therapy). Only 507 patients (26%) had primary MDS without prior therapy (ie, classifiable by the IPSS). Patients were divided randomly into a study group (n = 958) and a test group (n = 957). RESULTS.: A multivariate analysis of prognostic factors in the study group identified the following adverse, independent factors as continuous and categoric values (P<.001): poor performance, older age, thrombocytopenia, anemia, increased bone marrow blasts, leukocytosis, chromosome 7 or complex (>or=3) abnormalities, and prior transfusions. Cutoffs for anemia, thrombocytopenia and blasts, and cytogenetic subsets were different according to the IPSS. The new MDS prognostic model divided patients into 4 prognostic groups with significantly different outcomes. The model was validated in the test group. Applying the prognostic score of the new model within the 4 IPSS risk groups, overall, and in patients who had primary MDS without prior therapy was found to be highly prognostic in each subset. Applying the IPSS within each of the 4 risk groups of the new MDS model was not found to be prognostic. CONCLUSIONS: The new model accounts for duration of MDS and prior therapy. It is applicable to any patient with MDS at any time during the course of MDS.","['Kantarjian, Hagop', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Shan, Jianqin', 'Bennett, John M', 'List, Alan', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Sanz, Guillermo', 'Issa, Jean-Pierre', 'Freireich, Emil J', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Kantarjian H', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ravandi F', 'Cortes J', 'Shan J', 'Bennett JM', 'List A', 'Fenaux P', 'Sanz G', 'Issa JP', 'Freireich EJ', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Recently, we demonstrated distinct differences in gene expression between childhood T-LBL and T-ALL, but molecular pathogenesis and relevant protein expression patterns in T-LBL remain poorly understood. PROCEDURE: Children with T-LBL with disseminated disease were registered and treated on COG protocol 5971. Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was obtained at diagnosis for immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. We determined the pattern and intensity of staining for c-Myc, Skp2, Mib-1, p53, TCL-1, bcl-2, and bcl-6 proteins by IHC and c-Myc, p53, bcl-2, bcl-6, and TCR alpha/delta molecular alterations by FISH in 22 pediatric T-LBL cases. RESULTS: The majority of T-LBL samples expressed Mib-1 (59%) and c-Myc (77%) proteins in greater than 50% of the cells, but Skp2 (14%), p53 (14%), and bcl-2 (23%) expression was less common. FISH studies demonstrated 18% gains and 10% losses in c-Myc, 16% gains in p53, 12% gains and 6% losses in bcl-2, and 6% gains and 19% losses in bcl-6 with little direct correlation between the IHC and FISH studies. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood T-LBL is a highly proliferative tumor associated with enhanced expression of c-Myc protein, but without detectable c-Myc molecular alterations. FISH studies did not identify consistent etiologies of molecular dysregulation, and future studies with other molecular approaches may be required to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of childhood T-LBL.","['Smock, Kristi J', 'Nelson, Marilu', 'Tripp, Sheryl R', 'Sanger, Warren G', 'Abromowitch, Minnie', 'Cairo, Mitchell S', 'Perkins, Sherrie L']","['Smock KJ', 'Nelson M', 'Tripp SR', 'Sanger WG', 'Abromowitch M', 'Cairo MS', 'Perkins SL']","['Department of Pathology, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, ARUP Laboratories, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Medical Oncology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*classification/immunology/metabolism/*pathology']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21666 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Oct;51(4):489-94. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21666.,,"['U10 CA098413-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2712233,['NIHMS123020'],,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,"[""Children's Oncology Group""]",,,,,,,,

METHODS: The national registry-based case-control study ESCALE was carried out in France over the period 2003-2004. Population controls were frequency matched with the cases on age and gender. Maternal smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy and paternal smoking since before conception were reported by the mothers in a structured telephone questionnaire. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models closely adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 765 cases of acute leukemia (AL), 130 of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL), 165 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 1681 controls were included. Paternal smoking was significantly associated with childhood ALL (OR = 1.4 [1.1-1.7]), AML (OR = 1.5 [1.0-2.3]), Burkitt (OR = 2.0 [1.2-3.2]), and anaplastic large cell (OR = 3.2 [1.2-9.1]) NHL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 1999 to December 2006, 15 patients (seven male and eight female subjects, age range 7-52 years) with BCS uncontrolled by medical therapy were treated with TIPS placement. In seven cases BCS was idiopathic, in four it was caused by myeloproliferative disorders and in four by other disorders. One patient also had portal vein thrombosis. In 5/15 cases TIPS was created through a transcaval approach. Eight patients (53.4%) received a bare stent, and seven (46.6%) received a stent graft. The follow-up lasted a median of 29.4 (range 3.2-68) months. RESULTS: Technical success was achieved in all patients without major complications. TIPS was very effective in decreasing the portosystemic pressure gradient from 26.2+/-5.8 to 10+/-6.2 mmHg. All patients but two were alive at the time of writing. Acute leukaemia was the cause of the single early death and was unrelated to the procedure. The patient with portal vein thrombosis underwent thrombolysis before TIPS, but the vein occluded again after 3 weeks, and the patient died 6 months later. The other patients showed significant improvements in liver function, ascites and symptoms related to portal hypertension. Primary patency was 53.3%, and primary assisted patency was 93.3%. No patient required or was scheduled for liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: TIPS is an effective and safe treatment for BCS and may be considered a valuable alternative to traditional surgical portosystemic shunting or liver transplantation.","['Corso, R', 'Intotero, M', 'Solcia, M', 'Castoldi, M C', 'Rampoldi, A']","['Corso R', 'Intotero M', 'Solcia M', 'Castoldi MC', 'Rampoldi A']","['Interventional Radiology, Niguarda Hospital, Piazza Ospedale Maggiore 3, 20162 Milan, Italy. roccocorso@jumpy.it']","['eng', 'ita']",['Journal Article'],20080709,Italy,Radiol Med,La Radiologia medica,0177625,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Budd-Chiari Syndrome/diagnostic imaging/etiology/*surgery', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Portasystemic Shunt, Transjugular Intrahepatic', 'Radiography, Interventional']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2007/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11547-008-0288-z [doi]'],ppublish,Radiol Med. 2008 Aug;113(5):727-38. doi: 10.1007/s11547-008-0288-z.

Under steady-state conditions, mice lacking the inhibitory adaptor protein Lnk harbor an expanded HSC pool with enhanced self-renewal. We found that HSCs from Lnk-/- mice have an increased quiescent fraction, decelerated cell cycle kinetics, and enhanced resistance to repeat treatments with cytoablative 5-fluorouracil in vivo compared with WT HSCs. We further provide genetic evidence demonstrating that Lnk controls HSC quiescence and self-renewal, predominantly through Mpl. Consistent with this observation, Lnk-/- HSCs displayed potentiated activation of JAK2 specifically in response to TPO. Biochemical experiments revealed that Lnk directly binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues in JAK2 following TPO stimulation. Of note, the JAK2 V617F mutant, found at high frequencies in myeloproliferative diseases, retains the ability to bind Lnk. Therefore, we identified Lnk as a physiological negative regulator of JAK2 in stem cells and TPO/Mpl/JAK2/Lnk as a major regulatory pathway in controlling stem cell self-renewal and quiescence.","['Bersenev, Alexey', 'Wu, Chao', 'Balcerek, Joanna', 'Tong, Wei']","['Bersenev A', 'Wu C', 'Balcerek J', 'Tong W']","[""Division of Hematology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-4318, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lnk protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mpl protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*physiology', 'Homeostasis', 'Homozygote', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Janus Kinase 2/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin/physiology', 'Thrombopoietin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI35808 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Aug;118(8):2832-44. doi: 10.1172/JCI35808.,,"['K01 CA115679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL095675/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01-CA115679/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2447929,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four of the 93 proteins with nuclear localization formed subnuclear structures. Twelve of these localized to the nucleolus, and five at least partially localized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, which are known to suppress viral lytic infection. In addition, two proteins disrupted Cajal bodies, and 19 of the nuclear proteins significantly decreased the number of PML bodies per cell, including six that were shown to be SUMO-modified.

Although they are known to promote caspase-mediated apoptosis, it remains unclear whether caspase-independent cell death-inducing mechanisms are also triggered. Here we demonstrated that INNO-406, a second-generation Bcr-Abl TK inhibitor, induces programmed cell death (PCD) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell lines through both caspase-mediated and caspase-independent pathways. The latter pathways include caspase-independent apoptosis (CIA) and necrosis-like cell death (CIND), and the cell lines varied regarding which mechanism was elicited upon INNO-406 treatment. We also observed that the propensity toward CIA or CIND in cells was strongly associated with cellular dependency on apoptosome-mediated caspase activity. Cells that undergo CIND have a high apoptosome activity potential whereas cells that undergo CIA tend to have a lower potential. Moreover, we found that INNO-406 promotes autophagy. When autophagy was inhibited with chloroquine or gene knockdown of beclin1 by shRNA, INNO-406-induced cell death was enhanced, which indicates that the autophagic response of the tumor cells is protective. These findings suggest new insights into the biology and therapy of Bcr-Abl(+) leukemias.","['Kamitsuji, Y', 'Kuroda, J', 'Kimura, S', 'Toyokuni, S', 'Watanabe, K', 'Ashihara, E', 'Tanaka, H', 'Yui, Y', 'Watanabe, M', 'Matsubara, H', 'Mizushima, Y', 'Hiraumi, Y', 'Kawata, E', 'Yoshikawa, T', 'Maekawa, T', 'Nakahata, T', 'Adachi, S']","['Kamitsuji Y', 'Kuroda J', 'Kimura S', 'Toyokuni S', 'Watanabe K', 'Ashihara E', 'Tanaka H', 'Yui Y', 'Watanabe M', 'Matsubara H', 'Mizushima Y', 'Hiraumi Y', 'Kawata E', 'Yoshikawa T', 'Maekawa T', 'Nakahata T', 'Adachi S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080711,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NVW4Z03I9B (bafetinib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['cdd2008107 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.107 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Nov;15(11):1712-22. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.107.

In this study, hESCs ectopically expressing high and low levels of HoxB4 were obtained using lentiviral gene transfer. Quantification throughout differentiation revealed a steady increase in transcription levels from our constructs. The effects of the two expression levels of HoxB4 were compared regarding the differentiation potential into HSCs. High levels of HoxB4 expression correlated to an improved yield of cells expressing CD34, CD38, the stem cell leukemia gene, and vascular epithelium-cadherin. However, no improvement in myeloid cell maturation was observed, as determined by colony formation assays. In contrast, hESCs with low HoxB4 levels did not show any elevated hematopoietic development. In addition, we found that the total population of HoxB4-expressing cells, on both levels, decreased in developing embryoid bodies. Notably, a high HoxB4 expression in hESCs also seemed to interfere with the formation of germ layers after xenografting into immunodeficient mice. These data suggest that HoxB4-induced effects on hESC-derived HSCs are concentration-dependent during in vitro development and reduce proliferation of other cell types in vitro and in vivo. The application of the transcription factor HoxB4 during early hematopoiesis from hESCs might provide new means for regenerative medicine, allowing efficient differentiation and engraftment of genetically modified hESC clones. Our study highlights the importance of HoxB4 dosage and points to the need for experimental systems allowing controlled gene expression.

Its expression in leukemic blasts is coincident with a silenced wild-type (WT) MLL allele. We therefore generated mice expressing the Mll-PTD in the absence of Mll-WT. These Mll(PTD/-) mice die at birth unlike the normal life expectancy of Mll(PTD/WT), Mll(WT/-), and Mll(WT/WT) mice. Using Mll(WT/WT) fetal liver cells (FLC) as baseline, we compared Mll(PTD/-) with Mll(PTD/WT) FLC and found both had increased HoxA gene expression and granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming progenitor cells (CFU-GM); in contrast, only Mll(PTD/WT) FLC had increased pluripotent hemopoietic progenitors (CFU-GEMM). The similarities between Mll(PTD/WT) and Mll(PTD/-) mice suggest that the Mll-PTD mutation can up-regulate target genes in a dominant, gain-of-function fashion. The differences between these 2 genotypes suggest that in select tissues the Mll-PTD requires cooperation with the Mll-WT in the genesis of the observed abnormality.","['Dorrance, Adrienne M', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Chong, Anita', 'Pulley, Benjamin', 'Nemer, David', 'Guimond, Martin', 'Yuan, Weifeng', 'Chang, Dennis', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Caligiuri, Michael A']","['Dorrance AM', 'Liu S', 'Chong A', 'Pulley B', 'Nemer D', 'Guimond M', 'Yuan W', 'Chang D', 'Whitman SP', 'Marcucci G', 'Caligiuri MA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '157907-48-7 (HoxA protein)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Fetus', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', '*Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)59874-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-134338 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 15;112(6):2508-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-134338.

Here, we performed a side-by-side comparison of erlotinib and gefitinib effects on a broad spectrum of malignant myeloid cell lines, as well as on primary myeloblasts freshly purified from the bone marrow of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Both erlotinib and gefitinib induce apoptosis of a cell line (KG-1) that represents AML, and differentiation in another cell line (P39) derived from a patient with high-risk MDS. In this setting, erlotinib was more efficient than gefitinib. Erlotinib and gefitinib were equipotent in inducing apoptosis of primary CD34+ myeloblasts from MDS and AML patients, yet had no toxic effect on CD34+ progenitor cells from healthy donors. Although the response of individual MDS and AML patients in vitro was highly heterogeneous, the pro-apoptotic effects of erlotinib and gefitinib correlated significantly. These results suggest that erlotinib and gefitinib share a mechanistically related off-target effect that may be taken advantage of for the therapy of MDS and AML.","['Boehrer, Simone', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Galluzzi, Lorenzo', 'Tajeddine, Nicolas', 'Tailler, Maximilien', 'Gardin, Claude', 'de Botton, Stephane', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Kroemer, Guido']","['Boehrer S', 'Ades L', 'Galluzzi L', 'Tajeddine N', 'Tailler M', 'Gardin C', 'de Botton S', 'Fenaux P', 'Kroemer G']","['INSERM, U848, 94805 Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080709,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'S65743JHBS (Gefitinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Female', 'Gefitinib', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2008/07/12 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/07 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00355-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Dec 1;76(11):1417-25. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.024.

MLL has been fused to ELL exon 2 in all the previously reported MLL-ELL transcripts, which have always been associated with AML.

Bone marrow samples were obtained from 59 consecutive children with ALL. FISH detected a total of 63 abnormalities with the selected probes, 34 of which were related to the conventional cytogenetic results. The most common abnormality was the p16 deletion (22.8%), followed by MLL and ETV6/RUNX1 rearrangements (8.7%), and the BCR/ABL fusion was the least frequent (2.7%). The coexistence of two recurrent abnormalities with specific prognostic significance in the same patient was not found. A lesser proportion of the p16 deletion in T-ALL patients was observed, probably related to the low prevalence of this subtype in our population.

This interest arises for multiple reasons including the tight link between the integrity of PML nuclear bodies and several disease states and the impact of the PML protein and PML nuclear bodies on proliferation, apoptosis and viral infection. Unfortunately, an understanding of the molecular underpinnings of PML nuclear body function remains elusive. Here, a general overview of the PML field is provided and is extended to discuss whether some of the basic tenets of ""PML-ology"" are still valid. For instance, recent findings suggest that some components of PML nuclear bodies form bodies in the absence of the PML protein. Also, a new model for PML nuclear body function is proposed which provides a unifying framework for its effects on diverse biochemical pathways such as Akt signaling and the p53-Mdm2 axis. In this model, the PML protein acts as an inhibitor of gene expression post-transcriptionally via inhibiting a network node in the eIF4E RNA regulon. An example is given for how the PML RNA regulon model provided the basis for the development of a new anti-cancer strategy being tested in the clinic.","['Borden, Katherine L B']",['Borden KL'],"['Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H4M 1J6. katherine.borden@umontreal.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080618,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Inclusion Bodies/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/physiopathology', '*Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*RNA/genetics/metabolism', '*Regulon', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', '*Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(08)00237-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Nov;1783(11):2145-54. doi: 10.1016/j.bbamcr.2008.06.005.

The levels and the prognostic relevance of serum endostatin in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patient are not fully clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate serum levels of endostatin in acute myeloid leukemia patients before chemotherapy and after achieving complete remission and to correlate endostatin levels with patient outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples from 30 adult patients (22 males and eight females, median age 37, range 19-66 years) with AML had been taken before chemotherapy was administered. In addition 25 out of 30 patients were reinvestigated again at complete remission (CR). Ten samples from healthy normal persons of matched age and sex were evaluated as a reference control group. Serum endostatin levels were determined using enzyme linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA). Endostatin serum levels were not significantly different in the pre-treatment AML patients as compared to that in normal controls (p>0.05). In AML patients the baseline endostatin levels were significantly lower than at CR (p=0.001). RESULTS: No significant relation were detected between pre-treatment serum endostatin levels and age, peripheral blood white cell counts, platelet counts, bone marrow blast cell counts, blast cell distribution ratio or cytogenetic findings. The prognostic value of serum endostatin (sE) was also evaluated by dividing AML patients into high and low sE groups using the 75 percentile sE levels of the patients group as cutoff. The authors found that patients group in the high sE group survived for significantly longer time than those patients in the low sE group. CONCLUSION: Elevated endostatin levels at AML diagnosis is a good prognostic marker for patients' outcome. Wide scale study is recommended in order to establish the clinical value of this study.","['Aref, S', 'El-Sherbiny, M', 'Azmy, E', 'Goda, T', 'Selim, T', 'El-Refaie, M', 'Twafik, E']","['Aref S', 'El-Sherbiny M', 'Azmy E', 'Goda T', 'Selim T', 'El-Refaie M', 'Twafik E']","['Mansoura Cancer Institute; Mansoura Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Egypt. salaharef@yahoo.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endostatins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Endostatins/*blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/102453308X315898 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2008 Apr;13(2):95-100. doi: 10.1179/102453308X315898.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, these patients typically experience profound neutropenia following induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy and this may result in serious, potentially life-threatening, infection. This randomized, double-blind, phase 2 clinical trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of pegfilgrastim with filgrastim for assisting neutrophil recovery following induction and consolidation chemotherapy for de novo AML in patients with low-to-intermediate risk cytogenetics. METHODS: Patients (n = 84) received one or two courses of standard induction chemotherapy (idarubicin + cytarabine), followed by one course of consolidation therapy (high-dose cytarabine) if complete remission was achieved. They were randomized to receive either single-dose pegfilgrastim 6 mg or daily filgrastim 5 mug/kg, beginning 24 hours after induction and consolidation chemotherapy. RESULTS: The median time to recovery from severe neutropenia was 22.0 days for both pegfilgrastim (n = 42) and filgrastim (n = 41) groups during Induction 1 (difference 0.0 days; 95% CI: -1.9 to 1.9). During Consolidation, recovery occurred after a median of 17.0 days for pegfilgrastim versus 16.5 days for filgrastim (difference 0.5 days; 95% CI: -1.1 to 2.1). Therapeutic pegfilgrastim serum concentrations were maintained throughout neutropenia. Pegfilgrastim was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of filgrastim. CONCLUSION: These data suggest no clinically meaningful difference between a single dose of pegfilgrastim and multiple daily doses of filgrastim for shortening the duration of severe neutropenia following chemotherapy in de novo AML patients with low-to-intermediate risk cytogenetics.

RESULTS: A phage display library was screened by 5 rounds of biopanning with freshly isolated human AML cells. Individual colonies were randomly picked and after purification, biologic activity (growth and differentiation) on fresh AML cells was profiled. Ten peptides were synthesized for further biological studies. Multiple peptides were found to selectively bind to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. The peptides bound to leukemia cells, were internalized and could induce proliferation and/or differentiation in the target patient cells. Two of the peptides, HP-A2 and HP-G7, appeared to have a novel mechanism of inducing differentiation since they did not cause G1 arrest in cycling cells even as the expression of the differentiation marker CD11b increased. CONCLUSION: Peptide induced differentiation of leukemia cells offers a novel treatment strategy for myeloid malignancies, whereas their ability to induce proliferation could be harnessed to make cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. Conceptually, these leukemia specific peptides can also be used to refine diagnosis, document minimal residual disease, and selectively deliver toxins to malignant cells.","['Galili, Naomi', 'Devemy, Emmanuelle', 'Raza, Azra']","['Galili N', 'Devemy E', 'Raza A']","[""Saint Vincent's Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. ngalili@aptiumoncology.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding']",2008/07/12 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-8 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-8 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jul 10;1:8. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-8.,,,PMC2494998,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It shows a remarkable heterogeneity, with some patients having an almost normal lifespan, others surviving only several years after diagnosis despite intensive therapy. To investigate lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression level in Chinese patients with CLL and its correlation with other prognostic factors, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH) mutation status, Binet stages, ZAP-70 protein and CD38 expression level, semiquantitative RT-PCR was used to detect LPL expression in peripheral blood samples of 58 Chinese patients with CLL. LPL expression level was significantly correlated with IgVH mutational status (r = 0.348, P = 0.010), Binet stages (r = 0.276, P = 0.036), ZAP-70 protein (r = 0.431, P = 0.001) and CD38 (r = 0.546, P < 0.001). Patients with unmutated IgVH genes had higher expression of LPL than patients with IgVH mutations. The higher expression level of LPL was also associated with higher level of ZAP-70 and CD38, and more aggressive Binet stage. We also analyzed LPL expression in different cytogenetic subgroups. Higher LPL level was found in patients with unfavorable cytogenetic aberrations (deletion in 17p13 or 11q22) in contrast to lower level in good risk cytogenetics (deletion in 13q as the sole abnormality) (r = 0.404, P = 0.002). It was showed that LPL expression correlates with IgVH mutational status and other clinical or laboratory prognostic factors, and might be applied for the assessment of prognosis in patients with CLL.","['Xu, W', 'Li, J-Y', 'Shen, Q-D', 'Wu, Y-J', 'Yu, H', 'Fan, L']","['Xu W', 'Li JY', 'Shen QD', 'Wu YJ', 'Yu H', 'Fan L']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing 210029, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20090627,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asians/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*genetics']",2008/07/12 09:00,2009/10/27 06:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/10/27 06:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['CLH1078 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01078.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2009 Oct;31(5):552-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-553X.2008.01078.x.

In this study, we show that RNA interference-mediated repression of the genes encoding the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)-specific proteases, Senp1, Senp2, and Senp7, induced low passage primary human fibroblasts to senesce rapidly. Following Senp1 repression, we observed a global increase in sumoylated proteins and in the number and size of nuclear SUMO-containing promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies. SUMO/PML bodies also increased during replicative senescence. p53 transcriptional activity was enhanced towards known p53 target genes following repression of Senp1, and inhibition of p53 function prevented senescence after Senp1 repression. These data indicate that Senp1 repression induces p53-mediated premature senescence and that SUMO proteases may thus be required for proliferation of normal human cells.","['Yates, Kristin E', 'Korbel, Gregory A', 'Shtutman, Michael', 'Roninson, Igor B', 'DiMaio, Daniel']","['Yates KE', 'Korbel GA', 'Shtutman M', 'Roninson IB', 'DiMaio D']","['Department of Genetics, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8005, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080724,England,Aging Cell,Aging cell,101130839,"['0 (SUMO-1 Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.- (SENP1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (SENP2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aging/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/genetics/*physiology', 'Endopeptidases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Repression/genetics/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'RNA Interference/physiology', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['ACE411 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00411.x [doi]']",ppublish,Aging Cell. 2008 Oct;7(5):609-21. doi: 10.1111/j.1474-9726.2008.00411.x.

Understanding the number of individuals with CLL is vital to assess disease burden within the wider population. METHODS: Using 2002 data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, we estimated the number of individuals with CLL (ICD-10 C91.1) from those reported for all leukaemias (C91-95) and extrapolated the figures by the population increase within the EU between 2002 and 2006, the last year with fully updated community population estimates. One- and 5-yr partial prevalence estimates are reported (i.e. the number of individuals still living 1-5 yr post-diagnosis). We then applied proportional estimates from the literature to assess those requiring immediate treatment, those under observation and their likely progression rates. RESULTS: We found that within the 27 EU states plus Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein, 1- and 5-yr CLL partial prevalence estimates totalled approximately 13,952 and 46,633 individuals respectively in 2006. By applying Binet staging to the 1-yr estimate, 40% of patients will be stage B/C and require immediate treatment. Thus, 5581 individuals may be treated within the first year of diagnosis. Of the 60% (8371) under observation, by 5 yr up to 33% (2763) may have more advanced disease with increased risk of mortality. CONCLUSION: Whilst CLL is a rare disease, the number of individuals burdened by the disease within the EU is considerable and thousands of patients require treatment and physician care, which has cost implications for member states.","['Watson, Louise', 'Wyld, Peter', 'Catovsky, Daniel']","['Watson L', 'Wyld P', 'Catovsky D']","['Louise Watson Consulting Ltd, Buxton, UK. louise@louisewatsonconsulting.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080708,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['European Union', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Prevalence']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1114 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01114.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Oct;81(4):253-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01114.x.

We have previously described a typical growth pattern in CMML patients, i.e., 'pseudonormal' colonies resembling granulocytic colonies but consisting entirely of monocytic cells when stained. To study the utility of the colony forming unit cell assay (CFU-C) as a diagnostic tool in patients with monocytosis, we analyzed a cohort of 48 consecutive patients referred to our institution with peripheral blood monocytosis. Thirty-six patients fulfilled the WHO criteria for CMML; 12 were diagnosed with reactive monocytosis. Of the patients with CMML, 28 showed pseudonormal growth with or without leukemic cluster growth, another four showed exclusively leukemic growth. None of the patients with reactive monocytosis showed either leukemic or pseudonormal growth. With a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 89%, the CFU-C assay has a unique potential to distinguish CMML from reactive monocytosis.","['Birrer, Angelika', 'Jusufi, Florije', 'Bernimoulin, Michael', 'Tichelli, Andre', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Nissen-Druey, Catherine', 'Dirnhofer, Stephan', 'Meyer-Monard, Sandrine', 'Stern, Martin']","['Birrer A', 'Jusufi F', 'Bernimoulin M', 'Tichelli A', 'Gratwohl A', 'Nissen-Druey C', 'Dirnhofer S', 'Meyer-Monard S', 'Stern M']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080708,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1115 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01115.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Oct;81(4):267-72. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01115.x.

As the abnormal activation of JAK2 associated pathway is important to AML, we try to explore the effect of HHT on JAK2-STAT pathway in AML cells, thus supplying theoretical basis for wider use of HHT. METHODS: The cell viability was tested by MTT. Apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry. RT-PCR was used to measure the expression of JAK2, STAT5 and the effect gene Bcl-xL. The signal proteins such as p-JAK2, p-STAT5, p-AKT, p-ERK activated by abnormal activated JAK2 were tested by Western blotting. RESULTS: HHT obviously inhibited the viability of primary AML cells and AML cell lines HEL, K562 and HL-60 cells, AnnexinV-PI double staining confirmed early apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In immunoblotting analysis, when AML cells were affected by HHT for 6 h (much ahead of the time when apoptosis could be induced). The expressions of p-JAK2, p-STAT5, and p-AKT were down-regulated, while the total JAK2, STAT5 and AKT protein levels were stable. There were no changes in p-ERK and BcL-xL proteins. When it prolonged to 24 h, Bcl-xL decreased obviously. Similar results were obtained by using JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490. CONCLUSIONS: HHT possibly acts as a broad-spectrum PTK inhibitor and inhibits the phosphorylation of the signal proteins caused by oncogenic proteins such as JAK2V617F, BCR/ABL, thus blocking the survival and proliferative signal pathway of malignant cells.","['Tong, Hongyan', 'Ren, Yanling', 'Zhang, Fengjuan', 'Jin, Jie']","['Tong H', 'Ren Y', 'Zhang F', 'Jin J']","['Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, China. hongyantong@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080708,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Oncogene Protein v-akt)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Oncogene Protein v-akt/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1116 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01116.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Oct;81(4):259-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01116.x.

Expression of the wildtype protein is essential for the lineage specific differentiation of myelocytic haematopoietic precursors into mature neutrophils. Eight percentage of all AML patients harbour at least one mutation in this gene, increasing up to 15% in the group, where standard karyotypic analysis do not reveal chromosomal aberrations. OBJECTIVE: We designed a method, which discriminates as little as single base insertions or deletions accounting for 90% of all CEBPA mutations. The TAD2C length polymorphism was also identified using this set up. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnostic bone marrow or peripheral blood from 446 adults and 39 children diagnosed with AML from 1980 to 2006 was analysed for mutations by PCR and capillary gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: We analysed pretreatment samples from 485 AML patients and 57 healthy volunteers and identified sequence variations in 35/446 adults and 1/39 children. We were immediately able to distinguish N- and C-terminal insertions and deletions as well as normally occurring polymorphisms. Abnormal PCR products were reprocessed and analysed by direct sequencing. We found stringent accordance between the two methods and reached the same frequency of mutations and polymorphisms as known from the literature. CONCLUSION: We conclude that capillary gel electrophoresis can be used as an accurate and high throughput diagnostic procedure for mutational status in the CEBPA gene identifying not only the same mutational frequency as in the published reports but also the TAD2C polymorphism in addition.","['Juhl-Christensen, Caroline', 'Bomberg, Marianne', 'Melsvik, Dorte', 'Hokland, Peter', 'Nyvold, Charlotte Guldborg']","['Juhl-Christensen C', 'Bomberg M', 'Melsvik D', 'Hokland P', 'Nyvold CG']","['Laboratory of Immunohematology, Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. juhl-christensen@ki.au.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080708,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)']",IM,"['CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Capillary Electrochromatography/methods', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/07/12 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/12 09:00'],"['2008/07/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1117 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01117.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Oct;81(4):273-80. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01117.x.

The present work aimed to study the effects of cell growth and DNA synthesis on the RNA/DNA ratio, which is a promising parameter for cancer diagnosis by inducing synthesis of DNA. Lymphoblastic cell lines were synchronized by methotrexate and harvested for Fourier transform infrared microscopy (FTIR-MSP) at 30-min interval after thymidine addition. The distribution of DNA in the cells/nuclei and variation of nuclear size was studied using the fluorescent dye propidium iodide (PI) and the nuclear volume was calculated from microscopy. We analyzed the ratio of RNA and DNA to quantify the relative amounts during the process by taking the ratios I(1121)/I(1020) (symmetric) and the I(1244)/I(1230) (antisymmetric) phosphate vibrations. The pattern of changes in the ratios overtime obtained in the symmetric and antisymmetric vibrations were similar though the magnitudes were different. Only a minor effect on the RNA/DNA ratio (due to nuclear volume changes) was observed. The effect due to the unfolding of DNA is greatly masked due to RNA absorbance. The effectiveness of this ratio may lie in the increased transcriptional levels in carcinogenic tissues rather than changes occurring due to unfolding and folding of DNA.","['Sahu, Ranjit K', 'Mordechai, Shaul', 'Manor, Ester']","['Sahu RK', 'Mordechai S', 'Manor E']","['Department of Physics and the Cancer Research Center, Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel. ranjit@bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Biopolymers,Biopolymers,0372525,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/*methods']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bip.21048 [doi]'],ppublish,Biopolymers. 2008 Nov;89(11):993-1001. doi: 10.1002/bip.21048.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patterns of KD mutations in Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive acute lympho- blastic leukemia (ALL) are less well studied. METHODS: The authors assessed KD mutations in patients with recurrent Ph-positive ALL after treatments that included 1 or more kinase inhibitors (n = 24 patients) or no prior kinase inhibitor (KI) therapy (n = 12 patients). RESULTS: ABL KD mutations were detected by direct sequencing in 15 of 17 patients (88%) who had recurrent Ph-positive ALL and received prior imatinib (n = 16) or dasatinib (n = 1) treatment and in 6 of 7 patients (86%) who had resistant/recurrent tumors treated with >or=2 KIs compared with 0 of 12 patients with recurrent Ph-positive ALL who never received KIs. A restricted set of mutations was observed, mostly Y253H and T315I, and were detected on average 10 months after KI initiation, and mutations were not detected in the initial tumor samples before KI therapy in 12 patients who were assessed. Using a more sensitive pyrosequencing method, mutations were not detected at codons 315 and 253 in the diagnostic samples from those 12 patients or in 30 patients with Ph-positive ALL who never developed recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: ABL KD mutations, especially at codons 315 and 253, emerged at the time of disease recurrence in the vast majority of patients who had Ph-positive ALL and received maintenance KI therapy. Thus, the authors concluded that ongoing KI exposure may alter the patterns of recurrence and favor the outgrowth of clones with KI-resistant mutations.","['Jones, Dan', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Yin, C Cameron', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Breeden, Megan', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M']","['Jones D', 'Thomas D', 'Yin CC', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes JE', 'Jabbour E', 'Breeden M', 'Giles FJ', 'Zhao W', 'Kantarjian HM']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

We have shown that death of these precursors involved the Fas-dependent activation of caspase-8. To explore the pathway leading from caspase-8 activation to apoptosis, we transduced MDS bone marrow CD34(+) cells with a lentivirus encoding wild-type (WT) or endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-targeted Bcl-2 protein before inducing their erythroid differentiation. Both WT-Bcl-2 and ER-targeted Bcl-2 prevented spontaneous and Fas-dependent apoptosis in MDS erythroid precursors. ER-targeted Bcl-2 inhibited mitochondrial membrane depolarization and cytochrome c release in MDS erythroid precursors undergoing apoptosis, indicating a role for the ER in the death pathway, upstream of the mitochondria. MDS erythroid precursors demonstrated elevated ER Ca(2+) stores and these stores remained unaffected by ER-targeted Bcl-2. The ER-associated protein Bcl-2-associated protein (BAP) 31 was cleaved by caspase-8 in MDS erythroid precursors undergoing apoptosis. The protective effect of ER-targeted Bcl-2 toward spontaneous and Fas-induced apoptosis correlated with inhibition of BAP31 cleavage. A protective effect of erythropoietin against Fas-induced BAP31 cleavage and apoptosis was observed. We propose that apoptosis of MDS erythroid precursors involves the ER, downstream of Fas and upstream of the mitochondria, through the cleavage of the ER-associated BAP31 protein.","['Gyan, E', 'Frisan, E', 'Beyne-Rauzy, O', 'Deschemin, J-C', 'Pierre-Eugene, C', 'Randriamampita, C', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt, A', 'Garrido, C', 'Dreyfus, F', 'Mayeux, P', 'Lacombe, C', 'Solary, E', 'Fontenay, M']","['Gyan E', 'Frisan E', 'Beyne-Rauzy O', 'Deschemin JC', 'Pierre-Eugene C', 'Randriamampita C', 'Dubart-Kupperschmitt A', 'Garrido C', 'Dreyfus F', 'Mayeux P', 'Lacombe C', 'Solary E', 'Fontenay M']","['Department of Hematology, Cochin Institute, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (BCAP31 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Anemia/etiology', '*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/chemistry/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/physiology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/drug therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/analysis/physiology', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008172 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.172 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Oct;22(10):1864-73. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.172.

Using Affymetrix HU133A microarrays, we analyzed the lymphoma transcriptional profile of 30 patients treated with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) and 23 patients treated with rituximab (R)-CHOP in the Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte clinical centers. We used this data set to select transcripts showing an association with progression-free survival in all patients or showing a differential effect in the two treatment groups. We performed real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR in the 23 R-CHOP samples of the screening set and an additional 44 R-CHOP samples set to evaluate the prognostic significance of these transcripts. In these 67 patients, the level of expression of 16 genes and the cell-of-origin classification were significantly associated with overall survival, independently of the International Prognostic Index. A multivariate model comprising four genes of the cell-of-origin signature (LMO2, MME, LPP and FOXP1) and two genes related to immune response, identified for their differential effects in R-CHOP patients (APOBEC3G and RAB33A), demonstrated a high predictive efficiency in this set of patients, suggesting that both features affect outcome in DLBCL patients receiving immunochemotherapy.","['Jais, J-P', 'Haioun, C', 'Molina, T J', 'Rickman, D S', 'de Reynies, A', 'Berger, F', 'Gisselbrecht, C', 'Briere, J', 'Reyes, F', 'Gaulard, P', 'Feugier, P', 'Labouyrie, E', 'Tilly, H', 'Bastard, C', 'Coiffier, B', 'Salles, G', 'Leroy, K']","['Jais JP', 'Haioun C', 'Molina TJ', 'Rickman DS', 'de Reynies A', 'Berger F', 'Gisselbrecht C', 'Briere J', 'Reyes F', 'Gaulard P', 'Feugier P', 'Labouyrie E', 'Tilly H', 'Bastard C', 'Coiffier B', 'Salles G', 'Leroy K']","['Service de Biostatistique, AP-HP, hopital Necker, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (LPP protein, human)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RAB33A protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rab GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytidine Deaminase/genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Metalloproteins/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rituximab', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'rab GTP-Binding Proteins/genetics']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/11/08 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008188 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.188 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Oct;22(10):1917-24. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.188.

Here, we used the quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method to confirm such previous findings, and compared them with those from the cells treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA). The results indicated that the gene expression of the transport factors examined was mostly down-regulated following differentiation induced by DVD and ATRA, but importin alpha5 gene expression was up-regulated in either case. The differences were found in the gene expression of importin alpha3 and exportin 6 between the cells after treatments with DVD and ATRA. These variations may be related to the difference between HL-60 cell lineages differentiating into monocytes/macrophages and granulocytes.

Murine ES cells maintain their pluripotency by the supplementation of the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). LIF is reported to act as a matrix-anchored form, and immobilized cytokines are useful to sustain their signaling on target cells. In this study, we used the immobilizable fusion protein composed of LIF and IgG-Fc region, which was used as a model of the matrix-anchored form of LIF to establish a novel system for ES cell culture and to investigate the effect of immobilized LIF on maintenance of ES cell pluripotency. Mouse ES cells maintained their undifferentiated state on the surface coated with LIF-Fc. Furthermore, when cultured on the co-immobilized surface with LIF-Fc and E-cadherin-Fc, mouse ES cells showed characteristic scattering morphologies without colony formation, and they could maintain their undifferentiated state and pluripotency without additional LIF supplementation. The activation of LIF signaling was sustained on the co-immobilized surface. These results indicate that immobilized LIF and E-cadherin can maintain mouse ES cells efficiently and that the immobilizable LIF-Fc fusion protein is useful for the investigation of signaling pathways of an immobilized form of LIF in the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency.","['Nagaoka, Masato', 'Hagiwara, Yuko', 'Takemura, Keiko', 'Murakami, Yuta', 'Li, Jixuan', 'Duncan, Stephen A', 'Akaike, Toshihiro']","['Nagaoka M', 'Hagiwara Y', 'Takemura K', 'Murakami Y', 'Li J', 'Duncan SA', 'Akaike T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Neurobiology and Anatomy, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin 53226, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cadherins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/chemistry/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/genetics/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)52390-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M805037200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Sep 26;283(39):26468-76. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M805037200.

Disease response after allogeneic transplant is, at least in part, mediated by donor immune cells. In this report we describe a cellular therapy using haploidentical peripheral blood stem cells administered after very low dose total body irradiation (TBI) (100cGy). The donor cells were anticipated to be rejected, so no graft-versus-host (GVHD) prophylaxis was used. Patients with persistent disease beyond 8 weeks could be further treated with infusions of irradiated haploidentical donor cells. Of the 10 patients enrolled in the study, durable engraftment of allogeneic cells was seen in one patient. Two patients with resistant relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) had a disease response. Analysis of T cell reactivity from one patient who achieved a complete response but did not have durable engraftment of donor cells indicated that disease response was associated with the generation of host-derived anti-leukemic cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that reacted with an AML-associated proteinase 3 epitope. Results from this patient suggest that allogeneic therapy induced a host anti-tumor response associated with cytotoxic T cells reactive with a low affinity self-antigen.","['Medina, Daniel J', 'Gharibo, Mecide', 'Savage, Philip', 'Cohler, Alan', 'Kuriyan, Mercy', 'Balsara, Binaifer', 'Anand, Monika', 'Schaar, Dale', 'Krimmel, Tracy', 'Saggiomo, Kara', 'Manago, Jacqueline', 'Talty, Lois', 'Dudek, Liesel', 'Grospe, Stephanie', 'Rubin, Arnold', 'Strair, Roger K']","['Medina DJ', 'Gharibo M', 'Savage P', 'Cohler A', 'Kuriyan M', 'Balsara B', 'Anand M', 'Schaar D', 'Krimmel T', 'Saggiomo K', 'Manago J', 'Talty L', 'Dudek L', 'Grospe S', 'Rubin A', 'Strair RK']","['The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Department of Medicine, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Antigens, CD34/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/blood', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/surgery', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Tissue Donors', 'Tissue Expansion/methods', 'Tissue and Organ Harvesting/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/07/11 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00251-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Dec;32(12):1842-8. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.015.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied the FCIP results and tissue histopathology from 252 patients with B-cell lymphoma seen at Mayo Clinic's site in Rochester, MN, between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004, who had positive results on PB, bone marrow, or body fluid FCIP and a corresponding diagnostic tissue biopsy specimen. RESULTS: Most of the B-cell lymphomas studied were low grade, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma being most common. Flow cytometric immunophenotyping histogram analysis was more informative than tabulated percentage antigen positivity; surface immunoglobulin and CD20 staining intensity, CD5 and CD23 positivity, CD10 positivity, and the coexpression of CD11c/CD22 and CD103 were the most pertinent markers. Using these FCIP parameters and strict immunophenotypic definitions for CLL, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), and hairy cell leukemia, we obtained greater than 95% specificity for each diagnosis. However, we encountered the following exceptions to standard paradigms of B-cell lymphoma-associated FCIP: (1) CD5 expression by disorders distinct from CLL and MCL, (2) lack of uniform CD5 positivity in some CLL and MCL cases, (3) absence of CD10 in approximately 50% of follicular lymphomas, and (4) expression of CD103 by occasional marginal zone lymphomas. CONCLUSION: Stringent interpretation of PB and bone marrow FCIP results enables identification of certain B-cell lymphoma types. However, the observed exceptions to accepted immunophenotypic paradigms highlight the occasional phenotypic overlap among diseases and emphasize that a systematic approach to FCIP interpretations is key to providing clinically useful diagnostic information.","['Morice, William G', 'Kurtin, Paul J', 'Hodnefield, Janice M', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Hoyer, James D', 'Remstein, Ellen D', 'Hanson, Curtis A']","['Morice WG', 'Kurtin PJ', 'Hodnefield JM', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Hoyer JD', 'Remstein ED', 'Hanson CA']","['Division of Hematopathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. morice.william@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Mayo Clin Proc,Mayo Clinic proceedings,0405543,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Blood Cell Count/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*classification/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0025-6196(11)60916-6 [pii]', '10.4065/83.7.776 [doi]']",ppublish,Mayo Clin Proc. 2008 Jul;83(7):776-85. doi: 10.4065/83.7.776.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report on a CML patient in blast crisis presenting with a four-way variant t(9;22) rearrangement involving the EVI1 locus. METHODS: Dual-colour Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation was performed to unravel the different cytogenetic aberrations. Expression levels of EVI1 and BCR/ABL1 were investigated using real-time quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: In this paper we identified a patient with a complex 4-way t(3;9;17;22) which, in addition to BCR/ABL1 gene fusion, also resulted in EVI1 rearrangement and overexpression. CONCLUSION: This report illustrates how a variant t(9;22) translocation can specifically target a second oncogene most likely contributing to the more aggressive phenotype of the disease. Molecular analysis of such variants is thus warranted to understand the phenotypic consequences and to open the way for combined molecular therapies in order to tackle the secondary oncogenic effect which is unresponsive to imatinib treatment.","['De Weer, An', 'Poppe, Bruce', 'Cauwelier, Barbara', 'Carlier, Andre', 'Dierick, Jan', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan', 'Van Roy, Nadine', 'Speleman, Frank']","['De Weer A', 'Poppe B', 'Cauwelier B', 'Carlier A', 'Dierick J', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J', 'Van Roy N', 'Speleman F']","['Centre for Medical Genetics Gent (CMGG), Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium. an.deweer@ugent.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2008/07/11 09:00,2009/06/20 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2407-8-193 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-193 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2008 Jul 9;8:193. doi: 10.1186/1471-2407-8-193.,,,PMC2474635,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although TRIM5 alpha is constitutively expressed, its expression has been shown to be up-regulated by type I interferon (IFN). Among primates, a particular case exists in owl monkey cells, which express a fusion protein between TRIM5 and cyclophilin A, TRIMCyp, specifically interfering with HIV-1 infection. No studies have been conducted so far concerning the possible induction of TRIMCyp by IFN. We investigated the consequences of IFN treatment on retroviral restriction in diverse primate cells and evaluated the implication of TRIM5 alpha or TRIMCyp in IFN-induced anti-retroviral activities. RESULTS: First, we show that human type I IFN can enhance TRIM5 alpha expression in human, African green monkey and macaque cells, as well as TRIMCyp expression in owl monkey cells. In TRIM5 alpha-expressing primate cell lines, type I IFN has little or no effect on HIV-1 infection, whereas it potentiates restriction activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells. In contrast, type I IFN treatment of owl monkey cells induces a great enhancement of HIV-1 restriction, as well as a strain-tropism independent restriction of MLV. We were able to demonstrate that TRIM5 alpha is the main mediator of the IFN-induced activity against N-MLV in human and African green monkey cells, whereas TRIMCyp mediates the IFN-induced HIV-1 restriction enhancement in owl monkey cells. In contrast, the type I IFN-induced anti-MLV restriction in owl monkey cells is independent of TRIMCyp expression. CONCLUSION: Together, our observations indicate that both TRIM5 alpha and TRIMCyp are implicated in IFN-induced anti-retroviral response in primate cells. Furthermore, we found that type I IFN also induces a TRIMCyp-independent restriction activity specific to MLV in owl monkey cells.","['Carthagena, Laetitia', 'Parise, Melanie C', 'Ringeard, Mathieu', 'Chelbi-Alix, Mounira K', 'Hazan, Uriel', 'Nisole, Sebastien']","['Carthagena L', 'Parise MC', 'Ringeard M', 'Chelbi-Alix MK', 'Hazan U', 'Nisole S']","['Institut Cochin, Universite Paris Descartes, CNRS (UMR 8104), Departement des Maladies Infectieuses, 22 rue Mechain, 75014, Paris, France. laetitia.carthagena@inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Restriction Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (TRIM5(alpha) protein, rhesus monkey)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 5.2.1.- (Cyclophilin A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Restriction Factors', 'Aotus trivirgatus', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cyclophilin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HIV-1/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferons/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/pathogenicity', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases', 'Vero Cells']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-59 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-59 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Jul 9;5:59. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-59.,,,PMC2483995,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concomitant intravenous (IV) iron supplementation has the potential to improve response to erythropoietin, allowing a decrease in erythropoietin dose requirements. In a recent study of anaemic, iron-replete patients with lymphoproliferative malignancies (Leukemia, 21, 2007, 627), the haemoglobin (Hb) increase and response rate were significantly greater in patients receiving epoetin beta with concomitant IV iron compared with patients receiving epoetin beta without IV iron (P < 0.05). The present analysis aimed to investigate whether a combination of epoetin beta and IV iron is cost-effective compared with epoetin beta without IV iron. METHODS: This analysis was performed from a Swedish societal perspective as a within-trial evaluation of overall costs (based on differences in drug costs and resource use between groups) and effect (differences in Hb increases) during 16 weeks' treatment with epoetin beta with or without concomitant IV iron. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: There was an improved response to epoetin beta with IV iron therapy and an almost 2-fold greater increase in Hb levels. Overall mean cost per patient in the epoetin beta with IV iron group was euro5558 and in the epoetin beta without IV iron group was euro6228. Thus, treatment with epoetin beta with IV iron resulted in overall cost savings of about 11% compared with epoetin beta without iron, mainly due to reduced erythropoietin dosages.

In this review, we describe the incidence, predictive factors, clinical course, outcome and treatment of RAS in patients with APL treated with ATRA. The incidence of RAS in patients receiving ATRA is about 14-16%, with an associated mortality of about 2%. Initial high white blood cell (WBC) count, rapidly increasing WBC count and/or the presence of the CD 13 expression on leukaemic cells may help in identifying patients likely to develop RAS. Concurrent chemotherapy will probably decrease the risk of developing RAS but often exacerbates bleeding, leading to leucocytosis, thrombocytopenia, disseminated intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis. Prophylactic steroids are not recommended but prompt administration of steroids at the first sign of unexplained dyspnea, fever, weight gain or pulmonary infiltrate, is critical. Liposomal ATRA is being investigated to induce haematological cure in APL without chemotherapy and to reduce the incidence of RAS but further validation of its usefulness is necessary.","['Patatanian, E', 'Thompson, D F']","['Patatanian E', 'Thompson DF']","['Department of Pharmacy Practice, College of Pharmacy, Southwestern Oklahoma State University, Weatherford, OK 73103, USA. edna.patatanian@swosu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'CD13 Antigens', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucocorticoids/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2008/07/11 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCP935 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2710.2008.00935.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2008 Aug;33(4):331-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2710.2008.00935.x.,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Type I and II cytokine receptors associate with Janus family kinases (JAKs) to effect intracellular signaling. These structurally unique protein kinases play essential and specific roles in immune cell development and function. One JAK, JAK3, has particularly selective functions. Mutations of this kinase underlie severe combined immunodeficiency, indicative of its critical role in the development and function of lymphocytes. Because JAK3 appears not to have functions outside of hematopoietic cells, this kinase has been viewed as an excellent therapeutic target for the development of a new class of immunosuppressive drugs. In fact, several companies are developing JAK3 inhibitors, and Phase II studies are underway. Mutations of Tyk2 cause autosomal recessive hyperIgE syndrome, and in principle, Tyk2 inhibitors might also be useful as immunosuppressive drugs. JAK2 gain-of-function mutations (V617F) underlie a subset of disorders collectively referred to as myeloproliferative diseases and phase 2 trials using JAK inhibitors are underway in this setting. Thus, we are learning a great deal about the feasibility and effectiveness of targeting Janus kinases, and it appears likely that this will be a fruitful strategy in a variety of settings.","['Pesu, Marko', 'Laurence, Arian', 'Kishore, Nandini', 'Zwillich, Samuel H', 'Chan, Gary', ""O'Shea, John J""]","['Pesu M', 'Laurence A', 'Kishore N', 'Zwillich SH', 'Chan G', ""O'Shea JJ""]","['Molecular Immunology and Inflammation Branch, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (TYK2 Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Graft Rejection/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/genetics/*immunology', 'Job Syndrome/drug therapy/enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'TYK2 Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*immunology', 'src Homology Domains/drug effects']",2008/07/11 09:00,2009/06/18 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/06/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMR644 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00644.x [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2008 Jun;223:132-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00644.x.,103,['Z99 AR999999/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2634846,['NIHMS81998'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, HSP70 of both autologous and allogeneic origin was found to stimulate IFN-gamma production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients, as well as of normal subjects. Further investigations demonstrated that the activity of HSP70 was dependent on both NK cells and dendritic cells (DCs). HSP70 did not induce significant IFN-gamma production from either NK cells or DCs alone. Mechanistically, we found that HSP70-mediated DC-NK cell crosstalk required cell-cell contact, which could be inhibited completely by neutralizing antibody against NK activating receptor NKG2D. The significance of NKG2D was further corroborated by the finding that HSP70 induced the expression of an NKG2D ligand, the MHC class I chain-related protein A (MICA), on DCs; HSP70-augmented IFN-gamma release was abrogated by antibody against MICA. Thus extracellular HSP70, released during either stress or inflammatory cell death, may serve as a critical link between NK and DCs in mounting immune responses against infections, cancers and self-antigens.","['Qiao, Yi', 'Liu, Bei', 'Li, Zihai']","['Qiao Y', 'Liu B', 'Li Z']","['Center for Immunotherapy of Cancer and Infectious Diseases, Department of Immunology, University of Connecticut School of Medicine, Farmington, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080710,United States,Cancer Immun,Cancer immunity,101119871,"['0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MHC class I-related chain A)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cancer Vaccines', 'Cell Communication', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/blood/*immunology/pharmacology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology']",2008/07/11 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/07/11 09:00'],"['2008/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [entrez]']",['080512 [pii]'],epublish,Cancer Immun. 2008 Jul 10;8:12.,,,PMC2935777,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This complication can have grave effects if not successfully treated, with a 10-20% incidence of haemorrhagic death. We hypothesized that alpha-2-antiplasmin levels would correlate with the risk for bleeding, and that administration of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA) would attenuate that risk. To assess this, we conducted a retrospective chart review analyzing 30 APML patients, 17 of whom were treated with EACA. Thirty patients were treated, 21 with primary induction therapy. Patients with low alpha-2-antiplasmin levels were treated with a coagulopathy protocol consisting of low-dose heparin, EACA and blood product support. Seventeen patients (57%) developed haemorrhagic complications during their treatment. The presence and grade of haemorrhage appeared to be associated with the alpha-2-antiplasmin level. There were no grade IV haemorrhages or episodes of haemorrhagic death. One episode of central venous catheter associated thromboembolism and three deaths from infection during chemotherapy were observed. alpha-2-Antiplasmin levels are a reliable surrogate for fibrinolysis and haemorrhagic risk in patients with APML. Treatment with EACA is a rational way to pharmacologically inhibit fibrinolysis, is associated with a low incidence of severe haemorrhagic events, and appears to be safe with a low risk of thrombosis. Randomized clinical trials further assessing the efficacy and potential toxicity of EACA in inhibiting fibrinolysis in patients with APML are needed.","['Wassenaar, T', 'Black, J', 'Kahl, B', 'Schwartz, B', 'Longo, W', 'Mosher, D', 'Williams, E']","['Wassenaar T', 'Black J', 'Kahl B', 'Schwartz B', 'Longo W', 'Mosher D', 'Williams E']","['University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53792, USA. tr.wassenaar@hosp.wisc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Antifibrinolytic Agents)', '0 (alpha-2-Antiplasmin)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)', 'U6F3787206 (Aminocaproic Acid)']",IM,"['Aminocaproic Acid/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antifibrinolytic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced', 'Heparin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'alpha-2-Antiplasmin/*deficiency']",2008/07/10 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.867 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2008 Dec;26(4):241-6. doi: 10.1002/hon.867.,,['P30 CA014520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3496178,['NIHMS398867'],,,"['Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to identify early gene expression patterns that may be important in establishing this strain-specific differential response. Total RNA was isolated from spleens and pooled lymph nodes of both mouse strains at 3 and 7 days post virus infection. The complementary DNA generated from this RNA was hybridized to mouse oligonucleotide DNA microarrays using a strategy that controlled for inherent variability and highlighted only virus-induced changes. Fluorescent intensities were normalized and analyzed for statistically significant differential expression between strains across both time points and lymphoid organs. The majority of the resistance-associated genes was identified at day 3 post-infection and demonstrated the highest fold differences between strains, while more susceptibility-associated sequences were seen at 7 days post-infection. Among the most highly differentially expressed sequences seen at the earlier time point were genes related to protein metabolism, especially serine proteases. Differential patterns of chemokine-related genes were observed at the later time point.

However, its expression in hematologic malignancies including CML has not been described yet. Here, we report the expression of AQP5 in CML cells by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. While normal bone marrow biopsy samples (n = 5) showed no expression of AQP5, 32% of CML patient samples (n = 41) demonstrated AQP5 expression. In addition, AQP5 expression level increased with the emergence of imatinib mesylate resistance in paired samples (p = 0.047). We have found that the overexpression of AQP5 in K562 cells resulted in increased cell proliferation. In addition, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting AQP5 reduced the cell proliferation rate in both K562 and LAMA84 CML cells. Moreover, by immunoblotting and flow cytometry, we show that phosphorylation of BCR-ABL1 is increased in AQP5-overexpressing CML cells and decreased in AQP5 siRNA-treated CML cells. Interestingly, caspase9 activity increased in AQP5 siRNA-treated cells. Finally, FISH showed no evidence of AQP5 gene amplification in CML from bone marrow. In summary, we report for the first time that AQP5 is overexpressed in CML cells and plays a role in promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings may provide the basis for a novel CML therapy targeting AQP5.","['Chae, Young Kwang', 'Kang, Sung Koo', 'Kim, Myoung Sook', 'Woo, Janghee', 'Lee, Juna', 'Chang, Steven', 'Kim, Dong-Wook', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Kim, Inho', 'Keam, Bhumsuk', 'Rhee, Jiyoung', 'Koo, Nam Hee', 'Park, Gyeongsin', 'Kim, Soo-Hyun', 'Jang, Se-Eun', 'Kweon, Il-Young', 'Sidransky, David', 'Moon, Chulso']","['Chae YK', 'Kang SK', 'Kim MS', 'Woo J', 'Lee J', 'Chang S', 'Kim DW', 'Kim M', 'Park S', 'Kim I', 'Keam B', 'Rhee J', 'Koo NH', 'Park G', 'Kim SH', 'Jang SE', 'Kweon IY', 'Sidransky D', 'Moon C']","['Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, School of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AQP5 protein, human)', '0 (Aquaporin 5)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Aquaporin 5/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2008/07/10 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002594 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jul 9;3(7):e2594. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002594.,,"['P50 CA096784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA96784-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2440422,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among them, 22 were given a reduced-intensity allogeneic SCT, whereas 50 were given a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), mainly imatinib mesylate. The 6-year overall survival (OS) after the therapeutic intervention for patients allografted or given a TKI was 77 and 84%, respectively (P, NS); the median OS for both groups has not been reached, being above 90 and 71 months, respectively (P, NS). The freedom from progression to blast or accelerated phases was also similar for both groups, as well as the overall OS after diagnosis. Most patients allografted (91%) chose this treatment because they were unable to afford continuing treatment with the TKI, whereas most treated with the TKI (84%) were given the treatment without charge, through institutions able to pay for their treatment. The median cost of each nonmyeloablative allograft was US$18,000, an amount that is enough to cover 180 days of treatment with imatinib (400 mg per day) in Mexico.

METHODS: A cohort of 170,481 postmenopausal Korean women who were age 40 to 64 years at baseline measurement of BMI was observed prospectively from 1994 to 2003 for cancer incidence. Multivariable adjusted proportional hazard models were used for evaluating the association. RESULTS: Women with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or higher had a 23% higher risk of cancer than women with a BMI between 21.0 and 22.9 kg/m(2) (hazard ratio = 1.23; 95% CI, 1.08 to 1.41). According to the increase in BMI level, significant positive trends existed in cancers of colon, breast, corpus uteri, and kidney with hazard ratios of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.08), 1.07 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.10), 1.13 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.20), and 1.08 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.15), respectively, for the increase of BMI by 1 kg/m(2). When the analysis was limited to never-smokers, women with a BMI of 25 kg/m(2) or higher showed a significantly increased risk of cancers of the colon, breast, corpus uteri, and kidney and leukemia compared with the normal BMI (18.5 to 22.9 kg/m(2)) group. CONCLUSION: Although variations exist between the individual cancer sites, obesity was associated with an overall increased risk of cancer in postmenopausal Korean women. To reduce the risk of cancer, active strategies to prevent obesity should be implemented in postmenopausal women.","['Song, Yun-Mi', 'Sung, Joohon', 'Ha, Mina']","['Song YM', 'Sung J', 'Ha M']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Dankook University College of Medicine, Cheonan, Chungnam, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Body Mass Index', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Korea/epidemiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Obesity/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', '*Postmenopause', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/07/10 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/20/3395 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.7867 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jul 10;26(20):3395-402. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.7867.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anecdotal reports suggest that these adjustments may have negatively affected access to chemotherapy for Medicare beneficiaries. OBJECTIVE: To compare patient wait times and travel distances for chemotherapy before and after the enactment of the MMA. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Analysis of a nationally representative 5% sample of claims from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services for the period 2003 through 2006. Patients were Medicare beneficiaries with incident breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, or lymphoma who received chemotherapy in inpatient hospital, institutional outpatient, or physician office settings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Days from incident diagnosis to first chemotherapy visit and distance traveled for treatment, controlling for age, sex, race/ethnicity, cancer type, geographic region, comorbid conditions, and year of diagnosis and treatment. RESULTS: There were 5082 incident cases of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, or lymphoma in 2003; 5379 cases in 2004; 5116 cases in 2005; and 5288 cases in 2006. Approximately 70% of patients received treatment in physician office settings in each year. Although the distribution of treatment settings in 2004 and 2005 was not significantly different from 2003 (P = .24 and P = .72, respectively), there was a small but significant change from 2003 to 2006 (P = .02). The proportion of patients receiving chemotherapy in inpatient settings decreased from 10.2% in 2003 to 8.8% in 2006 (P = .03), and the proportion in institutional outpatient settings increased from 21.1% to 22.5% (P = .004). The proportion in physician offices remained at 68.7% (P = .29). The median time from diagnosis to initial chemotherapy visit was 28 days in 2003, 27 days in 2004, 29 days in 2005, and 28 days in 2006. In multivariate analyses, average wait times for chemotherapy were 1.96 days longer in 2005 than in 2003 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-3.80 days; P = .04) but not significantly different in 2006 (0.88 days; 95% CI, -0.96 to 2.71 days; P = .35). Median travel distance was 7 miles (11.2 km) in 2003 and 8 miles (12.8 km) in 2004 through 2006. After adjustment, average travel distance remained slightly longer in 2004 (1.47 miles [2.35 km]; 95% CI, 0.87-2.07 miles [1.39-3.31 km]; P < .001), 2005 (1.19 miles [1.90 km]; 95% CI, 0.58-1.80 miles [0.93-2.88 km]; P < .001), and 2006 (1.30 miles [2.08 km]; 95% CI, 0.69-1.90 miles [1.10-3.04 km]; P < .001) compared with 2003. CONCLUSION: There have not been major changes in travel distance and patient wait times for chemotherapy in the Medicare population since 2003, the year before MMA-related changes in reimbursement.","['Shea, Alisa M', 'Curtis, Lesley H', 'Hammill, Bradley G', 'DiMartino, Lisa D', 'Abernethy, Amy P', 'Schulman, Kevin A']","['Shea AM', 'Curtis LH', 'Hammill BG', 'DiMartino LD', 'Abernethy AP', 'Schulman KA']","['Center for Clinical and Genetic Economics, Duke Clinical Research Institute, PO Box 17969, Durham, NC 27715, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,JAMA,JAMA,7501160,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Ambulatory Care/statistics & numerical data', '*Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/economics', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', '*Health Services Accessibility', 'Humans', 'Inpatients/statistics & numerical data', 'Linear Models', 'Male', '*Medicare Part D/legislation & jurisprudence', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/economics', 'Office Visits/statistics & numerical data', 'Reimbursement Mechanisms', 'Research Design', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data', '*Waiting Lists']",2008/07/10 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['300/2/189 [pii]', '10.1001/jama.300.2.189 [doi]']",ppublish,JAMA. 2008 Jul 9;300(2):189-96. doi: 10.1001/jama.300.2.189.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was open to patients with an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with an MKI67 fraction approaching 100%. Immunophenotype and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) were used to separate BL from other aggressive B-cell lymphomas. BL was characterized by the presence of a cMYC rearrangement as a sole cytogenetic abnormality occurring in patients with a germinal center phenotype with absence of BCL-2 expression and abnormal TP53 expression. A total of 128 patients were eligible for the study, of whom 58 were considered to have BL and 70 to have diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). There were 110 clinically fit patients who received dmCODOX-M (methotrexate, dose 3 g/m(2)) with or without IVAC according to risk group. The 2-year progression-free survival was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51%-77%) for BL, 55% (95% CI 42%-66%) for DLBCL, 85% (95% CI 73%-97%) for low risk, and 49% (95% CI 38%-60%) for high-risk patients. The observed differences in outcome and other clinical features validate the proposed diagnostic criteria.

We present a patient with similar clinical findings, in addition to absence of the thumbs, hypoplasia of the radii and ulnae, additional vertebrae and ribs, retarded bone age and genital hypoplasia. METHODS: Genomic DNA from the patient was screened for chromosomal imbalances by array-based comparative genomic hybridisation. DNA sequence analyses and reporter gene assays were performed in order to identify candidate gene mutations. RESULTS: The patient has an approximately 8 Mbp de novo deletion on the paternal chromosome 11, which includes the promyelocytic leukaemia zinc-finger gene (PLZF, ZBTB16; OMIM 176797). The maternal PLZF allele harbours a recessive missense mutation (c.1849A-->G), which leads to the substitution of a highly conserved methionine by valine (p.Met617Val) within a zinc-finger motif. Taking into account specific alpha-helical propensities of Val and Met, this mutation is likely to destabilise the alpha helix of the zinc finger that forms the contact with the DNA duplex, thus affecting the biological function as shown by reporter-gene assays. DISCUSSION: The PLZF gene is one of five partners fused to the retinoic acid receptor alpha in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. We describe the first patient, to our knowledge, with a germline mutation of PLZF. Our findings as well as observations in Plzf-deficient mice indicate that PLZF is a key regulator of skeletal and male germline development. Furthermore, this case highlights the importance of searching for a recessive mutation on the non-deleted chromosome in patients with a microdeletion and atypical clinical findings.","['Fischer, S', 'Kohlhase, J', 'Bohm, D', 'Schweiger, B', 'Hoffmann, D', 'Heitmann, M', 'Horsthemke, B', 'Wieczorek, D']","['Fischer S', 'Kohlhase J', 'Bohm D', 'Schweiger B', 'Hoffmann D', 'Heitmann M', 'Horsthemke B', 'Wieczorek D']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Letter', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080708,England,J Med Genet,Journal of medical genetics,2985087R,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Diseases/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Comparative Genomic Hybridization', 'Face/pathology', 'Genital Diseases, Male/*genetics', 'Growth Disorders/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Microcephaly/genetics', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein']",2008/07/10 09:00,2009/01/01 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']","['jmg.2008.059451 [pii]', '10.1136/jmg.2008.059451 [doi]']",ppublish,J Med Genet. 2008 Nov;45(11):731-7. doi: 10.1136/jmg.2008.059451.

The main schedules adopted for clinical applications of GM-CSF in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) were post-chemotherapy, in order to shorten the duration of neutropenia, and as a mobilising agent to induce release of progenitor cells from bone marrow into circulation. METHODS: Based on the variety of biologic effects being attributed to GM-CSF, additional clinical uses for GM-CSF have been under investigation. Concurrent administration to chemotherapy has been used to recruit blast cells into active cell cycle phases, and to increase their sensitivity to cell cycle-dependent cytotoxic drugs. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: Exposure to GM-CSF also has recently been shown to enhance cellular immunity and indirectly stimulate anti-tumour immunity. On the other hand, GM-CSF can directly enhance immunogenicity of tumours.","['Thomas, Xavier']",['Thomas X'],"['Edouard Herriot Hospital, Department of Haematology, Hospices Civils de Lyon, 69437, Lyon cedex 03, France. xavier.thomas@chu-lyon.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'B321AL142J (molgramostim)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/10 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/17425255.4.6.795 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2008 Jun;4(6):795-806. doi: 10.1517/17425255.4.6.795.,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the ability of SFN to induce cytodifferentiation and apoptosis in a leukemia cell line was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were treated with different concentrations of SFN (0-100 microM). Analysis of cell differentiation was performed by nonspecific/specific acid esterase activity. Apoptosis induction was performed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: SFN induced cytodifferentiation toward both granulocytic and macrophagic lineage, mediated by the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase C. It also caused a significant increase in the apoptotic cell fraction. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that SFN may be a promising antileukemic agent and should encourage further investigation as regards its chemotherapeutic potential.","['Fimognari, Carmela', 'Lenzi, Monia', 'Cantelli-Forti, Giorgio', 'Hrelia, Patrizia']","['Fimognari C', 'Lenzi M', 'Cantelli-Forti G', 'Hrelia P']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Italy. carmela.fimognari@unibo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,In Vivo,"In vivo (Athens, Greece)",8806809,"['0 (Isothiocyanates)', '0 (Sulfoxides)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '3129-90-6 (isothiocyanic acid)', 'GA49J4310U (sulforaphane)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/*cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isothiocyanates/*pharmacology', 'Sulfoxides', 'Thiocyanates/*pharmacology']",2008/07/10 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/07/10 09:00'],"['2008/07/10 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/10 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,In Vivo. 2008 May-Jun;22(3):317-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 mRNA and protein expression were analyzed in CRC cell lines as well as human CRC tissue by Western blot, quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 protein expression was knocked down or increased in CRC cell lines by applying specific siRNAs or expression plasmids, respectively. After modulation of protein expression, CRC cells were treated with chemotherapeutic agents, an antagonistic epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR1) antibody, an EGFR1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or with the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Apoptosis induction and cell viability were analyzed. RESULTS: Here we show that in human CRC tissue and various CRC cell lines both Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 are expressed. Bcl-x(L) expression was higher in CRC tissue than in surrounding non-malignant tissue, both on protein and mRNA level. Mcl-1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in malignant tissues. However, protein expression was slightly higher. Viability rates of CRC cells were significantly decreased after knock down of Bcl-x(L) expression, and, to a lower extent, after knock down of Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, cells with reduced Bcl-x(L) or Mcl-1 expression was more sensitive towards oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-induced apoptosis, and in the case of Bcl-x(L) also towards 5-FU-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, upregulation of Bcl-x(L) by transfection of an expression plasmid decreased chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis. EGF treatment clearly induced Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 expression in CRC cells. Apoptosis induction upon EGFR1 blockage by cetuximab or PD168393 was increased by inhibiting Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L) expression. More strikingly, CD95- and TRAIL-induced apoptosis was increased by Bcl-x(L) knock down. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Bcl-x(L) and, to a lower extent, Mcl-1, are important anti-apoptotic factors in CRC.

METHODS: The role of p53 and PML in regulating cytotoxicity and gene transfer mediated by wild-type (wt) PV H-1 were explored in two pairs of isogenic human hepatoma cell lines with different p53 status. Furthermore, H-1 PV infection was combined with cytostatic drug treatment. RESULTS: While the HCC cells with different p53 status studied were all susceptible to H-1 PV-induced apoptosis, the cytotoxicity of H-1 PV was more pronounced in p53-negative than in p53-positive cells. Apoptosis rates in p53-negative cell lines treated by genotoxic drugs were further enhanced by a treatment with H-1 PV. In flow cytometric analyses, H-1 PV infection resulted in a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. In addition, H-1 PV cells showed a significant increase in PML expression. Knocking down PML expression resulted in a striking reduction of the level of H-1 PV infected tumor cell death. CONCLUSION: H-1 PV is a suitable agent to circumvent the resistance of p53-negative HCC cells to genotoxic agents, and it enhances the apoptotic process which is dependent on functional PML. Thus, H-1 PV and its oncolytic vector derivatives may be considered as therapeutic options for HCC, particularly for p53-negative tumors.","['Sieben, Maike', 'Herzer, Kerstin', 'Zeidler, Maja', 'Heinrichs, Vera', 'Leuchs, Barbara', 'Schuler, Martin', 'Cornelis, Jan-J', 'Galle, Peter-R', 'Rommelaere, Jean', 'Moehler, Markus']","['Sieben M', 'Herzer K', 'Zeidler M', 'Heinrichs V', 'Leuchs B', 'Schuler M', 'Cornelis JJ', 'Galle PR', 'Rommelaere J', 'Moehler M']","['First Department of Internal Medicine of Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,World J Gastroenterol,World journal of gastroenterology,100883448,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'H-1 parvovirus/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/*virology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3748/wjg.14.3819 [doi]'],ppublish,World J Gastroenterol. 2008 Jun 28;14(24):3819-28. doi: 10.3748/wjg.14.3819.,,,PMC2721438,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All cause, all cancer and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios were calculated. Cox regression analyses were conducted to further evaluate the relation between chemical exposure and mortality risk due to selected cancers. RESULTS: The mortality due to all causes combined and all cancers combined were below expectation for the cohort. There were no statistically significant elevations reported among males for any specific cancer or non-cancer outcome. There no statistically significant elevations among females for any specific non-cancer and most specific cancers; however, multiple myeloma deaths were significantly elevated (SMR = 3.56; 95% CI = 1.43-7.33; number of observed deaths, n = 7). Statistically significant elevations were seen among workers employed 20+ years for leukemia using both 2- and 5-year lag periods. Also, a statistically significant positive trend of elevated lung cancer mortality with increasing employment duration was seen using both 5- and 10-year lags. A similar trend was seen for smoking related cancers among men. CONCLUSION: While lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer mortality was below expectation, a significant elevation of multiple myeloma deaths among females and an elevation of leukemia among workers employed 20+ years (possibly due to radiation and benzene exposure) were observed.

METHODS: The authors evaluated 180 patients with acute childhood leukemia. Lesions associated with leukemia may be classified as specific (due to leukemic infiltration of various ocular tissues), nonspecific (due to one of the secondary complications), or iatrogenic manifestations caused by chemotherapy. Risk-based treatment assignment is based on clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis. Children with presenting white blood cell count below 50,000 mm3 are considered at standard risk for treatment failure, while all others are considered at high risk for treatment failure. RESULTS: Specific lesions were noted in 66% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 11.5% patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (p<0.05), and were more severe in patients with high risk leukemia than in patients with standard risk leukemia. Orbital or ocular lesions were noted more commonly in patients with AML (66.6%) compared to patients with ALL (15.1%). In both the AML and ALL groups, there was a higher frequency of leukemic relapses in the bone marrow and/or central nervous system in patients with specific lesions (63.1%) compared to patients with nonspecific lesions (42%), and in patients without orbital or ocular lesions (29.2%) (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In both the AML and ALL groups, the presence of specific orbital or ocular lesions was associated with a higher frequency of bone marrow relapses and CNS involvement (p<0.05), leading to a lower survival rate.","['Russo, V', 'Scott, I U', 'Querques, G', 'Stella, A', 'Barone, A', 'Delle Noci, N']","['Russo V', 'Scott IU', 'Querques G', 'Stella A', 'Barone A', 'Delle Noci N']","['Institute of Ophthalmology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. virus66@inwind.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Eur J Ophthalmol,European journal of ophthalmology,9110772,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/*pathology', 'Male', 'Orbital Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*pathology', 'Survival Rate']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/09/03 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/112067210801800420 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Ophthalmol. 2008 Jul-Aug;18(4):619-23. doi: 10.1177/112067210801800420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The VEGF and HGF plasma levels were analysed by ELISA in 38 newly diagnosed CML patients. Immunohistochemical methods were used to visualize the MVD as well as the cellular VEGF/KDR and HGF/MET expression. RESULTS: We found an increased MVD, cellular VEGF/KDR and HGF/MET expression and elevated plasma VEGF and HGF in CML patients. The plasma HGF, cellular HGF and MET expression correlated with the CML phase. The plasma HGF correlated with all markers reflecting the tumour burden (leucocytes, blast percentage, splenomegaly and LDH) as well as with the phase of CML and overall survival of the patients. Cox regression analysis determined the prognostic relevance of HGF and MVD parameters, but not for the plasma VEGF and cellular VEGF and KDR. CONCLUSIONS: Using a complex angiogenic assessment we determined an increased angiogenesis in CML patients. No prognostic relevance was found for VEGF plasma levels or VEGF/KDR cellular bone marrow expression. The increased cellular HGF and MET expressions could be considered high-risk factors for these patients. Plasma HGF and MVD were shown to be independent prognostic parameters for patients' survival.","['Zhelyazkova, A G', 'Tonchev, A B', 'Kolova, P', 'Ivanova, L', 'Gercheva, L']","['Zhelyazkova AG', 'Tonchev AB', 'Kolova P', 'Ivanova L', 'Gercheva L']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, University Hospital St. Marina Varna, Varna University of Medicine, Varna, Bulgaria. azhelyazkova@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (MET protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*pathology', 'Microvessels/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/blood', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/metabolism']",2008/07/09 09:00,2009/02/05 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['790656406 [pii]', '10.1080/00365510701854991 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2008;68(6):492-500. doi: 10.1080/00365510701854991.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMPDH activity may be a promising pharmacodynamic biomarker during immunosuppressive and anticancer pharmacotherapy. The aim of the study was to investigate the impact of mycophenolic acid (MPA) and 6-thioguanosine (tGuO) on IMPDH basal activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We studied the IMPDH basal activity (i.e. the enzyme activity following inhibitor exposure, but measured in absence of the inhibitor) in response to increasing concentrations of the IMPDH inhibitor MPA and the antimetabolite tGuO in MOLT-4 human leukaemia cells. In parallel, IMPDH gene expression and cellular purine nucleotide concentrations were examined. RESULTS: A biphasic concentration-dependent influence of MPA on the IMPDH basal activity was observed. At concentrations < or =IC50, MPA increased the IMPDH basal activity. The increase was associated with elevated expression of IMPDH2. Despite increased expression, the basal enzyme activity decreased following exposure to high MPA concentrations. The IMPDH2 expression increased modestly in response to tGuO exposure. However, the IMPDH basal activity decreased when the cells were exposed to a proliferation-blocking tGuO concentration. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that IMPDH basal activity is influenced by MPA and tGuO, and suggest that reduced IMPDH basal activity is related to the proliferation-blocking effects of these agents.","['Vethe, N T', 'Bremer, S', 'Bergan, S']","['Vethe NT', 'Bremer S', 'Bergan S']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, Rikshospitalet Medical Centre, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Scand J Clin Lab Invest,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,0404375,"['0 (Purines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', 'C558LI0K8P (6-thioguanosine)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Guanosine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mycophenolic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Purines/metabolism', 'Thionucleosides/*pharmacology']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['786619735 [pii]', '10.1080/00365510701724871 [doi]']",ppublish,Scand J Clin Lab Invest. 2008;68(4):277-85. doi: 10.1080/00365510701724871.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports suggested potential association between regular use of NSAIDs and the risk of development of hematological malignancies. However, the data distinctly differ depending on type of NSAID used, period of its administration and type of malignancy. Regular use of aspirin and other NSAIDs was shown to correlate with reduced risk of lymphoid malignancies. Frequent use of aspirin was found to be associated with decreased risk of acute leukemia (AL) development. In contrast, correlation between long-term acetaminophen usage and increased incidence of AL and multiple myeloma (MM) was indicated. On the other hand, NSAIDs were found to exert anti-cancer effects, inhibiting proliferation and invasive growth or inducing cell apoptosis in several tumors, including hematologic malignancies. One of those agents, non-cyclooxygenase 2-inhibiting R-enantiomer of etodolac (SDX-101), exerts cytotoxic effects against chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and MM cells, and is currently investigated in phase II clinical trial in CLL. The indole-pyran analogue of SDX-101, SDX-308 (CEP-18082), showed more potent cytotoxicity than SDX-101 against MM cells and inhibited osteoclast formation and activity of mature osteoclasts. Thus, SDX-308 may be an ideal agent for bone disease in MM and related diseases. Another analogue of SDX-101, SDX-309, showed also significant anti-tumor activity in first preclinical studies. The potential role of NSAIDs in prevention and treatment of hematologic malignancies is the subject of this review.","['Robak, Pawel', 'Smolewski, Piotr', 'Robak, Tadeusz']","['Robak P', 'Smolewski P', 'Robak T']","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz and Copernicus Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland. robakttad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (SDX 308)', '0 (SDX 309)', '2M36281008 (Etodolac)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",IM,"['Acetaminophen/adverse effects', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*therapeutic use', 'Aspirin', 'Etodolac/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*prevention & control', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring', 'Humans']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['792860279 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802108854 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Aug;49(8):1452-62. doi: 10.1080/10428190802108854.,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In support of our previously published data, we have investigated the interactions between THC and anti-leukemia therapies and studied the role of the signalling pathways in mediating these effects. Results showed clear synergistic interactions between THC and the cytotoxic agents in leukemic cells. Additionally, exposure of cells to sub lethal levels of THC (1 microM) sensitised cells to these cytotoxic agents, by reducing IC(50) values by approximately 50%. Sensitisation appeared to be dependent upon the ability of THC to down regulate phosphorylated ERK, as cells dominantly expressive of MEK were not sensitised to the cytotoxic drugs by equi-molar amounts of THC. Overall, these results demonstrate for the first time that a combination approach with THC and established cytotoxic agents may enhance cell death in vitro. Additionally the MAPK/ERK pathway appears responsible in part for these effects.","['Liu, Wai M', 'Scott, Katherine A', 'Shamash, Jonathan', 'Joel, Simon', 'Powles, Thomas B']","['Liu WM', 'Scott KA', 'Shamash J', 'Joel S', 'Powles TB']","[""Department of Oncology, St George's University of London, Jenner Wing, London, UK. w.liu@sgul.ac.uk""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['7J8897W37S (Dronabinol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation', 'Dronabinol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['794665906 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802239188 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Sep;49(9):1800-9. doi: 10.1080/10428190802239188.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To delineate the effect of ANXA2 on the proteins that are probably associated with tumor development and metastasis by a credible experimental method, we generated an ANXA2 gene knockout tumor cell line, ANXA2(-/-) L5178Y, and compared the expression levels of plasmin, S100A10 and fascin in the generated cell line with in wild type of L5178Y at mRNA and protein levels. The results showed that the mRNA level of plasminogen (PLG) was not substantially changed in cultured ANXA2(-/-) cells, but the protein level of plasmin was significantly lower in the cultured ANXA2(-/-) cells than in cultured ANXA2(+/+) cells. For S100A10 and fascin, their mRNA and protein levels were significantly lower in the cultured ANXA2(-/-) cells than in cultured ANXA2(+/+) cells. Results indicate that ANXA2 introduces the generation or expression of plasmin, S100A10, and fascin in tumor cells. ANXA2 affects PLG/plasmin level by a way post transcription and may be an inducer or enhancer to fascin expression at transcription level. By the regulations, ANXA2 enhances the development, invasion, and metastasis of tumor. The detailed mechanism for the regulations above remains to be further investigated, but our results show the potential of ANXA2 as a new target molecule for the strategies of tumor biotherapy or tumor gene therapy.","['Hou, Yingchun', 'Yang, Lijuan', 'Mou, Maosen', 'Hou, Yang', 'Zhang, Airan', 'Pan, Ning', 'Qiang, Rongbin', 'Wei, Lili', 'Zhang, Nannan']","['Hou Y', 'Yang L', 'Mou M', 'Hou Y', 'Zhang A', 'Pan N', 'Qiang R', 'Wei L', 'Zhang N']","[""Department of Cell Biology, School of Life Sciences, Shaanxi Normal University, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China. ychhou@snnu.edu.cn""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,"['0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (S100 Proteins)', '0 (S100 calcium binding protein A10)', '146808-54-0 (fascin)', 'EC 3.4.21.7 (Fibrinolysin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Annexin A2/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Fibrinolysin/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microfilament Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'S100 Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/11/18 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['794094057 [pii]', '10.1080/07357900801898664 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Invest. 2008 Oct;26(8):809-15. doi: 10.1080/07357900801898664.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: After IRB approval, 30 consecutive patients had a frontal and lateral whole body radiography done with the Statscan system as a substitute for conventional radiographic skeletal survey. Both whole body images were obtained in less than five minutes. Images were retrospectively reviewed, independently, by three musculoskeletal radiologists. Findings were compared to information from all other available imaging studies. Final determinations were by consensus. RESULTS: Of the 30 patients in the study group, there were 18 men and 12 women with an age range from 37 to 88 years, average 60 years. Diagnoses were MGUS/multiple myeloma in 18 cases, lymphoma/leukemia in two cases, and cancer in 11 cases. Eleven of the Statscan exams were interpreted by all three radiologists as normal. The remaining 19 Statscan exams showed a total of 117 lesions (96 osteolytic and 21 osteoblastic). Ninety percent of these (106/117) were confirmed as areas of suspected metastatic disease or multifocal involvement by a variety of other imaging studies (radiographic bone survey-7, CT-33, MR-13, bone scan-4, PET/CT-8). CONCLUSION: The Statscan whole body radiographic system is a useful method for detecting focal metastatic disease in cancer patients and multifocal involvement in myeloma patients.","['Mulligan, Michael', 'Smith, Stacy', 'Talmi, Danit']","['Mulligan M', 'Smith S', 'Talmi D']","['Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, University of Maryland Medical School, Baltimore, Maryland 21201, USA.

Recently, we developed an effective method for haploidentical allo-HSCT achieving comparable outcomes to HLA-identical transplantation. AIM: To evaluate the outcomes of CML patients who underwent haploidentical allo-HSCT. METHODS: Ninety-three patients were treated with a modified busulfan (BU)/cyclophosphamide (CY) 2 regimen, including antithymocyte globulin followed by unmanipulated blood and marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Our data showed that the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was 64.52%, and grade III-IV was 26.45%, 61.79% had chronic GVHD, and 28.93% had extensive chronic GVHD. Non-relapse mortality varied at 8.72% (100 days), 20.72% (1 year) and 20.72% (2 years). Probability of 1-year and 4-year leukemia-free survival was similar in chronic phase (CP) 1, CP2/CR2, accelerated phase, and blast crisis patients. Probability of 4-year overall survival varied as 76.5% (CP1), 85.7% (CP2/CR2), 73.3% (accelerated phase), and 61.5% (blast crisis). Multivariate analysis indicated that factors affecting transplantation outcomes were HLA-B+DR mismatches versus others for II-III acute GVHD and III-IV acute GVHD, the stage of disease at transplantation for relapse, and the time from diagnosis to transplantation for leukemia-free survival, overall survival, and transplantation-related mortality. In our protocol, survival of HSCT for advanced CML was similar to stable stage.

Fanconi anaemia (FA) patients have an inherited defect in this pathway and are strongly predisposed to the development of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Studies in sporadic cancers have shown promoter methylation of the FANCF gene in a significant proportion of various solid tumours. However, only a single leukaemic case with methylation of one of the FA-BRCA genes has been described to date, i.e. methylation of FANCF in cell line CHRF-288. We investigated the presence of aberrant methylation in 11 FA-BRCA genes in sporadic cases of leukaemia. METHODS: We analyzed promoter methylation in 143 AML bone marrow samples and 97 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) samples using methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA). Samples with aberrant methylation were further analyzed by bisulphite sequencing and tested for mitomycin C sensitivity using Colony Forming Units assays. RESULTS: MS-MLPA showed promoter methylation of FANCC in one AML and three ALL samples, while FANCL was found methylated in one ALL sample. Bisulphite sequencing of promoter regions confirmed hypermethylation in all cases. In addition, samples with hypermethylation of either FANCC or FANCL appeared more sensitive towards mitomycin C in Colony Forming Units assays, compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Hypermethylation of promoter regions from FA-BRCA genes does occur in sporadic leukaemia, albeit infrequently. Hypermethylation was found to result in hypersensitivity towards DNA cross-linking agents, a hallmark of the FA cellular phenotype, suggesting that these samples displayed chromosomal instability. This instability may have contributed to the occurrence of the leukaemia. In addition, this is the first report to describe hypermethylation of FANCC and FANCL. This warrants the investigation of multiple FA-BRCA genes in other malignancies.","['Hess, C J', 'Ameziane, N', 'Schuurhuis, G J', 'Errami, A', 'Denkers, F', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Cloos, J', 'Joenje, H', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Waisfisz, Q']","['Hess CJ', 'Ameziane N', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Errami A', 'Denkers F', 'Kaspers GJ', 'Cloos J', 'Joenje H', 'Reinhardt D', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Waisfisz Q']","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,Cell Oncol,Cellular oncology : the official journal of the International Society for Cellular Oncology,101219418,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (FANCC protein, human)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DNA Modification Methylases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (FANCL protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group L Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/therapeutic use', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Modification Methylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group C Protein/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group L Protein/*genetics', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Mitomycin/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.3233/clo-2008-0426 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Oncol. 2008;30(4):299-306. doi: 10.3233/clo-2008-0426.,,,PMC4618910,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only a few small studies have assessed clinical characteristics and prognosis for familial patients, with inconsistent findings. METHODS: Using population-based registries from Sweden and Denmark, 7,749 patients with CLL, 7,476 patients with HL, and 25,801 patients with NHL with linkable first-degree relatives were identified. Kaplan-Meier curves were constructed to compare survival in patients with lymphoma with and without a family history of lymphoma. The risk of dying was assessed using adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. RESULTS: We found 85 patients with CLL (1.10%), 95 patients with HL (1.28%), and 206 patients with NHL (0.80%) with a family history of any lymphoma. Five-year mortality was similar for patients with CLL (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.72), HL (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.49 to 1.25), and NHL (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.12) versus without a family history of any lymphoma. Mortality was also similar for patients with versus without a family history of the same lymphoma. T-cell/anaplastic lymphoma patients with a family history of NHL had poorer outcome 5-years after diagnosis (HR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.65 to 17.52). Results were similar for 10 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: With the exception of T-cell/anaplastic lymphoma, survival patterns for patients with CLL, HL, and NHL with a family history of lymphoma were similar to those for sporadic patients, suggesting that most familial lymphomas do not have an altered clinical course. Our findings provide no evidence to modify therapeutic strategies for patients with CLL, HL, or NHL based solely on family history.","['Anderson, Lesley A', 'Pfeiffer, Ruth M', 'Rapkin, Joshua S', 'Gridley, Gloria', 'Mellemkjaer, Lene', 'Hemminki, Kari', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Caporaso, Neil E', 'Landgren, Ola']","['Anderson LA', 'Pfeiffer RM', 'Rapkin JS', 'Gridley G', 'Mellemkjaer L', 'Hemminki K', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Caporaso NE', 'Landgren O']","['Viral Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. l.anderson@qub.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080707,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*mortality', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Registries', 'Sex Distribution', 'Survival Rate', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.14.6571 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.6571 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 20;26(30):4958-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.6571.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Most patients had MS presenting in conjunction with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or after AML. Six patients had isolated MS. The median time between diagnosis and alloHSCT was 8 months (range, 2.8 to 67). Forty patients were in complete remission (CR) at time of alloHSCT. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 33 (range, 1 to 182) months, the Kaplan-Meier estimates of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival were 47% (95% CI, 33% to 61%) and 36% (95% CI, 24% to 50%) at 5 years. Twenty patients (39%) relapsed at a median of 204 (range, 35 to 1151) days after alloHSCT, with relapse being the major cause of death.

The effects of autologous (AuSCT) or allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) are still under evaluation. Minimal residual disease (MRD) states may be essential for assigning patients to therapy-dependent risk categories. PATIENTS AND METHODS: By multiparametric flow cytometry, we assessed the levels of MRD in 142 patients with AML who achieved complete remission after intensive chemotherapy. RESULTS: A level of 3.5 x 10(-4) residual leukemia cells (RLCs) after consolidation therapy was established to identify MRD-negative and MRD-positive cases, with 5-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rates of 60% and 16%, respectively (P < .0001) and overall survival (OS) rates of 62% and 23%, respectively (P = .0001). Of patients (n = 77) who underwent a transplantation procedure (56 AuSCT and 21 SCT procedures); 42 patients (55%) were MRD positive (28 patients who underwent AuSCT and 14 patients who underwent SCT) and 35 patients (45%) were MRD negative (28 patients who underwent AuSCT and seven who underwent SCT). MRD-negative patients had a favorable prognosis, with only eight (22%) of 35 patients experiencing relapse, whereas 29 (69%) of 42 MRD-positive patients experienced relapse (P < .0001). In this high-risk group of 42 patients, we observed that 23 (82%) of 28 of those who underwent AuSCT experienced relapse, whereas six (43%) of 14 who underwent SCT experienced relapse (P = .014). Patients who underwent SCT also had a higher likelihood of RFS (47% v 14%). CONCLUSION: A threshold of 3.5 x 10(-4) RLCs postconsolidation is critical for predicting disease outcome. MRD-negative patients have a good outcome regardless of the type of transplant they receive.

Approximately 30-40% of adult cows in the United States are infected by this oncogenic C-type retrovirus and 1-5% of animals will eventually develop a malignant lymphoma. BLV, like the human and simian T cell leukemia viruses, is a deltaretrovirus but, in contrast with the latter, the BLV receptor remains unidentified. In this study, we demonstrate that the amino-terminal 182 residues of the BLV envelope glycoprotein surface unit encompasses the receptor-binding domain. A bona fide interaction of this receptor-binding domain with the BLV receptor was demonstrated by specific interference with BLV, but not human T cell leukemia virus, envelope glycoprotein-mediated binding. We generated a rabbit Ig Fc-tagged BLV receptor-binding domain construct and ascertained that the ligand binds the BLV receptor on target cells from multiple species. Using this tool, we determined that the BLV-binding receptor is expressed on differentiating pro/pre-B cells in mouse bone marrow. However, the receptor was not detected on mature/quiescent B cells but was induced upon B cell activation. Activation of human B and T lymphocytes also induced surface BLV-binding receptor expression and required de novo protein synthesis. Receptor levels were down-regulated as activated lymphocytes returned to quiescence. In the human thymus, BLV-binding receptor expression was specifically detected on thymocytes responding to the IL-7 cytokine. Thus, expression of the BLV-binding receptor is a marker of enhanced metabolic activity in B cells, T cells, and thymocytes.","['Lavanya, Madakasira', 'Kinet, Sandrina', 'Montel-Hagen, Amelie', 'Mongellaz, Cedric', 'Battini, Jean-Luc', 'Sitbon, Marc', 'Taylor, Naomi']","['Lavanya M', 'Kinet S', 'Montel-Hagen A', 'Mongellaz C', 'Battini JL', 'Sitbon M', 'Taylor N']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Unite Mixte de Recherche 5535/IFR 24, Universite Montpellier I and II, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (BLVR protein, Bos taurus)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deltaretrovirus/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-7/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland', 'Up-Regulation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/2/891 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.2.891 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jul 15;181(2):891-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.2.891.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This makes the MRN complex an important guard of genome stability. Hypomorphic mutations in NBS1 result in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), which is characterized by, among other things, an increased predisposition to malignancies, especially leukemia/lymphoma. Relatives of NBS patients carrying heterozygous mutations are also more prone to cancer development. This review summarizes several studies searching for associations between heterozygous mutations in NBS1, MRE11, and RAD50 and cancer and examining the levels of expression of proteins coded by these genes in tumor tissues. The results indicate that both decreased and increased expression of NBS1 may contribute to tumorigenesis, whereas overexpressed RAD50 has an anti-tumoric effect. MRE11 and RAD50 are also affected in tumors with microsatellite instability. However, the outcomes of association studies, which concerned primarily lymphomas/leukemias and breast cancer, were inconclusive. Heterozygous NBS1 mutations and molecular variants 657del5, I171V, R215W and E185Q were most commonly analyzed. Among these, an association with cancer was found most frequently for 657del5 (in leukemia/lymphoma and breast cancer) and I171V (in leukemia, breast, head and neck and colorectal cancers); however, other studies gave contradictory results. For other NBS1 as well as MRE11 and RAD50 variants, too little data were available to assess their role in cancer risk. Overall, the results suggest that heterozygous MRN complex mutations and molecular variants may contribute only to a limited fraction of tumors. This may be caused by several factors: various frequencies of the variants in specific populations, different criteria used for selection of control groups, possible effects of environmental factors, and potential interactions with variants of other low-risk genes. These issues, as well as the impact of the alterations on protein function, need to be addressed in future studies.","['Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk, Agnieszka']",['Dzikiewicz-Krawczyk A'],"['Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, 60-479 Poznan Strzeszynska 32, Poland. krawczyk@man.poznan.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080623,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MRE11 protein, human)', '0 (NBN protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (MRE11 Homologue Protein)', 'EC 3.6.- (Acid Anhydride Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.- (Rad50 protein, human)', 'EC 6.5.1.- (DNA Repair Enzymes)']",IM,"['Acid Anhydride Hydrolases', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', '*DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Enzymes/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'MRE11 Homologue Protein', 'Models, Biological', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5742(08)00077-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Sep-Oct;659(3):262-73. doi: 10.1016/j.mrrev.2008.05.005.

Especially, the therapeutic effect on solid carcinoma has been paid more close attention to. The present study is to evaluate the effect of As2O3 on human colorectal carcinoma cells (LS-174T cell) and the activity of telomerase in vitro and in vivo. This research made use of the electron microscope, polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (PCR-ELISA), fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), MTT in vitro and in vivo (LS-174T xenograft model of nude mice). With the increasing concentration of As2O3, the ratio of living cells to dead cells decreased significantly, and the IC50 value was 5.23micromol/L; cells of the experimental groups endured a series of morphological changes similar to the features of apoptosis. Apoptosis curve of FACS pictures appeared after 24h, and the cells showed apoptosis in a time-dependent manner; As2O3 can inhibit the activity of telomerase of the cell extraction, obviously, in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner after 24h. As to the inhibition impact of As2O3 on the xenograft model of nude mice in the two indexes, tumor volume and weight, there was a significant difference between As2O3 and the control group; there was no difference between As2O3 and the fluorouracil (5-FU) group; in the group of peritoneal injections of As2O3, the cancer cells connected loosely with each other, nucleus changed markedly, and heterochromatin concentrated under the nucleus membrane. From the in vitro and in vivo experiment, we can see that As2O3 inhibited LS-174T cell growth mainly by inducing cell apoptosis, partly by the inhibition of telomerase activity.","['Wang, Xishan', 'Wang, Guiyu', 'Dong, Deli', 'Fu, Songbin', 'Yang, Baofeng']","['Wang X', 'Wang G', 'Dong D', 'Fu S', 'Yang B']","['Department of Abdominal Surgery, The Affiliated Tumor Hospital, Harbin Medical University, Harbin 150081, China. wxshan1208@yahoo.com.cn']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080707,Germany,Exp Toxicol Pathol,Experimental and toxicologic pathology : official journal of the Gesellschaft fur Toxikologische Pathologie,9208920,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Cytoplasmic Structures/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Telomerase/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2007/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0940-2993(08)00076-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.etp.2008.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Toxicol Pathol. 2008 Sep;60(6):481-8. doi: 10.1016/j.etp.2008.04.011.

The present study further examined the anti-adhesive activity in various assays by using human leukemia T cell line Jurkat cells. We found that astilbin inhibited the adhesion of Con A or PMA-activated Jurkat cells to fibronectin, type IV collagen, hyaluronic acid, and [corrected] ECV-304 cells. Astilbin inhibited the adhesion of Jurkat cells to PMA-activated but not non-activated ECV-304 cells without any influence on the survival of the ECV-304 cells and Jurkat cells. Astilbin also inhibited the CD44 expression and TNF-alpha production in Jurkat cells. In the co-culture assay between Jurkat cells and ECV-304 cells, the MMP-9 secretion from Jurkat cells was inhibited after astilbin-treatment, while the exogenous TNF-alpha increased the MMP-9 secretion in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that the inhibition of T lymphocyte adhesion by astilbin may be related to the reduction of the CD44 expression and TNF-alpha production in the cells, which may further cause a decreased MMP-9 secretion.","['Yi, Hong-Wei', 'Lu, Xiao-Min', 'Fang, Feng', 'Wang, Jun', 'Xu, Qiang']","['Yi HW', 'Lu XM', 'Fang F', 'Wang J', 'Xu Q']","['State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Nanjing University, 22 Hankou Road, Nanjing 210093, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080709,Netherlands,Int Immunopharmacol,International immunopharmacology,100965259,"['0 (Flavonols)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '29838-67-3 (astilbin)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Cell Adhesion/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flavonols/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2008/07/09 09:00,2008/11/11 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/04/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1567-5769(08)00182-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.intimp.2008.06.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Int Immunopharmacol. 2008 Oct;8(10):1467-74. doi: 10.1016/j.intimp.2008.06.006.

Little is known about changes in biological characters of hematological malignancies, especially leukemia. This study was to explore the influence of RNA interference (RNAi) targeting HIF-1alpha on sensitivity of human chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) K562 cells towards homoharringtonine (HHT). METHODS: HIF-1alpha short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was constructed using pSilencer 2.1-U6 hygro vector and transfected into K562 cells. Positive clones were screened using hygromycin. After inhibition of HIF-1alpha, expressions of its target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glucose transporter-1 (Glut-1), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sensitivity of K562 cells to HHT was detected by MTT assay. RESULTS: HIF-1alpha expression was inhibited at both mRNA and protein levels after transfection of RNAi HIF-1alpha, which subsequently caused a dramatic decrease in VEGF, Glut-1, PGK, and P-gp under hypoxic conditions. In addition, HIF-1alpha inhibition was found to increase drug sensitivity of K562 cells to HHT. CONCLUSION: HIF-1alpha inhibition may result in a decrease of genes related to angiogenesis and glycolysis metabolism and an increase of drug sensitivity to HHT in K562 cells.","['Li, Bing-Zong', 'Zhuang, Wen-Zhuo', 'Chen, Ping', 'Fu, Jin-Xiang']","['Li BZ', 'Zhuang WZ', 'Chen P', 'Fu JX']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215004, P R China.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/biosynthesis', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*RNA Interference', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2008/07/09 09:00,2009/01/15 09:00,['2008/07/09 09:00'],"['2008/07/09 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [entrez]']",['1000-467X200807723 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2008 Jul;27(7):723-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over-expression of ROR1 gene, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase family, has recently been reported in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Wilms' tumor gene 1 (WT1) has long been known as a universal TAA expressed in a variety of solid and hematopoietic malignancies. In the present study, the expression profile of ROR1 and WT1 was investigated in different immunophenotypic subsets of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients. RT-PCR method was used to determine the ROR1 and WT1 genes expression in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 51 newly diagnosed Iranian B-ALL patients. Isolated tumor cells from all patients were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Based on immunophenotypic results, our B-ALL patients were classified in four differentiation subsets; Pro-B (n = 7), Pre-B I (n = 29), Pre-B II (n = 13) and Immature/mature B-ALL (n = 2). Although ROR1 was over-expressed in more mature subsets (16.7%, 42.9%, 45.5% and 100%, respectively), WT1 was more represented in immature subsets of B-ALL patients (57.1%, 64.3%, 38.5% and 0%, respectively). Comparison of the frequency of ROR1 and WT1 positive samples at each immunophenotypic subtype revealed statistically significant difference only in Pre B I subtype (p = 0.02). Our results suggest that expression of ROR1 and WT1 in B-ALL is associated with the differentiation stage of the leukemic cells.","['Shabani, Mahdi', 'Asgarian-Omran, Hossein', 'Vossough, Parvaneh', 'Sharifian, Ramazan A', 'Faranoush, Mohammad', 'Ghragozlou, Soheila', 'Khoshnoodi, Jalal', 'Roohi, Azam', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Rabbani, Hodjatallah', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Shabani M', 'Asgarian-Omran H', 'Vossough P', 'Sharifian RA', 'Faranoush M', 'Ghragozlou S', 'Khoshnoodi J', 'Roohi A', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Mellstedt H', 'Rabbani H', 'Shokri F']","['Department of Immunology, School of Public Health, Medical Sciences/University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/classification/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Iran', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['794747198 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802124000 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jul;49(7):1360-7. doi: 10.1080/10428190802124000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of clinical and prognostic aspects in this subgroup of patients as compared with those of primarily diagnosed MD-CMML patients, showed some significant differences in Hb level, platelet count, percentage of immature circulating precursor (IPC), bone marrow blastosis and trilineage dysplasia. Median survival for present group of patients was 33 months compared with 20 months for MD-CMML. Different prognostic scores were applied for evaluation of risk distribution and relative impact on survival prediction. We suggest on a possible atypical presentation of CMML and indicate a careful attention to be addressed to myelodysplastic patients who develop peripheral monocytosis, who might have a CMML variant, with more favourable prognosis and prolonged survival. Furthermore, we believe this is a further evidence for the arbitrary nature of current classification systems, which definitely exclude CMML from myelodysplastic syndromes.","['Breccia, M', 'Cannella, L', 'Frustaci, A', 'Stefanizzi, C', ""D'Elia, G M"", 'Alimena, G']","['Breccia M', 'Cannella L', 'Frustaci A', 'Stefanizzi C', ""D'Elia GM"", 'Alimena G']","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*classification/diagnosis/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*classification', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/11/01 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['792861699 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802123499 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jul;49(7):1292-6. doi: 10.1080/10428190802123499.,,,,,,"['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jul;49(7):1225-7.

Both recipient and donor were cytomegalovirus (CMV) seropositive. Both episodes occurred late post-grafting during a phase of complete immunological recovery with sufficient numbers of circulating CMV-specific clones. Antiviral treatment with foscarnet and ganciclovir was successful but prolonged treatment was required to prevent relapses. We hypothesize that this complication was more related to an immune reconstitution process than to an immune-deficient state post-grafting. We conclude that CMV retinitis is a late complication of HSCT that can occur despite satisfactory immune reconstitution. Usually, it is responsive to antiviral therapy.

These abnormalities significantly influence the prognosis of the disease. Hence, a thorough genetic work-up is an essential constituent of standard diagnostic procedures. Core binding factor (CBF) leukemias denote AMLs with chromosomal aberrations disrupting one of the CBF transcription factor genes; the most common examples are translocation t(8;21) and inversion inv(16), which result in the generation of the AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion proteins, respectively. However, in murine models, these alterations alone do not suffice to generate full-blown leukemia, but rather, complementary events are required. In fact, a substantial proportion of primary CBF leukemias display additional activating mutations, mostly of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-KIT. The awareness of the impact and prognostic relevance of these 'second hits' is increasing with a wider range of mutations tested in clinical trials. Furthermore, novel agents targeting RTKs are emanating rapidly and entering therapeutic regimens. Here, we present a concise review on complementing mutations in CBF leukemias including pathophysiology, mouse models, and clinical implications.","['Muller, A M S', 'Duque, J', 'Shizuru, J A', 'Lubbert, M']","['Muller AM', 'Duque J', 'Shizuru JA', 'Lubbert M']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Baden Wuerttemberg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080707,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Core Binding Factors/*genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008196 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.196 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Oct 2;27(44):5759-73. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.196.

PMX1 has never been linked to leukemia on its own, raising the possibility of unique mechanisms underlying the oncogenicity of NUP98-PMX1. To elucidate the leukemogenic potential of NUP98-PMX1, we compared the effects of PMX1 and NUP98-PMX1 and, through strategic mutations, the involvement of the SRE in NUP98-PMX1-mediated leukemia. NUP98-PMX1, but not PMX1, had potent ability to impair differentiation, promote proliferation of myeloid progenitors, induce lethal myeloproliferative disease and to activate a number of genes previously linked to leukemic stem cells. Similar to NUP98-HOX fusions, the transforming potential of NUP98-PMX1 required the NUP98 portion and DNA-binding capability of the PMX1 homeodomain and collaborated with Meis1 to induce more rapid onset myeloproliferative-like myeloid leukemia. The transforming activity of NUP98-PMX1 was independent of its ability to interact with SRF. These findings provide novel evidence of the contributory role of the NUP98 sequence in conferring leukemogenic properties on a partner gene and point to common leukemogenic pathways for NUP98-PMX1 and NUP98-clustered HOX fusions.","['Hirose, K', 'Abramovich, C', 'Argiropoulos, B', 'Humphries, R K']","['Hirose K', 'Abramovich C', 'Argiropoulos B', 'Humphries RK']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080707,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NUP98-PMX1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup98 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PRRX1 protein, human)', '0 (Serum Response Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Serum Response Factor/*metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008210 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.210 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Oct 9;27(46):6056-67. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.210.

Clinical resistance is frequently observed, and adverse effects are common. To date, no practical assay exists to identify patients likely to derive benefit from F-ara-A. We previously reported that high mRNA levels encoding human concentrative nucleoside transporter 3 (hCNT3) protein in CLL correlated with clinical resistance to F-ara-A. This study explores the value of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for hCNT3 as a marker of F-ara-A resistance in CLL. We studied 36 CLL patients who received F-ara-A monotherapy and had suitable pre-F-ara-A tissue available. IHC was performed with validated hCNT3-specific monoclonal antibodies and quantitatively scored by a hematopathologist blinded to clinical outcomes. Relationships between hCNT3 staining in CLL cells and time to progression (TTP), overall response (OR), and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Dichotomization of quantitative hCNT3 staining showed that subjects with high hCNT3 IHC scores had a significantly shorter TTP with F-ara-A treatment compared to those with a low score (hazard ratio, HR, 3.16; P=0.006). Median TTP was 4.7 vs 11.2 months, respectively. On multivariate analysis, hCNT3 score was the only clinical parameter independently associated with TTP (HR, 3.12; P=0.01). OR and OS did not differ significantly between the dichotomized groups. We found a strong relationship between IHC staining of hCNT3 and clinical resistance to F-ara-A therapy in CLL. If confirmed, IHC for hCNT3 may be routinely used to predict those patients unlikely to benefit from F-ara-A, thereby avoiding F-ara-A-related toxicities.","['Tsang, Roger Y', 'Santos, Cheryl', 'Ghosh, Sunita', 'Dabbagh, Laith', 'King, Karen', 'Young, James', 'Cass, Carol E', 'Mackey, John R', 'Lai, Raymond']","['Tsang RY', 'Santos C', 'Ghosh S', 'Dabbagh L', 'King K', 'Young J', 'Cass CE', 'Mackey JR', 'Lai R']","['Department of Oncology, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080704,United States,Mod Pathol,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc",8806605,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (cif nucleoside transporter)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Single-Blind Method', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2008/07/08 09:00,2009/02/04 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/04 09:00 [medline]']","['modpathol2008110 [pii]', '10.1038/modpathol.2008.110 [doi]']",ppublish,Mod Pathol. 2008 Nov;21(11):1387-93. doi: 10.1038/modpathol.2008.110.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a highly sensitive molecular genetic technique, which enables to detect break point cluster region--Abelson (BCR-ABL) complex and minimal residual disease in all Ph positive CML patients not only in metaphase but also in interphase cells. AIMS: To detect Ph chromosome in CML patients by the use of conventional cytogenetics and FISH. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The bone marrow samples were collected in heparinised syringe from 35 diagnosed CML patients and transported to cytogenetic laboratory for chromosomal analysis. Conventional karyotype was prepared by direct harvesting and short-term culture. The FISH analysis was carried out on interphase cells of two patients to confirm the cytogenetic diagnosis. RESULTS: Out of 35 CML patients, 17 (49.9%) were 100% Philadelphia positive, 10(28.5%) were 50-70% Ph+ mosaics and 3(9%) were 100% Ph negative. In 5 patients (14.25%) cytogenetic analysis failed to confirm the presence or absence of Ph chromosome. FISH was carried out in interphase cells from bone marrow preparations of two patients. The signals for BCR-ABL fusion gene was absent in Ph- negative CML patients. In Ph positive patients, the FISH analysis detected BCR-ABL fusion gene seen as a yellow signal on interphase cells. CONCLUSION: Conventional cytogenetics is a useful method for detection of Ph chromosome in metaphase stage of cell division. FISH can be used in interphase stage of cell division for the same purpose.","['Jha, C B', 'Kucheria, K', 'Choudhary, V P']","['Jha CB', 'Kucheria K', 'Choudhary VP']","['Department of Anatomy, B. P.

Although many solid and hematologic cancers may involve the renal parenchyma, clinical sequelae are usually not prominent. Published reports cite membranous nephropathy as the most common malignancy-associated glomerulopathy, occurring with many carcinomas and occasionally with leukemia and lymphoma followed by minimal change disease. Rarely membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) has been reported in patients with malignancy. The mechanism by which malignancy induces disease remains unproved, but may involve deposition of tumor antigen in the subepithelial space with in situ immune complex formation and subsequent complement activation. Treatment of the underlying malignancy may lead to resolution of nephrotic syndrome, lending indirect support to this theory. We report a rare autopsy case of a patient with metastatic carcinoma (with unknown primary) associated with MPGN. The association between MPGN and metastatic carcinoma with unknown primary is uncommon and has not been previously reported in the literature.","['Gupta, Kirti', 'Nada, Ritambhra', 'Das, Ashim', 'Kumar, Mahi Sushil']","['Gupta K', 'Nada R', 'Das A', 'Kumar MS']","['Department of Histopathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, India. kirtigupta10@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/complications/pathology', 'Adult', 'Glomerulonephritis, Membranoproliferative/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Unknown Primary/*complications/pathology', 'Splenic Neoplasms/complications/pathology']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4103/0377-4929.41665 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2008 Apr-Jun;51(2):230-3. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.41665.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first national meeting on ""Guidelines for Immunophenotyping of Hematolymphoid Neoplasms by Flow Cytometry"" was held on 14 March 2008 in Mumbai, India. AIM: To achieve uniformity in the laboratory practice regarding antibody panel selection in diagnosing hematolymphoid neoplasms. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: Members of the Inter-Laboratory Comparison Program (ILCP) group in Mumbai prepared a draft regarding immunophenotypic panel selection for acute leukemias (ALs) and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPDs), which was further circulated among national and international cytometrists, hematopathologists, and oncologists for their written inputs, suggestions, proposed modifications; as well as their indications, if any, of the recommendations not being acceptable. Practice-based questionnaire was circulated among all the participants. RESULTS: Consensus was attained, and the panel recommended the use of a minimal screening panel, followed by a secondary directed panel. The aim of the minimal screening panel would be to provide a diagnosis of all commonly occurring hematolymphoid neoplasms without the need of additional antibodies in most cases. CONCLUSION: Thus we could attain a consensus for our guidelines in selecting panels for ALs and CLPDs. The guideline is an attempt to formulate a minimal panel for immunophenotyping of hematolymphoid neoplasms. Laboratories are encouraged to add additional antibodies to the above panel to increase the sensitivity; however, they should refrain from immunophenotyping with fewer antibodies. This national guideline hopefully brings about uniformity and comparability in reporting of leukemia and lymphoma and bridges the divide between low-cost reporting and an accurate diagnosis.","['Gujral, Sumeet', 'Subramanian, P G', 'Patkar, Nikhil', 'Badrinath, Y', 'Kumar, Ashok', 'Tembhare, Prashant', 'Vazifdar, Archana', 'Khodaiji, Shenaj', 'Madkaikar, Manisha', 'Ghosh, Kanjaksha', 'Yargop, Mamta', 'Dasgupta, Amar']","['Gujral S', 'Subramanian PG', 'Patkar N', 'Badrinath Y', 'Kumar A', 'Tembhare P', 'Vazifdar A', 'Khodaiji S', 'Madkaikar M', 'Ghosh K', 'Yargop M', 'Dasgupta A']","['Department of Pathology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. s_gujral@hotmail.com']",['eng'],['Congress'],,India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Consensus', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'India', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.4103/0377-4929.41602 [doi]'],ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2008 Apr-Jun;51(2):161-6. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.41602.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental evidence of the oncogenic potential of the nucleophosmin mutant is, however, still lacking, and it is unclear whether other genetic lesion(s), e.g. FLT3 internal tandem duplication, cooperate with NPM1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia development. An analysis of age-specific incidence, together with mathematical modeling of acute myeloid leukemia epidemiology, can help to uncover the number of genetic events needed to cause leukemia. We collected data on age at diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia patients from five European Centers in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, and determined the age-specific incidence of AML with mutated NPM1 (a total of 1,444 cases) for each country. Linear regression of the curves representing age-specific rates of diagnosis per year showed similar slopes of about 4 on a double logarithmic scale. We then adapted a previously designed mathematical model of hematopoietic tumorigenesis to analyze the age incidence of acute myeloid leukemia with mutated NPM1 and found that a one-mutation model can explain the incidence curve of this leukemia entity. This model fits with the hypothesis that NPMc(+) acute myeloid leukemia arises from an NPM1 mutation with haploinsufficiency of the wild-type NPM1 allele.","['Liso, Arcangelo', 'Castiglione, Filippo', 'Cappuccio, Antonio', 'Stracci, Fabrizio', 'Schlenk, Richard F', 'Amadori, Sergio', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Dohner, Konstanze', 'Martelli, Massimo F', 'Schaich, Markus', 'Krauter, Jurgen', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Martelli, Maria P', 'Bolli, Niccolo', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Ehninger, Gerhard', 'Mandelli, Franco', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Michor, Franziska', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Liso A', 'Castiglione F', 'Cappuccio A', 'Stracci F', 'Schlenk RF', 'Amadori S', 'Thiede C', 'Schnittger S', 'Valk PJ', 'Dohner K', 'Martelli MF', 'Schaich M', 'Krauter J', 'Ganser A', 'Martelli MP', 'Bolli N', 'Lowenberg B', 'Haferlach T', 'Ehninger G', 'Mandelli F', 'Dohner H', 'Michor F', 'Falini B']","['Institute of Hematology, University of Foggia, Foggia, Italy. a.liso@medicina.unifg.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080704,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Europe', 'Gene Duplication', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Genetic', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Registries', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/10/10 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.13209 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13209 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2008 Aug;93(8):1219-26. doi: 10.3324/haematol.13209.

A total of 911 chronic myeloid leukemia patients after failure or suboptimal response to imatinib were screened for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphism analysis was based on the search for nucleotide changes in corresponding normal, non-translocated ABL alleles by ABL allele-specific PCR following mutation analysis. In addition to the K247R polymorphism we uncovered five new single nucleotide polymorphisms within the BCR-ABL kinase domain; two of them led to amino acid changes.

However, it has been reported that many CML patients with blast cell crisis treated with STI571 relapsed and became resistant to STI571. In order to understand the possible molecular mechanisms underlying STI571 resistance caused by ABL gene mutations, we investigated 19 patients (18 CML patients and 1 Ph (+) ALL patient) who either relapsed after initial response or had no response to STI571 treatment. We used polymerase chain reaction followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis, dHPLC, and direct DNA sequencing to analyze any possible mutations in exons 5 to 9 of the ABL gene. Our results showed that 5 out of 19 patients had various mutations between exons 5 and 7 of the ABL gene. The Ph (+) ALL patient had a Glu255Lys mutation in exon 5 and a Thr315Ile mutation in exon 7. The Glu255Lys substitution has a G to A change, and the Thr315Ile substitution has a C to T change in the ABL gene. The other unique mutations found in this study include: Tyr253His, Met351Thr, GAA tri-nucleotides insertion, and Leu213Pro.","['Chien, Ju-Huei', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Chen, Rong-Long', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Lee, Chan Ping']","['Chien JH', 'Tang JL', 'Chen RL', 'Li CC', 'Lee CP']","['Institute of Medical Science, Tzu Chi University, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080707,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Child', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2007/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00224-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Nov;32(11):1724-34. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.023.

Along with cytotoxicity in Jurkat T cells, several apoptotic events including mitochondrial cytochrome c release, activation of caspase-9, -3, and -8, PARP degradation, and DNA fragmentation were induced. The cytotoxicity of 17alpha-E(2) was not blocked by the anti-Fas neutralizing antibody ZB-4. While undergoing apoptosis, there was a remarkable accumulation of G(2)/M cells with the upregulatoin of cdc2 kinase activity, which was reflected in the Thr56 phosphorylation of Bcl-2. Dephosphorylation at Tyr15 and phosphorylation at Thr161 of cdc2, and significant increase in the cyclin B1 level were underlying factors for the cdc2 kinase activation. Whereas the 17alpha-E(2)-induced apoptosis was completely abrogated by overexpression of Bcl-2 or by pretreatment with the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, the accumulation of G(2)/M cells significantly increased. The caspase-8 inhibitor z-IETD-fmk failed to influence 17alpha-E(2)-mediated caspase-9 activation, but it markedly reduced caspase-3 activation and PARP degradation with the suppression of apoptosis, indicating the contribution of caspase-8; not as an upstream event of the mitochondrial cytochrome c release, but to caspase-3 activation. In the presence of hydroxyurea, which blocked the cell cycle progression at the G(1)/S boundary, 17alpha-E(2) failed to induce the G(2)/M arrest as well as apoptosis. These results demonstrate that the cytotoxicity of 17alpha-E(2) toward Jurkat T cells is attributable to apoptosis mainly induced in G(2)/M-arrested cells, in an ER-independent manner, via a mitochondria-dependent caspase pathway regulated by Bcl-2.","['Jun, Do Youn', 'Park, Hae Sun', 'Kim, Jun Seok', 'Kim, Jong Sik', 'Park, Wan', 'Song, Bang Ho', 'Kim, Hee-Sook', 'Taub, Dennis', 'Kim, Young Ho']","['Jun DY', 'Park HS', 'Kim JS', 'Kim JS', 'Park W', 'Song BH', 'Kim HS', 'Taub D', 'Kim YH']","['Laboratory of Immunobiology, Department of Microbiology, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080604,United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,"['4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Estradiol/therapeutic use/*toxicity', 'G2 Phase/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-008X(08)00244-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.taap.2008.05.023 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2008 Sep 15;231(3):401-12. doi: 10.1016/j.taap.2008.05.023.

Its proteolytic core, the 20S proteasome, has found to be attached also to the cell plasma membrane and certain observations are interpreted as to suggest that they may be released into the extracellular medium, e.g. in the alveolar lining fluid, epididymal fluid and possibly during the acrosome reaction. Proteasomes have also been detected in normal human blood plasma and designated circulating proteasomes; these have a comparatively low specific activity, a distinct pattern of subtypes and their exact origin is still enigmatic. In patients suffering from autoimmune diseases, malignant myeloproliferative syndromes, multiple myeloma, acute and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, solid tumour, sepsis or trauma, respectively, the concentration of circulating proteasomes has been found to be elevated, to correlate with the disease state and has even prognostic significance. Similarly, ubiquitin has been discovered as a normal component of human blood and seminal plasma and in ovarian follicular fluid. Increased concentrations were measured in diverse pathological situations, not only in blood plasma but also in cerebrospinal fluid, where it may have neuroprotective effects. As defective spermatozoa are covered with ubiquitin in the epididymal fluid, extracellular ubiquitination is proposed to be a mechanism for quality control in spermatogenesis. Growing evidence exists also for a participation of extracellular proteasomes and ubiquitin in the fertilization process.","['Sixt, Stephan U', 'Dahlmann, Burkhardt']","['Sixt SU', 'Dahlmann B']","['Klinik fur Anasthesiologie und Intensivmedizin, Universitat Duisburg-Essen, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080618,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Ubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Extracellular Space/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*blood', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism']",2008/07/08 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/09 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0925-4439(08)00128-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.06.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Dec;1782(12):817-23. doi: 10.1016/j.bbadis.2008.06.005.

In this study, we investigated whether PTX-2 induces apoptotic effects through suppression of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway in several leukemia cell types. PTX-2 significantly induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with PTX-2 also significantly increased caspase-3 activity and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, however caspase-3 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk significantly inhibited PTX-2-induced cell death. These data suggest that the activation of caspase-3 is associated with PTX-2-induced apoptosis. NF-kappaB has also been shown to inhibit apoptosis in response to chemotherapeutic agents. As examined by the DNA-binding of NF-kappaB activation, we found that PTX-2 suppressed constitutive NF-kappaB activation and determined by p65 and p50 nuclear translocation, and IkappaBalpha degradation through dephosphorylation of Akt. Attenuation of constitutive NF-kappaB activity by pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB nuclear translocation inhibitor, induced significantly apoptosis in the presence of PTX-2. In addition, treatment of PTX-2 down-regulated NF-kappaB-dependent gene expression, Cox-2, IAP-1, IAP-2 and XIAP, at the transcriptional and translational level. Taken together, these results suggest that anti-cancer activities induced by PTX-2 may be mediated in part through suppression of constitutive NF-kappaB activity.","['Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Heo, Moon-Soo', 'Lee, Jae-Dong', 'Jung, Jee Hyung', 'Kim, Se-Kwon', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Kim MO', 'Moon DO', 'Heo MS', 'Lee JD', 'Jung JH', 'Kim SK', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Department of Microbiology, College of Natural Sciences, Pusan National University, Busan, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080703,Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Pyrans)', '97564-91-5 (pectenotoxin 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Macrolides', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism/physiology', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2007/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3835(08)00431-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.05.034 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2008 Nov 18;271(1):25-33. doi: 10.1016/j.canlet.2008.05.034.

The TPMT gene is genetically polymorphic and the inverse relationship between TPMT activity and the risk of developing severe hematopoietic toxicity is well known. In this study, the entire coding sequence of TPMT, together with its 5'-flanking promoter region, was analysed in patients with an intermediate phenotype for thiopurine drug methylation. Four polymorphisms were identified, two previously described, c.356A>C (p.Lys(119)Thr, TPMT*9) and c.205C>G (p.Leu(69)Val, TPMT*21), and two novel missense mutations, c.537G>T (p.Gln(179)His, TPMT*24) and c.634T>C (p.Cys(212)Arg, TPMT*25). Structural investigations, using molecular modeling, were undertaken in an attempt to explain the potential impact of the amino acid substitutions on the structure and activity of the variant proteins. Additionally, in order to determine kinetic parameters (K(m) and V(max)) of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) methylation, the four variants were expressed in a recombinant yeast expression system. Assays were performed by HPLC and the results were compared with those of wild-type TPMT. The p.Leu(69)Val and the p.Cys(212)Arg substitutions encode recombinant enzymes with a significantly decreased intrinsic clearance compared to that of the wild-type protein, and, consequently, characterise non-functional alleles of TPMT. The p.Lys(119)Thr and the p.Gln(179)His substitutions do not affect significantly the catalytic activity of the corresponding variant proteins, which prevents to unambiguously describe these latter alleles as defective TPMT variants.","['Garat, A', 'Cauffiez, C', 'Renault, N', 'Lo-Guidice, J M', 'Allorge, D', 'Chevalier, D', 'Houdret, N', 'Chavatte, P', 'Loriot, M A', 'Gala, J L', 'Broly, F']","['Garat A', 'Cauffiez C', 'Renault N', 'Lo-Guidice JM', 'Allorge D', 'Chevalier D', 'Houdret N', 'Chavatte P', 'Loriot MA', 'Gala JL', 'Broly F']","[""Equipe d'accueil 2679, Faculte de Medecine de Lille, Pole Recherche, Lille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080518,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Purines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"[""5' Flanking Region/genetics"", '*Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA/genetics', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Leukocytes/enzymology/metabolism', 'Methyltransferases/chemistry/*genetics', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Mutation, Missense', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Purines/pharmacokinetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/enzymology/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Whites/genetics']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00300-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.009 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Aug 1;76(3):404-15. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.009.

We investigated the influence of an anticancer drug, STI571, on the efficacy of NER in removing UV-induced DNA damage. STI571 is used mostly in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and inhibits activity of the BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase, which is a hallmark of this disease. NER activity was examined in the BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines K562 and BV173 of myeloid and lymphoid origin, respectively, as well as in CCRF-CEM cells, which do not express BCR/ABL. A murine myeloid parental 32D cell line and its counterpart transfected with the BCR/ABL gene were also tested. NER activity was assessed in the cell extracts by use of an UV-irradiated plasmid as a substrate and by a modified single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay on UV-treated nucleoids. Additionally, quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the removal of UV-induced lesions from the p53 gene by intact cells. Results obtained from these experiments indicate that STI571 decreases the efficacy of NER in leukemic cells expressing BCR/ABL. Therefore, STI571 may overcome the drug resistance associated with increased DNA repair in BCR/ABL-positive leukemias.","['Sliwinski, Tomasz', 'Czechowska, Agnieszka', 'Szemraj, Janusz', 'Morawiec, Zbigniew', 'Skorski, Tomasz', 'Blasiak, Janusz']","['Sliwinski T', 'Czechowska A', 'Szemraj J', 'Morawiec Z', 'Skorski T', 'Blasiak J']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Banacha 12/16, 90-237 Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080614,Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Comet Assay', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2007/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1383-5718(08)00169-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.06.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2008 Jul 31;654(2):162-7. doi: 10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.06.002.

Although HBx is shown to activate COX-2, the functional consequences of this interaction in hepatocarcinogenesis remain unknown. Using an engineered hepatoma cell system in which the expression of wild-type p53 can be chemically modulated, we show here that COX-2 mediates HBx actions in opposing p53. Enforced expression of HBx sequestrates p53 in the cytoplasm and significantly abolishes p53-induced apoptosis. The anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein is suppressed by p53 but reactivated by HBx. The abrogation of apoptosis is completely reversed by specific COX-2 inhibition, suggesting that HBx blocks p53-induced apoptosis via activation of COX-2/PGE(2) pathway. We further show that COX-2 inhibition blocks HBx reactivation of Mcl-1, linking this protein to the anti-apoptotic function of COX-2. These results demonstrate that COX-2 is an important survival factor mediating the oncogenic actions of HBx. Over-expression of HBx and COX-2 may provide a selective clonal advantage for preneoplastic or neoplastic hepatocytes and contribute to the initiation and progression of HCC.","['Cheng, Alfred S L', 'Yu, Jun', 'Lai, Paul B S', 'Chan, Henry L Y', 'Sung, Joseph J Y']","['Cheng AS', 'Yu J', 'Lai PB', 'Chan HL', 'Sung JJ']","['Institute of Digestive Disease and Li Ka Shing Institute of Health Sciences, Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, New Territories, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (PTGS2 protein, human)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism/*virology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/metabolism/*virology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Precancerous Conditions/metabolism/virology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2008/06/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-291X(08)01254-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.098 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2008 Sep 19;374(2):175-80. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.098.

The challenge in analyzing large-scale expression data has been to extract biologically meaningful inferences regarding these processes - often represented as networks - in an environment where the datasets are often imperfect and biological noise can obscure the actual signal. Although many techniques have been developed in an attempt to address these issues, to date their ability to extract meaningful and predictive network relationships has been limited. Here we describe a method that draws on prior information about gene-gene interactions to infer biologically relevant pathways from microarray data. Our approach consists of using preliminary networks derived from the literature and/or protein-protein interaction data as seeds for a Bayesian network analysis of microarray results. RESULTS: Through a bootstrap analysis of gene expression data derived from a number of leukemia studies, we demonstrate that seeded Bayesian Networks have the ability to identify high-confidence gene-gene interactions which can then be validated by comparison to other sources of pathway data. CONCLUSION: The use of network seeds greatly improves the ability of Bayesian Network analysis to learn gene interaction networks from gene expression data. We demonstrate that the use of seeds derived from the biomedical literature or high-throughput protein-protein interaction data, or the combination, provides improvement over a standard Bayesian Network analysis, allowing networks involving dynamic processes to be deduced from the static snapshots of biological systems that represent the most common source of microarray data. Software implementing these methods has been included in the widely used TM4 microarray analysis package.","['Djebbari, Amira', 'Quackenbush, John']","['Djebbari A', 'Quackenbush J']","['Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Biostatistics, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA. amirad@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080704,England,BMC Syst Biol,BMC systems biology,101301827,,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2008/07/08 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/07/08 09:00'],"['2007/12/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/08 09:00 [entrez]']","['1752-0509-2-57 [pii]', '10.1186/1752-0509-2-57 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Syst Biol. 2008 Jul 4;2:57. doi: 10.1186/1752-0509-2-57.,,,PMC2474592,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although, imatinib-resistant cells showed decreased levels of both ENT1 and ENT2 activity and expression, these cells remained sensitive to gemcitabine, suggesting that nucleoside analogs can be used as adjunctive therapy.","['Leisewitz, Andrea V', 'Zimmerman, Eric I', 'Jones, Shannon Z', 'Yang, Jing', 'Graves, Lee M']","['Leisewitz AV', 'Zimmerman EI', 'Jones SZ', 'Yang J', 'Graves LM']","['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids,"Nucleosides, nucleotides & nucleic acids",100892832,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1)', '0 (Nucleoside Transport Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (SLC29A1 protein, mouse)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Deoxycytidine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transport Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporter 1', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Mice', 'Nucleoside Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/05 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['794701353 [pii]', '10.1080/15257770802145892 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleosides Nucleotides Nucleic Acids. 2008 Jun;27(6):779-86. doi: 10.1080/15257770802145892.,,"['R01 GM069976/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976-01A1/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976-02/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976-04/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM069976-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2702138,['NIHMS120586'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, their association with established prognostic markers is unknown. In this study, we analyzed the expression of Bcl-2, Bax, and Mcl-1 in 185 CLL patients and evaluated their relationship with other prognostic markers, in vitro sensitivity to fludarabine, and clinical outcome. Mcl-1 expression was significantly correlated with stage of disease (P < .001), lymphocyte doubling time (P = .01), V(H) gene mutation status (P < .001), CD38 expression (P < .001), and ZAP-70 expression (P = .003). In addition, Mcl-1 and Mcl-1/Bax ratios showed strong correlations with in vitro resistance to fludarabine (P = .005 and P < .001, respectively). Furthermore, elevated Mcl-1 expression and Mcl-1/Bax ratios were predictive of time to first treatment in the whole cohort (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively) and in stage A patients only (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively). Taken together, our data show that Mcl-1 is a key controller of in vitro drug resistance and is an important regulator of disease progression and outcome in CLL. It therefore represents a promising therapeutic target in this incurable condition. The close correlation between Mcl-1 expression and V(H) gene mutation status, CD38 expression, and ZAP-70 expression offers a biologic explanation for their association with adverse prognosis.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Lin, Thet Thet', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Hewamana, Saman', 'Brennan, Paul', 'Hiller, Louise', 'Hills, Robert', 'Ward, Rachel', 'Starczynski, Jane', 'Austen, Belinda', 'Hooper, Laura', 'Stankovic, Tatjana', 'Fegan, Chris']","['Pepper C', 'Lin TT', 'Pratt G', 'Hewamana S', 'Brennan P', 'Hiller L', 'Hills R', 'Ward R', 'Starczynski J', 'Austen B', 'Hooper L', 'Stankovic T', 'Fegan C']","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom. peppercj@cf.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080703,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/blood', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/blood', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*blood/genetics', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/blood']",2008/07/05 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51941-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-157131 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 1;112(9):3807-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-05-157131.

We demonstrate that a combination of ABT-737 and TRAIL induced significant cell death in multiple cancer types, including renal, prostate, and lung cancers, although each agent individually had little activity in these tumor cells. All of these cell lines expressed the Mcl-1 protein that is known to block the activity of ABT-737 and TRAIL but did not block the synergy between these agents. However, Bax-deficient cell lines, including DU145 and HCT116 cells and those cell lines expressing low levels of TRAIL receptor, were resistant to apoptosis induced by these agents. To understand how ABT-737 functions to markedly increase TRAIL sensitivity, the levels of specific death-inducing signaling complex components were evaluated. Treatment with ABT-737 did not change the levels of c-FLIP, FADD, and caspase-8 but up-regulated the levels of the TRAIL receptor DR5. DR5 up-regulation induced by ABT-737 treatment occurred through a transcriptional mechanism, and mutagenesis studies demonstrated that the NF-kappaB site found in the DR5 promoter was essential for the ability of ABT-737 to increase the levels of this mRNA. Using luciferase reporter plasmids, ABT-737 was shown to stimulate NF-kappaB activity. Together, these results demonstrate that the ability of ABT-737 and TRAIL to induce apoptosis is mediated through activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Combinations of ABT-737 and TRAIL can be exploited therapeutically where antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members drive tumor cell resistance to current anticancer therapies.","['Song, Jin H', 'Kandasamy, Karthikeyan', 'Kraft, Andrew S']","['Song JH', 'Kandasamy K', 'Kraft AS']","['Hollings Cancer Center, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080703,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (ABT-737)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein)', '0 (CFLAR protein, human)', '0 (FADD protein, human)', '0 (Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nitrophenols)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 8/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Fas-Associated Death Domain Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutagenesis', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Nitrophenols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Response Elements/genetics', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/genetics']",2008/07/05 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49244-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M802511200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Sep 5;283(36):25003-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802511200.

HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) is a protein encoded by HTLV-1 that contains a bZIP domain and functions to repress HTLV-1 transcription. HBZ has been shown to repress viral transcription by dimerizing with CREB, which occurs specifically through the bZIP domain in each protein, and preventing CREB from binding to the DNA. However, we previously found that HBZ causes only partial removal of CREB from a chromosomally integrated viral promoter, and more importantly, an HBZ mutant lacking the COOH-terminal bZIP domain retains the ability to repress viral transcription. These results suggest that an additional mechanism contributes to HBZ-mediated repression of HTLV-1 transcription. In this study, we show that HBZ binds directly to the p300 and CBP coactivators. Two LXXLL-like motifs located within the NH(2)-terminal region of HBZ are important for this interaction and specifically mediate binding to the KIX domain of p300/CBP. We provide evidence that this interaction interferes with the ability of Tax to bind p300/CBP and thereby inhibits the association of the coactivators with the viral promoter. Our findings demonstrate that HBZ utilizes a bipartite mechanism to repress viral transcription.","['Clerc, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas', 'Andre-Arpin, Charlotte', 'Cook, Pamela', 'Barbeau, Benoit', 'Mesnard, Jean-Michel', 'Lemasson, Isabelle']","['Clerc I', 'Polakowski N', 'Andre-Arpin C', 'Cook P', 'Barbeau B', 'Mesnard JM', 'Lemasson I']","[""Universite Montpellier 1 and CNRS, UM5236, Centre d'Etudes d'Agents Pathogenes et Biotechnologies pour la Sante (CPBS), Montpellier, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (p300-CBP Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/physiology', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Dimerization', 'Down-Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', 'Retroviridae Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virus Activation/physiology', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/07/05 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49303-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M803116200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 29;283(35):23903-13. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M803116200.

Many factors could influence the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells for patients of Auto-PBSCT. In this study, we investigated the variables influencing the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells in 240 patients with hematological malignancies who had undergone Auto-PBSCT between 2001 and March 2007 in our center, retrospectively. Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia had the most collected mononuclear cells (MNCs) and patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia had the most collected CD34(+) cells than did other patients. However, patients with multiple myeloma had the least collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells. Patients mobilized with chemotherapy with granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) plus recombinant human interleukin-11(rhIL-11) had the most collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells. The difference is statistical signification between chemotherapy with G-CSF and chemotherapy with G-CSF plus rhIL-11 for collected MNCs (P<0.05). Adults had the most collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells and the difference is statistical signification between children/adolescent and older, children/adolescent and adult for CD34(+) cells (P<0.05). Male patients had the more collected MNCs and CD34(+) cells and the difference is statistical signification for CD34(+) cells (P<0.05). The adverse events were not serious during mobilization. In conclusion, many factors could influence the mobilization of peripheral blood stem cells, and our findings emphasize the need to optimize harvesting technique to enhance safety and minimize morbidity and costs of this valuable procedure.","['Zhang, Cheng', 'Chen, Xinghua', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Gao, Lei', 'Kong, Peiyan', 'Wang, Qingyu', 'Peng, Xiangui', 'Liu, Hong']","['Zhang C', 'Chen X', 'Zhang X', 'Gao L', 'Kong P', 'Wang Q', 'Peng X', 'Liu H']","[""Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Third Military Medical University Chongqing, People's Republic of China. chzhang2003@tom.com""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,England,Transfus Apher Sci,Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,101095653,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/economics/mortality/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/economics/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2008/07/05 09:00,2009/07/25 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1473-0502(08)00080-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transci.2008.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Transfus Apher Sci. 2008 Aug;39(1):21-8. doi: 10.1016/j.transci.2008.05.011.

Akt/protein kinase B, when phosphorylated to its active form, promotes cell survival and blocks apoptosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of Akt pathway in acquired TRAIL resistance of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MB-IT and NALM-24 cells that developed resistance to TRAIL, i.e., TRAIL-resistant cells (MB-IT R and NALM-24 R) were established from TRAIL-sensitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines (MB-IT S and NALM-24 S), respectively, through application of TRAIL and repetitive limiting dilution. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry using propidium iodide/Annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate staining. TRAIL receptor cell surface expression of MB-IT and NALM-24 were analyzed by flow cytometry. Protein levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The obtained resistant cell lines presented the same pattern of receptor expression as sensitive parent cells, and the internalization of DR5 after TRAIL treatment was similar. Caspase-8/3, FLIP, BID, XIAP were cleaved/downregulated in sensitive cells after treatment with TRAIL, but not in the resistant cells. We also observed that phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway was constitutively active in resistant clones, and was not downregulated upon TRAIL treatment. Phosphate and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) level was the same in both sensitive cells and resistant cells, but was quickly downregulated in sensitive cells after TRAIL treatment. Also, resistant cells expressed a high level of phosphorylated inactive form of PTEN than the sensitive cells. Expression levels of PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase were slightly higher in sensitive than resistant cells. When resistant cells were treated with LY 294002 (a PI3K inhibitor), the expression level of phosphorylated Akt was distinctly downregulated, and there was induction of apoptosis when these cells were treated with a combination of TRAIL and LY 294002. When MB-IT-sensitive cells were treated with okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, TRAIL-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that cellular resistance to TRAIL could be developed through phosphorylation (activation) of Akt and phosphorylation (inactivation) of PTEN.","['Dida, Francis', 'Li, Yufeng', 'Iwao, Atsushi', 'Deguchi, Takao', 'Azuma, Eiichi', 'Komada, Yoshihiro']","['Dida F', 'Li Y', 'Iwao A', 'Deguchi T', 'Azuma E', 'Komada Y']","['Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Science, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, Tsu, Mie, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNFSF10 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/*metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/genetics/*physiology']",2008/07/05 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/11/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00182-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1343-53. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.011.

Importantly, a significant subset of patients presents with low grade CLL, but will nevertheless develop a more aggressive and life-threatening disease. As these patients may potentially benefit from early treatment, it is crucial to assess patients' prognosis at diagnosis, allowing individual risk-adapted therapy. Reliable predictions of prognosis in an early stage of the disease have long been lacking in the clinical workup of CLL patients. During the last decades many efforts have been made to identify prognostic markers in CLL, resulting in a plethora of reports describing the predictive value of different parameters with regard to overall survival, disease progression and response to therapy. In this review, we attempt to provide an overview of the literature and we discuss the most important prognostic markers in CLL, from clinical staging systems and serum markers over proliferation markers and cytogenetics to more recent markers like the IgV(H) mutation status and its possible surrogate markers. Particular attention is paid to the advantages and drawbacks of all different markers, both from a clinical and from a technical point-of-view, highlighting the accomplishments as well as the remaining challenges in this rapidly evolving area of CLL research. Although the great majority of prognostic markers is not included in current international treatment guidelines, several of these markers deserve to be evaluated in prospective clinical trials and may eventually contribute to an improved clinical management of CLL patients.","['Van Bockstaele, Femke', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Van Bockstaele F', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080702,England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Mutation', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/genetics']",2008/07/05 09:00,2009/03/11 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/03/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0268-960X(08)00051-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.blre.2008.05.003 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2009 Jan;23(1):25-47. doi: 10.1016/j.blre.2008.05.003.

In this study, we investigated the effect of the saturated fatty acids (SFA) palmitate, stearate, myristate and laurate, and the unsaturated fatty acid linoleate, on the production of proinflammatory cytokines in phorbol ester-differentiated THP-1 cells, a model of human macrophages. Palmitate induced secretion and mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and IL-1 beta, and enhanced lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1 beta secretion. Proinflammatory cytokine secretion was also induced by stearate, but not by the shorter chain SFA, myristate and laurate, or linoleate. Triacsin C abolished the palmitate-induced cytokine secretion, suggesting that palmitate activation to palmitoyl-CoA is required for its effect. Palmitate-induced cytokine secretion was decreased by knockdown of serine palmitoyltransferase and mimicked by C(2)-ceramide, indicating that ceramide is involved in palmitate-induced cytokine secretion. Palmitate phosphorylated p38 and JNK kinases, and blocking of these kinases with specific inhibitors diminished the palmitate-induced cytokine secretion. Palmitate also activated the AP-1 (c-Jun) transcription factor. Knockdown of MyD88 reduced the palmitate-induced IL-8, but not TNF-alpha or IL-1 beta secretion. In conclusion, our data suggest that the long-chain SFA induce proinflammatory cytokines in human macrophages via pathways involving de novo ceramide synthesis. This might contribute to the activation of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques, especially in type 2 diabetes.","['Haversen, Liliana', 'Danielsson, Kristina Noren', 'Fogelstrand, Linda', 'Wiklund, Olov']","['Haversen L', 'Danielsson KN', 'Fogelstrand L', 'Wiklund O']","['Wallenberg Laboratory for Cardiovascular Research, Sahlgrenska Academy, Goteborg University, Bruna Straket 16, 41345 Goteborg, Sweden. liliana.haversen@wlab.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080528,Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Lauric Acids)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Stearic Acids)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0I3V7S25AW (Myristic Acid)', '1160N9NU9U (lauric acid)', '1763-10-6 (Palmitoyl Coenzyme A)', '2V16EO95H1 (Palmitic Acid)', '4ELV7Z65AP (stearic acid)', '9KJL21T0QJ (Linoleic Acid)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Ceramides/biosynthesis', 'Cytokines/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/genetics/metabolism', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/metabolism', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Lauric Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia', 'Linoleic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Monocytes/cytology/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics/metabolism', 'Myristic Acid/pharmacology', 'Palmitic Acid/pharmacology', 'Palmitoyl Coenzyme A/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Stearic Acids/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2008/07/05 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2008/07/05 09:00'],"['2007/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/05 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9150(08)00341-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.05.033 [doi]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 2009 Feb;202(2):382-93. doi: 10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2008.05.033.

LEDGF is required for both MLL-dependent transcription and leukemic transformation. Conversely, a subset of menin mutations in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients abrogate interaction with LEDGF while preserving MLL interaction but nevertheless compromise MLL/menin-dependent functions.

There is striking evidence that immunological Graft-versus-Leukemia (GvL)-reactions efficiently eradicate malignant cells after transplant. After HLA-matched HCT both the beneficial GvL-effect and the detrimental Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD) are mediated by donor derived T-cells specific for minor histocompatibility antigens (mHag) that differ between patient and stem cell donor. In addition, tumor-specific antigens can also be targeted and contribute to GvL-reactivity. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art knowledge on mHag and presents the potential therapeutical options on example of the mHag HA-1. HA-1 is currently the best characterized mHag and particularly attractive for immunotherapy due to the restricted expression on hematopoietic cells and on some solid tumors but not on cells involved during GvHD. This would allow amplifying the endogenous GvL-effect and selectively targeting malignant HA-1-positive cells without causing GvHD. HA-1-specific immunotherapy in eligible patient and donor pairs may range from vaccination with the immunogenic HA-1 peptide to the infusion of HA-1-specific cytotoxic T-cells (adoptive immunotherapy).","['Hudecek, M', 'Bartsch, K', 'Tschiedel, S', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Hudecek M', 'Bartsch K', 'Tschiedel S', 'Niederwieser D']","['Universtitatsklinikum Leipzig, Department Hamatologie, Onkologie und Gerinnung, Leipzig, Germany. m.hudecek@gmx.de']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (HA-1 antigen)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Oligopeptides)']",IM,"['Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*physiology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Oligopeptides/immunology/therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/07/17 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2008-1081100 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2008 Jul;133(28-29):1511-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2008-1081100.,36,,,,Kleine Antigene - grosse Wirkung.

Cell growth inhibitory rate could reach 95% after exposure with more than 100 microg/ml SSCC for 72 h. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that treatment of K562 cells with SSCC resulted in the accumulation of cells in the G(2)/M phase. The growth inhibition of K562 cells after treatment with SSCC was subsequently associated with the induction of apoptosis, as evidenced by (1) the typical apoptotic morphologic changes measured by a fluorescence microscope, (2) the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation into a ladder determined by agarose gel electrophoresis and (3) the occurrence of sub-G(0)/G(1) phase cells analyzed by flow cytometry.

The transcriptional regulator LRF (Leukemia/lymphoma Related Factor) has been shown to prevent p19ARF transcription and consequently to inhibit senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Here we report, for the first time, that LRF is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-20a. Using a gene reporter assay, direct interaction of miR-20a with the LRF 3'UTR is demonstrated. To validate the interaction miR-20a/3'UTR LRF miR-20a was over-expressed, either by transient transfection or retroviral infection, in wild type mouse embryo fibroblasts and in LRF-null MEF derived from LRF knock-out mice. We observed LRF decrease, p19ARF increase, inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of senescence. The comparison of miR-20a activity in wt and LRF-null MEF indicates that LRF is the main mediator of the miR-20a-induced senescence and that other targets are cooperating. As LRF down-regulation/p19ARF induction is always accompanied by E2F1 down-regulation and increase of p16, we propose that all these events act in synergy to accomplish miR-20a-induced senescence in MEF. Senescence has been recently revaluated as a tumor suppressor mechanism, alternative to apoptosis; from this point of view the discovery of new physiological ""senescence inducer"" appears to be promising as this molecule could be used as anticancer drug.","['Poliseno, Laura', 'Pitto, Letizia', 'Simili, Marcella', 'Mariani, Laura', 'Riccardi, Luisa', 'Ciucci, Alessia', 'Rizzo, Milena', 'Evangelista, Monica', 'Mercatanti, Alberto', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Rainaldi, Giuseppe']","['Poliseno L', 'Pitto L', 'Simili M', 'Mariani L', 'Riccardi L', 'Ciucci A', 'Rizzo M', 'Evangelista M', 'Mercatanti A', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Rainaldi G']","['Laboratory of Gene and Molecular Therapy, Institute of Clinical Physiology, CNR, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2f1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn20 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb7a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cellular Senescence/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA Interference', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002542 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jul 2;3(7):e2542. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002542.,,['R01 CA102142/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2435600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most cases, NF-kappaB activation is found in malignant cells and results from activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway, leading to RelA and/or c-Rel activation. Recently, NF-kappaB activity in inflammatory cells infiltrating solid tumors has been shown to contribute to solid tumor initiation and progression. Noncanonical NF-kappaB activation, which leads to RelB activation, has also been reported in breast carcinoma, prostate cancer, and lymphoid leukemia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we report a novel role for RelB in stromal cells that promote T-cell leukemogenesis. RelB deficiency delayed leukemia onset in the TEL-JAK2 transgenic mouse model of human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow chimeric mouse experiments showed that RelB is not required in the hematopoietic compartment. In contrast, RelB plays a role in radio-resistant stromal cells to accelerate leukemia onset and increase disease severity. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The present results are the first to uncover a role for RelB in the crosstalk between non-hematopoietic stromal cells and leukemic cells. Thus, besides its previously reported role intrinsic to specific cancer cells, the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway may also play a pro-oncogenic role in cancer microenvironmental cells.","['dos Santos, Nuno R', 'Williame, Maryvonne', 'Gachet, Stephanie', 'Cormier, Francoise', 'Janin, Anne', 'Weih, Debra', 'Weih, Falk', 'Ghysdael, Jacques']","['dos Santos NR', 'Williame M', 'Gachet S', 'Cormier F', 'Janin A', 'Weih D', 'Weih F', 'Ghysdael J']","['Institut Curie, Centre de Recherche, Orsay, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '147257-52-1 (Nfkb1 protein, mouse)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/genetics', 'Stromal Cells/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002555 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jul 2;3(7):e2555. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002555.,,,PMC2440518,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although some patients can be cured by current therapies, novel agents are needed to further improve outcomes. We hypothesized that Src tyrosine kinase inhibition by dasatinib may have antilymphoma effects. Here, we demonstrate that dasatinib inhibits cell growth through G(1)-S blockage in five of seven DLBCL cell lines at clinically achievable concentrations. Compared to resting B cells, DLBCL has increased tyrosine phosphorylation activities. As expected, dasatinib inhibits phosphorylation of several Src family kinase members. However, this inhibition occurs in all cell lines regardless of their proliferative response to the drug. In contrast, the activity of two downstream signaling molecules, Syk and phospholipase Cgamma2 (PLCgamma2), are well correlated with cell line sensitivity to dasatinib, suggesting that these molecules are crucial in mediating the proliferation of activated lymphoma cells.

FLC ratio was calculated as kappa/lambda (reference range 0.26-1.65). On the basis of the distribution of values, a cutpoint kappa/lambda FLC ratio of <0.03 or >32 was chosen for further analysis. Overall survival was significantly inferior in patients with an abnormal FLC ratio of <0.03 or >32 (n=479) compared with those with an FLC ratio between 0.03 and 32 (n=311), with median survival of 30 versus 39 months, respectively. We incorporated abnormal FLC ratio with the International Staging System (ISS) risk factors (that is, albumin <3.5 g/dl and serum beta(2)-microglobulin >or=3.5 g/l), to create a risk stratification model with improved prognostic capabilities. Patients with 0, 1, 2 or 3 adverse risk factors had significantly different overall survival, with median survival times of 51, 39, 30 and 22 months, respectively (P<0.001).

Lenalidomide and bortezomib have shown promising response rates in relapsed and newly diagnosed MM, and bortezomib has recently been reported to inhibit OCLs. We here investigated the effect of lenalidomide on OCL formation and osteoclastogenesis in comparison with bortezomib. Both drugs decreased alpha V beta 3-integrin, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive cells and bone resorption on dentin disks. In addition, both agents decreased receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) secretion of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) derived from MM patients. We identified PU.1 and pERK as major targets of lenalidomide, and nuclear factor of activated T cells of bortezomib, resulting in inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, downregulation of cathepsin K, essential for resorption of the bone collagen matrix, was observed. We demonstrated a significant decrease of growth and survival factors including macrophage inflammatory protein-alpha, B-cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand. Importantly, in serum from MM patients treated with lenalidomide, the essential bone-remodeling factor RANKL, as well as the RANKL/OPG ratio, were significantly reduced, whereas osteoprotegerin (OPG) was increased. We conclude that both agents specifically target key factors in osteoclastogenesis, and could directly affect the MM-OCL-BMSCs activation loop in osteolytic bone disease.","['Breitkreutz, I', 'Raab, M S', 'Vallet, S', 'Hideshima, T', 'Raje, N', 'Mitsiades, C', 'Chauhan, D', 'Okawa, Y', 'Munshi, N C', 'Richardson, P G', 'Anderson, K C']","['Breitkreutz I', 'Raab MS', 'Vallet S', 'Hideshima T', 'Raje N', 'Mitsiades C', 'Chauhan D', 'Okawa Y', 'Munshi NC', 'Richardson PG', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.

GX15-070/Obatoclax is a small-molecule BH3 mimetic compound that has shown activity against several hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. In the present work, we report that GX15-070 led to the disruption of BCL-2/BIM and MCL-1/BAK complexes in CLL cells, followed by the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. CLL cells showed lower sensitivity to GX15-070 than primary mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) ones, in correlation with higher levels of phosphorylated BCL-2 at serine 70 residue (pBCL-2(Ser70)) in CLL cells. Decrease in BCL-2 phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 inhibition increased CLL sensitivity to GX15-070, while blocking BCL-2 dephosphorylation using a PP2A antagonist reduced the activity of this BH3 mimetic. GX15-070 activity was increased by cotreatment with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. However, as proteasome inhibition led to the accumulation of phosphorylated BCL-2, the degree of interaction between GX15-070 and bortezomib was regulated by basal pBCL-2(Ser70) levels. These results support the role of BCL-2 phosphorylation as a mechanism of resistance to BH3 mimetic compounds, and demonstrate that combination approaches including ERK inhibitors could enhance BH3 mimetics activity both alone or in combination with proteasome inhibitors.","['Perez-Galan, P', 'Roue, G', 'Lopez-Guerra, M', 'Nguyen, M', 'Villamor, N', 'Montserrat, E', 'Shore, G C', 'Campo, E', 'Colomer, D']","['Perez-Galan P', 'Roue G', 'Lopez-Guerra M', 'Nguyen M', 'Villamor N', 'Montserrat E', 'Shore GC', 'Campo E', 'Colomer D']","[""Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Unit, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080703,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'QN4128B52A (obatoclax)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrroles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008175 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.175 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1712-20. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.175.

Myelosuppressive therapy, preferentially with hydroxyurea, can reduce the rate of vascular complications, but there is some concern about an increased rate of leukemic transformation with this agent. Therefore, management of these disorders poses a significant challenge, and a risk-oriented therapeutic approach should be strictly followed to avoid inappropriate exposure to cytotoxic drugs on one side or suboptimal treatment on the other. Established risk factors for cardiovascular events are represented by older age and previous thrombosis, whereas impact of novel biological factors, including leukocytosis and JAK2V617F mutational status and/or mutational burden, is under active investigation. Low-risk PV patients should be managed only with phlebotomy and aspirin, whereas high-risk patients should also receive cytotoxic therapy. Regarding the management of ET, there is no clear indication for intervention in low-risk patients, whereas high-risk patients should be managed with chemotherapy. Other therapeutic options, such as interferon-alpha or anagrelide, may find place in selected patients including those who are resistant/intolerant to hydroxyurea.

METHODS: During the period of 1981 to 1998, records of children with ALL were retrospectively reviewed with respect to clinical presentation, laboratory findings, risk factors, stratification, therapy and outcome. The protocols used in treatment included 4 local protocols (KFSH 81, 84, 87 and 90), and subsequently, Children's Cancer Group (CCG) protocols, and these were grouped as Era 1 (1981-1992) and Era 2 (1993-1998). RESULTS: Of 509 children with ALL treated during this period, 316 were treated using local protocols and 193 using CCG protocols. Drugs used in Era 1 included a 4-drug induction using etoposid (VP-16) instead of L-asparaginase. Consolidation was based on high dose methotrexate (MTX) 1 g/m(2) and maintenance was based on oral mercaptopurine (6-MP) and MTX with periodic pulses using intravenous teniposide (VM-26), Ara-C, L-asparaginase, adriamycin, prednisone, VP-16 and cyclophosphamide. International protocols were introduced in Era 2, which was also marked by intensification of early treatment, a wider selection of cytoreductive agents, and the alternating use of non-cross-resistant pairs of drugs during the post-remission period. The end-of-induction remission rate improved from 90% in Era 1 to 95% in Era 2, which was of borderline statistical significance (P=.049). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) improved from 30.6% in Era 1 to 64.2% in Era 2 (P<.001). Improvement in outcome was achieved without any significant increase in morbidity or mortality, due to improvement in both systemic therapy and supportive care. The most important independent prognostic factors were intensity of therapy, poor risk category assignment and CNS disease at diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Outcome in children with ALL has improved because of intensification of treatment protocols and better supportive care.","['Al-Nasser, Abdallah', 'El-Solh, Hassan', 'De Vol, Edward', 'El-Hassan, Ibrahim', 'Alzahrani, Ali', 'Al-Sudairy, Reem', 'Al-Mahr, Mohammed', 'Al-Musa, Abdulrahman', 'Al-Jefri, Abdulla', 'Saleh, Mahasen', 'Rifai, Samira', 'Belgaumi, Asim', 'Osman, Layla', 'Ashraf, Khairy', 'Salim, Mohammed', 'Silo, Ameurfina', 'Roberts, George']","['Al-Nasser A', 'El-Solh H', 'De Vol E', 'El-Hassan I', 'Alzahrani A', 'Al-Sudairy R', 'Al-Mahr M', 'Al-Musa A', 'Al-Jefri A', 'Saleh M', 'Rifai S', 'Belgaumi A', 'Osman L', 'Ashraf K', 'Salim M', 'Silo A', 'Roberts G']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. alnasser@kfshrc.edu.sa']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Saudi Arabia,Ann Saudi Med,Annals of Saudi medicine,8507355,,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/04 09:00,2009/01/09 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['07-325 [pii]', '10.5144/0256-4947.2008.251 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Saudi Med. 2008 Jul-Aug;28(4):251-9. doi: 10.5144/0256-4947.2008.251.,,,PMC6074343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median sCD22 level measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was 18 ng/mL for 93 patients with HCL. sCD22 levels varied from 2.1 to 163 ng/mL and were higher (P < .001) than 23 normal donors (median, 0.6 ng/mL). More than 95% of normal donors had sCD22 levels less than 1.9 ng/mL. sCD22 levels were proportional to concentrations of circulating HCL cells (P = .002), and HCL spleen size (P < .001). sCD22 levels normalized with complete but not partial response to treatment. sCD22 levels up to 300 ng/mL had less than a 2-fold effect on the cytotoxicity of the anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22. sCD22 levels may be useful to follow in patients with HCL and may be more specific than sCD25 in patients with CD22(+)/CD25(-) disease.

Early cellular changes after HTLV-1 infection have been difficult to study due to the poorly infectious nature of HTLV-1 and the need for cell-to-cell contact for HTLV-1 transmission. Using a series of reporter systems, we show that HeLa cells cease proliferation within one or two division cycles after infection by HTLV-1 or transduction of the HTLV-1 tax gene. HTLV-1-infected HeLa cells, like their tax-transduced counterparts, expressed high levels of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1), developed mitotic abnormalities, and became arrested in G(1) in senescence. In contrast, cells of a human osteosarcoma lineage (HOS) continued to divide after HTLV-1 infection or Tax expression, albeit at a reduced growth rate and with mitotic aberrations. Unique to HOS cells is the dramatic reduction of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) expression, which is in part associated with the constitutive activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. The loss of p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) in HOS cells apparently allows HTLV-1- and Tax-induced G(1) arrest to be bypassed. Finally, HTLV-1 infection and Tax expression also cause human SupT1 T cells to arrest in the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. These results suggest that productive HTLV-1 infection ordinarily leads to Tax-mediated G(1) arrest. However, T cells containing somatic mutations that inactivate p21(CIP1/WAF1) and p27(KIP1) may continue to proliferate after HTLV-1 infection and Tax expression. These infected cells can expand clonally, accumulate additional chromosomal abnormalities, and progress to cancer.","['Liu, Meihong', 'Yang, Liangpeng', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Liu, Baoying', 'Merling, Randall', 'Xia, Zheng', 'Giam, Chou-Zen']","['Liu M', 'Yang L', 'Zhang L', 'Liu B', 'Merling R', 'Xia Z', 'Giam CZ']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Bethesda, MD 20814, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080702,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'G1 Phase/*physiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00091-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00091-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Sep;82(17):8442-55. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00091-08.

Although many substrates for MMP-9, including components of the extracellular matrix, soluble mediators such as chemokines, and cell surface molecules have been identified, we undertook a more comprehensive proteomics-based approach to identify new substrates to further understand how MMP-9 might contribute to tumor metastasis. Previous proteomics approaches to identify protease substrates have depended upon differential labeling of each sample. Instead we used a label-free quantitative proteomics approach based on ultraperformance LC-ESI-high/low collision energy MS. Conditioned medium from a human metastatic prostate cancer cell line, PC-3ML, in which MMP-9 had been down-regulated by RNA interference was compared with that from the parental cells. From more than 200 proteins identified, 69 showed significant alteration in levels after depletion of the protease (>+/-2-fold), suggesting that they might be candidate substrates. Levels of six of these (amyloid-beta precursor protein, collagen VI, leukemia inhibitory factor, neuropilin-1, prostate cancer cell-derived growth factor (PCDGF), and protease nexin-1 (PN-1)) were tested in the conditioned media by immunoblotting. There was a strong correlation between results by ultraperformance LC-ESI-high/low collision energy MS and by immunoblotting giving credence to the label-free approach. Further information about MMP-9 cleavage was obtained by comparison of the peptide coverage of collagen VI in the presence and absence of MMP-9 showing increased sensitivity of the C- and N-terminal globular regions over the helical regions. Susceptibility of PN-1 and leukemia inhibitory factor to MMP-9 degradation was confirmed by in vitro incubation of the recombinant proteins with recombinant MMP-9. The MMP-9 cleavage sites in PN-1 were sequenced. This study provides a new label-free method for degradomics cell-based screening leading to the identification of a series of proteins whose levels are affected by MMP-9, some of which are clearly direct substrates for MMP-9 and become candidates for involvement in metastasis.","['Xu, Danmei', 'Suenaga, Naoko', 'Edelmann, Mariola J', 'Fridman, Rafael', 'Muschel, Ruth J', 'Kessler, Benedikt M']","['Xu D', 'Suenaga N', 'Edelmann MJ', 'Fridman R', 'Muschel RJ', 'Kessler BM']","['Radiation Oncology and Biology, Medical Science Division, Churchill Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 7LJ, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080702,United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,"['0 (APP protein, human)', '0 (Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protease Nexins)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (SERPINE2 protein, human)', '0 (Serpin E2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Culture Media, Conditioned', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protease Nexins', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA Interference', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/metabolism', 'Serpin E2', 'Substrate Specificity']",2008/07/04 09:00,2009/01/29 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1535-9476(20)30887-2 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M800095-MCP200 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2008 Nov;7(11):2215-28. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M800095-MCP200.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to evaluate activity of the Radiotherapy Department by measuring quality of delivered therapy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between November 1999 and November 2005, 305 patients, including 172 boys and 133 girls from 2 to 18-years-old, underwent irradiation in the Radiotherapy Department, University Children's Hospital of Cracow.162 patients were treated because of proliferative diseases of the hematopoietic system--96 children were diagnosed with leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 66 children suffered from Hodgkin's disease. 67 children had CNS tumors, 35 had soft tissue or bone sarcomas, 20--neuroblastoma, 12--Wilm's tumor, and 9 were diagnosed with other malignancies. RESULTS: 293 children (96%) received radical treatment, and 12 paediatric patients (4%) underwent palliative irradiation. During these 6 years, a systematic increase in the share of conformal techniques in all therapeutic methods used in the Radiotherapy Department was observed. Currently, the conformal techniques are used for every patient treated radically. Severe post-radiation reaction (G3, G4) was observed in 3 children, who were receiving chemotherapy with radio-sensitizers at the same time. 2 children ""suffered radiological pneumonitis"". CONCLUSIONS: Oncological treatment for children provided in the one centre is a good option for paediatric patients. There is no possibility to treat children with TBI because of lack of second linear accelerator.","['Korab Chrzanowska, Elzbieta', 'Bartoszewska, Joanna']","['Korab Chrzanowska E', 'Bartoszewska J']","['Pracownia Radioterapii, Uniwersytecki Szpital Dzieciecy w Krakowie. ekorchrz@mp.pl']",['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Delivery of Health Care', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*radiotherapy', 'Poland', 'Quality of Health Care', '*Radiation Injuries', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/04 09:00,2008/08/01 09:00,['2008/07/04 09:00'],"['2008/07/04 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/04 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2007;64(12):1010-3.,,,,,Radioterapia pediatryczna--jako jedna z trzech podstawowych metod leczenia onkologicznego u dzieci.

The disease relapsed 7 months later with cytogenetic change of t(8;9)(p22;p24). Flow cytometry analysis showed evolutional change of immunophenotype from negative to positive HLA-DR expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis demonstrated a PCM1-JAK2 fusion gene. We speculate that the cytogenetic change of t(8;9)(p22;p24) may induce HLA-DR immunophenotypic switch and a coordination of the two evolutional changes may play a role in leukemic cell progression.","['Huang, Kuan-Po', 'Chase, Andrew J', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Reiter, Andrea', 'Li, Tzu-Ying', 'Wang, Tso-Fu', 'Chu, Sung-Chao', 'Lu, Xuan-Yin', 'Li, Chi-Cheng', 'Kao, Ruey-Ho']","['Huang KP', 'Chase AJ', 'Cross NCP', 'Reiter A', 'Li TY', 'Wang TF', 'Chu SC', 'Lu XY', 'Li CC', 'Kao RH']","['Division of Oncology and Hematology, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital, 707, Sec.3, Chung-Yang Rd., Hualien, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury District Hospital, Salisbury, UK.', 'III.

Runx1-deficient mice die around embryonic day (E)12.5 due to severe hemorrhage in the central nervous system and the complete absence of definitive hematopoietic cells. Since mice lacking the heterodimeric partner of Runx1, PEBP2beta/CBFbeta, are almost identical in phenotype to Runx1 (-/-) mice, PEBP2beta was believed to be essential for the in vivo function of Runx1. Here we show that transgenic overexpression of Runx1 partially rescues the lethal phenotype of PEBP2beta-deficient mice at E12.5. Some of the rescued mice escaped from the severe hemorrhage at E11.5-12.5, although definitive hematopoiesis was not restored. Thus, PEBP2beta-independent Runx1 activation can occur in vivo. This observation sheds new light on the mechanism(s) that regulate the activity of Runx transcription factors.","['Yokomizo, Tomomasa', 'Yanagida, Masatoshi', 'Huang, Gang', 'Osato, Motomi', 'Honda, Chikako', 'Ema, Masatsugu', 'Takahashi, Satoru', 'Yamamoto, Masayuki', 'Ito, Yoshiaki']","['Yokomizo T', 'Yanagida M', 'Huang G', 'Osato M', 'Honda C', 'Ema M', 'Takahashi S', 'Yamamoto M', 'Ito Y']","['Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.', 'Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Shogoin-Kawaharacho, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore, 138673, Singapore. motomi@imcb.a-star.edu.sg.', 'Oncology Research Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 138673, Singapore. motomi@imcb.a-star.edu.sg.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Institute of Basic Medical Sciences and Center for Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance, University of Tsukuba, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'JST-ERATO Environmental Response Project, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8575, Japan.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, 61 Biopolis Drive, Proteos, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.', 'Oncology Research Institute, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 138673, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080702,Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cerebral Hemorrhage/*genetics/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit/*genetics/*metabolism', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Lethal', 'Genotype', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Phenotype']",2008/07/03 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2007/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/21 00:00 [revised]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0121-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0121-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2008 Sep;88(2):134-138. doi: 10.1007/s12185-008-0121-4.

The proportion 'cured' is defined as the proportion of survivors for whom, as a group, there is no longer excess mortality compared to the general population. Average time to cure is defined as the time since diagnosis at which the excess mortality rate has declined to or below a predetermined small value. Data on children diagnosed with leukaemia during 1971-2000 in Great Britain were used to estimate trends in survival, the proportion cured and the average time to cure. Five-year survival for all types of leukaemia combined rose from 33 to 79% by 2000. The percentage cured rose from 25 to 68% by 1995; it is predicted to increase to 73% for those diagnosed more recently. Average time to cure increased from 12 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 11-14) to 19 years (95% CI: 14-26) for lymphoid leukaemia (average annual increase of 0.3 years; P<0.001), but remained at about 5 years for acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia. The proportion of children cured of leukaemia has risen dramatically, but the period of excess mortality associated with lymphoid leukaemia has also increased, possibly because of late relapse, secondary malignancy and toxicity from treatment.","['Shah, A', 'Stiller, C A', 'Kenward, M G', 'Vincent, T', 'Eden, T O B', 'Coleman, M P']","['Shah A', 'Stiller CA', 'Kenward MG', 'Vincent T', 'Eden TO', 'Coleman MP']","['Non-communicable Disease Epidemiology Unit, Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Keppel Street, London WC1E 7HT, UK. anjali.shah@lshtm.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality/*therapy', '*Registries', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['6604466 [pii]', '10.1038/sj.bjc.6604466 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 2008 Jul 8;99(1):219-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6604466.,,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],PMC2453011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent evidence has implicated signal transduction pathways in leukemic progression and also in resistance to cytotoxic therapy. We have used a short-term, in-vitro incubation assay with cytotoxic analysis by MTT, confirmed by histone-associated DNA fragmentation, to evaluate both classical and nonclassical combinations of drugs. Isobologram median effect analysis, confirmed by curve shift analysis, was used to identify synergy and antagonism. Fluvastatin, a prenylation inhibitor, demonstrates global enhancement of the effects of classical agents in both AML-193 and KG-1 cell lines. Similarly, the m-TOR inhibitors, RAD-001 (everolimus) and rapamycin, also cause time-dependent global enhancement of cytotoxic agents. At clinically achievable combinations, RAD-001 perturbs the AKT pathway in vitro. The unique combination of fluvastatin and an m-TOR inhibitor was synergistic in both cell lines. These effects were independent of whether or not human plasma was used in the assay system. These studies suggest several novel combinations of agents that need to be evaluated in the management of leukemia.","['Calabro, Anthony', 'Tai, Julia', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Budman, Daniel R']","['Calabro A', 'Tai J', 'Allen SL', 'Budman DR']","['Experimental Therapeutics Section, Don Monti Division of Oncology, Monter Cancer Center, Lake Success, NY 11042, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '4L066368AS (Fluvastatin)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Everolimus', 'Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated/*pharmacology', 'Fluvastatin', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Kinases/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Sirolimus/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/CAD.0b013e328304ae19 [doi]', '00001813-200808000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2008 Aug;19(7):705-12. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0b013e328304ae19.,,"['CA 93542-2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-35279/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-88104-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report two additional cases of trisomy 19 as a sole karyotypic aberration in myeloid malignancies. One of these cases involved a 6-month-old male who was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia minimally differentiated. His karyotype was 47,XY,+19[20]. He expired 5 days after diagnosis. Another case occurred in an 80-yr-old female who had refractory anemia with excess blasts. Her karyotype was 47,XX,+19[16]/46,XX[4]. Four months later, her peripheral blood smears suggested that the disease had progressed, but she refused further evaluation. Based on a review of the existing literature and the results of this report, trisomy 19 not only as a secondary abnormality but also as a sole karyotypic aberration is strongly associated with myeloid disorder; however, it is not preferentially found in specific FAB subgroups of myelodysplasic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.","['Jung, Soon Il', 'Cho, Hee Soon', 'Lee, Chae Hoon', 'Kim, Kyong Dong', 'Ha, Jung Ok', 'Kim, Min-Kyoung', 'Lee, Kyung Hee', 'Hyun, Myung Soo']","['Jung SI', 'Cho HS', 'Lee CH', 'Kim KD', 'Ha JO', 'Kim MK', 'Lee KH', 'Hyun MS']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Korea (South),Korean J Lab Med,The Korean journal of laboratory medicine,101322822,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/*diagnosis/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', '*Trisomy']",2008/07/03 09:00,2009/02/25 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['200806174 [pii]', '10.3343/kjlm.2008.28.3.174 [doi]']",ppublish,Korean J Lab Med. 2008 Jun;28(3):174-8. doi: 10.3343/kjlm.2008.28.3.174.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In 44 DMPM specimens obtained from 38 patients, TA was determined using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol and ALT was detected by assaying ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. The prognostic significance of telomere maintenance mechanisms was analyzed by Cox regression in the overall series and in a subset of 29 patients who underwent a uniform treatment regimen consisting of cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic i.p. chemotherapy. RESULTS: Telomere maintenance mechanisms were detectable in 86.4% of DMPM: ALT or TA alone was found in 18.2% or 63.6% of lesions, respectively, whereas two cases (4.6%) were ALT+/TA+. TA and ALT proved to be inversely associated (P = 0.002). In the overall series, TA was prognostic for 4-year relapse (TA+ versus TA-, hazard ratio, 3.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.23-8.86; P = 0.018) and cancer-related death (TA+ versus TA-, hazard ratio, 3.56; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-12.51; P = 0.045), whereas ALT failed to significantly affect clinical outcome.

Nevertheless, a subpopulation of patients does not respond to rituximab. The reason for treatment failure as well as the exact mechanism of action is still uncertain. The function of rituximab has long been associated with the partitioning of CD20 molecules to lipid microdomains. We now show that the extent of CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts correlates with response to rituximab. In addition, expression of the raft-associated sphingolipid GM1 on lymphoma cells is associated with the susceptibility of lymphoma cells to rituximab. Furthermore, we show substantially different GM1 expression in various primary non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Whereas chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells have a low GM1 expression, marginal zone lymphoma cells exhibit much higher levels. Differences were not only detected among various lymphoma subgroups but also within one lymphoma subtype. Interestingly, whereas CLL cells from patients with high GM1 expression responded to rituximab, patients with low GM1 expressing CLL cells did not. These data show the importance of membrane microdomains in the effect of rituximab and may offer a predictive factor for the responsiveness of lymphoma cells to rituximab.","['Meyer zum Buschenfelde, Christian', 'Feuerstacke, Yvonne', 'Gotze, Katharina S', 'Scholze, Katrin', 'Peschel, Christian']","['Meyer zum Buschenfelde C', 'Feuerstacke Y', 'Gotze KS', 'Scholze K', 'Peschel C']","['III Medical Department, Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '85373-04-2 (G(M1)-oligosaccharide)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Membrane Microdomains/drug effects/physiology', 'Oligosaccharides/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Rituximab']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/13/5414 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5601 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 1;68(13):5414-22. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5601.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then, permanent defects in oxygen consumption that could explain the dependence of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis have not been identified. Here, we show that under normoxic conditions exposure of leukemia cells to bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) promotes accumulation of lactate in the culture medium and reduces mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsiM) in both cell types. Notably, the consumption of glucose was not altered in cocultures, suggesting that the accumulation of lactate was the result of reduced pyruvate metabolism. Interestingly, the decrease in DeltaPsiM was mediated by mitochondrial uncoupling in leukemia cells and was accompanied by increased expression of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2). HL60 cells fail to increase UCP2 expression, are not uncoupled after coculture, and do not exhibit increased aerobic glycolysis, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of UCP2 in OCI-AML3 cells reversed mitochondrial uncoupling and aerobic glycolysis elicited by MSC. Taken together, these data suggest that microenvironment activation of highly conserved mammalian UCPs may facilitate the Warburg effect in the absence of permanent respiratory impairment.","['Samudio, Ismael', 'Fiegl, Michael', 'McQueen, Teresa', 'Clise-Dwyer, Karen', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Samudio I', 'Fiegl M', 'McQueen T', 'Clise-Dwyer K', 'Andreeff M']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Ion Channels)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (UCP2 protein, human)', '0 (Uncoupling Agents)', '0 (Uncoupling Protein 2)']",IM,"['Aerobiosis/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Glycolysis/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Uncoupling Agents/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Uncoupling Protein 2']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/13/5198 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0555 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 1;68(13):5198-205. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0555.,,"['P01 CA055164-070010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-069006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-079006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA055164-060010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2562568,['NIHMS57492'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency is known to exacerbate thiopurine toxicity. However, many patients are highly sensitive to thiopurines for unknown reasons. We show that multidrug-resistance protein 4 (Mrp4) is abundant in myeloid progenitors and tested the role of the Mrp4, an ATP transporter of monophosphorylated nucleosides, in this unexplained thiopurine sensitivity. Mrp4-deficient mice experienced Mrp4 gene dosage-dependent toxicity caused by accumulation of 6-TGNs in their myelopoietic cells. Therefore, Mrp4 protects against thiopurine-induced hematopoietic toxicity by actively exporting thiopurine nucleotides. We then identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in human MRP4 (rs3765534) that dramatically reduces MRP4 function by impairing its cell membrane localization. This SNP is common (>18%) in the Japanese population and indicates that the increased sensitivity of some Japanese patients to thiopurines may reflect the greater frequency of this MRP4 SNP.","['Krishnamurthy, Partha', 'Schwab, Matthias', 'Takenaka, Kazumasa', 'Nachagari, Deepa', 'Morgan, Jessica', 'Leslie, Mark', 'Du, Weinan', 'Boyd, Kelli', 'Cheok, Meyling', 'Nakauchi, Hiromitsu', 'Marzolini, Catia', 'Kim, Richard B', 'Poonkuzhali, Balasubramanian', 'Schuetz, Erin', 'Evans, William', 'Relling, Mary', 'Schuetz, John D']","['Krishnamurthy P', 'Schwab M', 'Takenaka K', 'Nachagari D', 'Morgan J', 'Leslie M', 'Du W', 'Boyd K', 'Cheok M', 'Nakauchi H', 'Marzolini C', 'Kim RB', 'Poonkuzhali B', 'Schuetz E', 'Evans W', 'Relling M', 'Schuetz JD']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Animal Resource Center, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytoprotection/drug effects/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/mortality', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/physiology', 'Purines/adverse effects/chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/08/06 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/13/4983 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6790 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jul 1;68(13):4983-9. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6790.,,"['P01 GM031304/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 GM060904-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM060904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM60904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM31304/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES005851-15/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 GM031304-24/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES005851/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 GM060904/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061393-090009/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA194206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ESO58571/PHS HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061374-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3323115,['NIHMS104873'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large eGFP-positive cells, surrounded by a structure resembling a zona pellucida appeared transiently in cultures of the ES cells on feeder layers. Surprisingly, they were detectable on days 1 and 2 of culture but virtually absent on day 3. Addition of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to the media significantly increased the number of eGFP-positive cels resembling oocytes. Quantitative-time PCR demonstrated a parallel increase in Gdf9 and Zp3 mRNA with changes in the abundance of eGFP-positive cells. In embryoid body cultures, eGFP-positive cells appeared transiently and then re-appeared in regional clusters after 30-45 days of culture.

The latter is a transcriptional coactivator potentiating c-Jun-mediated transcription. NF(kappa)BIA is an inhibitor of NF(kappa)B, and affects growth regulation, apoptosis and hypoxic stress.

It has become increasingly evident that transformation relies on the interdependency of both events. Among the various genetic changes, the oncogenic BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has been a focus of extensive research. Transformation by this oncogene is associated with elevated levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS have been implicated in processes that promote viability, cell growth, and regulation of other biological functions such as migration of cells or gene expression. Currently, the BCR-ABL inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) is being used as a first-line therapy for the treatment of CML. However, BCR-ABL transformation is associated with genomic instability, and disease progression or resistance to imatinib can occur. Imatinib resistance is not known to cause or significantly alter signaling requirements in transformed cells. Elevated ROS are crucial for transformation, making them an ideal additional target for therapeutic intervention. The underlying mechanisms leading to elevated oxidative stress are reviewed, and signaling mechanisms that may serve as novel targeted approaches to overcome ROS-dependent cell growth are discussed.","['Rodrigues, Margret S', 'Reddy, Mamatha M', 'Sattler, Martin']","['Rodrigues MS', 'Reddy MM', 'Sattler M']","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",,United States,Antioxid Redox Signal,Antioxidants & redox signaling,100888899,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/physiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*physiology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/07/03 09:00,2008/11/04 09:00,['2008/07/03 09:00'],"['2008/07/03 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/03 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/ars.2008.2071 [doi]'],ppublish,Antioxid Redox Signal. 2008 Oct;10(10):1813-48. doi: 10.1089/ars.2008.2071.,416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatment is based on the enzymatic removal of specific amino acids from the blood of leukemia patients. L-Lysine alpha-oxidase and catalase were coimmobilized within the void space of the porous region of asymmetric hollow-fiber membranes for the removal of L-lysine from simulated human plasma solutions. Hollow-fiber reactor performance was evaluated using a small single-fiber dialyzer (SFD) consisting of a single fiber encased in a protective glass shell. This small reactor affords ease of use, requires small amounts of chemicals and biochemicals, and gives useful reactor performance data. Single-fiber dialyzers were constructed using polyamide fibers with a molecular weight cutoff of 10,000 (PA10 fibers); these fibers demonstrated the best compatibility with and retention of the enzymes. The SFD performance in removing L-lysine from solution was evaluated under both steady and pulsatile flow operation. Pulsatile flow was tested for two reasons: (1) to enhance the radial mass transfer of lysine within the SFD and (2) to simulate the pulsatile flow of blood in dialysis treatment. The use of pulsatile flow increased lysine conversion by 15% over the steady-flow case. Approximately 40% of the lysine was removed from simulated plasma by the SFD in a 4-h experiment using pulsatile flow in the recycle mode.","['Reiken, S R', 'Briedis, D M']","['Reiken SR', 'Briedis DM']","['Department of Chemical Engineering, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-1226, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Biotechnol Bioeng,Biotechnology and bioengineering,7502021,,,,1990/02/05 00:00,1990/02/05 00:01,['1990/02/05 00:00'],"['1990/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/bit.260350307 [doi]'],ppublish,Biotechnol Bioeng. 1990 Feb 5;35(3):260-7. doi: 10.1002/bit.260350307.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this approach, we identified a novel gene, MLAA-34, which exclusively reacted with sera from allogeneic leukemia patients but not with normal donor sera. Here, we further characterized its gene structure and explored the function. We first determined both 5' and 3' end by RLM-RACE and cloned full-length cDNA of MLAA-34 in U937 cell line. Analysis of full cDNA sequence showed that MLAA-34 is highly homologous to known human gene CAB39L, but differs from two transcript splice variants of CAB39L. Thus, we propose that MLAA-34 is a novel CAB39L's splice variant associated with acute monocytic leukemia. Because the functions of MLAA-34 and CAB39L are both very unclear, then we investigated the role of MLAA-34 in U937 cell line using RNA interference technology. The results showed that the downregulation of MLAA-34 expression significantly suppressed the proliferation of U937 cells in vitro, and increased the spontaneous apoptosis of these leukemia cells. All these data indicated that MLAA-34 may be a novel anti-apoptotic factor related closely to carcinogenesis or progression of acute monocytic leukemia. The anti-apoptotic pathways of MLAA-34 remain further exploration. This study warrants further investigations to verify MLAA-34 as a promising antigen and a molecular target for therapeutic applications in acute monocytic leukemia.","['Zhang, Peng-Yu', 'Zhang, Wang-Gang', 'He, Ai-Li', 'Wang, Jian-Li', 'Li, Wen-Bin']","['Zhang PY', 'Zhang WG', 'He AL', 'Wang JL', 'Li WB']","[""Department of Clinical Hematology, Affiliated No. 2 Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University School of Medicine, The west five road, 157#, 710004, Xi'an, Shaanxi, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080701,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CAB39L protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics/immunology', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'U937 Cells']",2008/07/02 09:00,2009/01/14 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0552-z [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2009 Feb;58(2):281-90. doi: 10.1007/s00262-008-0552-z.

The results revealed that resveratrol induced neuronal differentiation of medulloblastoma cells. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 expression and phosphorylation were detected in normally cultured UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells that were apparently attenuated after resveratrol treatment. The expression of STAT3 downstream genes, survivin, cyclin D1, Cox-2, and c-Myc, was suppressed but Bcl-2 was enhanced by resveratrol. Meanwhile, the production and secretion of leukemia inhibitory factor, a STAT3 activator, became active in resveratrol-treated cells. To further ascertain the significance of STAT3 signaling for medulloblastoma cells, AG490, a selective inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation, was used to treat UW228-3 cells. Phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited by AG490 accompanied with growth suppression, differentiation-like changes, and down-regulation of survivin, cyclin D1, Cox-2, and c-Myc. Our data thus suggest the importance of STAT3 signaling in maintenance and survival of medulloblastoma cells. This signaling may be the major target of resveratrol. Enhanced leukemia inhibitory factor and Bcl-2 expressions in resveratrol-treated cells might reflect a compensatory response to the loss of STAT3 function.","['Yu, Li-Jun', 'Wu, Mo-Li', 'Li, Hong', 'Chen, Xiao-Yan', 'Wang, Qian', 'Sun, Yuan', 'Kong, Qing-You', 'Liu, Jia']","['Yu LJ', 'Wu ML', 'Li H', 'Chen XY', 'Wang Q', 'Sun Y', 'Kong QY', 'Liu J']","['Liaoning Laboratory of Cancer Genomics and Department of Cell Biology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Dalian Medical University, 116044 Dalian, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Neoplasia,"Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)",100886622,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics/*pathology', 'Neurons/drug effects/physiology', 'Resveratrol', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/09/27 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/27 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1593/neo.08304 [doi]'],ppublish,Neoplasia. 2008 Jul;10(7):736-44. doi: 10.1593/neo.08304.,,,PMC2435009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer treatment can cause severe immune suppression, which makes the patients susceptible to serious infections. The aim of the current study was to evaluate sepsis in children with tumors or haematological malignancies, describe the types of bacteria cultured and their antibiotic susceptibilities, and collect information on associated risk factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study on all children 0-15 years of age in Iceland who were diagnosed with a tumor or malignant disease between 1991 and 2000. Information was gathered on diagnosis, treatment, blood cultures, blood tests, antibiotic use, presence of foreign bodies (such as CVC) and survival. RESULTS: Hundred-and-eighteen children were diagnosed with cancer or benign central nervous system (CNS) tumors in Iceland during the period 1991-2000. Central nervous system tumors were most common (N=28, 23.7%), leukemia (N=21, 17.8%) and lymphoma (N=17, 14%) were the second and third. The mean age at diagnosis was 5.9 years. Sufficient data was found in the hospital records on 99 children who were included in the study. Five hundred and twenty two blood cultures were drawn from 51 of the 99 children during the period. The mean number of blood cultures per patient was 14.8 for children with leukemia, but 2.6 for children with solid tumors. Of all blood cultures, 63.6% were from a central venous catheter or a Port-A Catheter , 5% from a peripheral site, but 30% were undisclosed. Of the 522 blood cultures, 90 grew bacteria (17.2%). Coagulase-negative staphylococci were isolated from 53 blood cultures (60%) and Staphylococcus aureus from 12 (13%). Positive cultures were regarded as a definite or possible infection in 47 blood cultures (52%), contamination in 17 (18.9% ), but uncertain in 26 (27.7%). Over 60 percent of the blood cultures (N=302) were drawn when a child was neutropenic (ANC < or =1.0 *109/L). The mean length of neutropenic episodes was 9.0 days. The mean CRP level was 63.9 mg/L. The mean temperature was 38.8 degrees C. In 138 instances the child was receiving antibiotics at the time of culture (35.1%). Children with positive blood cultures had similar clinical and laboratory tests results as children with negative cultures. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive bacteria, especially coagulase-negative staphylococci, are much more common in children undergoing cancer therapy than Gram-negative bacteria. Results of blood tests appear to have low predictive values for blood culture results. No child died of a proven bacterial sepsis during the study period. Empiric antibiotic treatment at the Children s Hospital Iceland for children with malignant diseases is still effective.","['Alfredsdottir, Inga Huld', 'Thors, Valtyr Stefansson', 'Gudnason, Thorolfur', 'Jonmundsson, Gudmundur', 'Kristinsson, Jon R', 'Jonsson, Olafur Gisli', 'Kristinsson, Karl G', 'Haraldsson, Asgeir']","['Alfredsdottir IH', 'Thors VS', 'Gudnason T', 'Jonmundsson G', 'Kristinsson JR', 'Jonsson OG', 'Kristinsson KG', 'Haraldsson A']",,['ice'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Iceland,Laeknabladid,Laeknabladid,7901326,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gram-Negative Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Gram-Positive Bacteria/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Iceland', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Laeknabladid. 2008 Jul;94(7-8):531-9.,,,,,Blodsykingar barna med aexli og illkynja sjukdoma 1991-2000.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Exons 7 and 9 of WT1 were screened in samples from 470 young adult NK AMLs using a combination of direct sequencing and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis. RESULTS: Overall, 51 mutations were detected in 47 cases (10%): 46 frameshift mutations with insertion/deletion of one to 28 base pairs in exon 7 (n = 45) or exon 9 (n = 1), with a median mutant level of 45% (range, 8% to 86%), and five substitutions in exon 9: D396N (n = 3), H397Y (n = 1) and H397Q (n = 1). Patients with WT1 mutations had an inferior response to induction chemotherapy compared with wild-type cases (complete remission rate, 79% v 90%, odds ratio [OR] = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.17 to 7.82; P = .02), a higher rate of resistant disease (15% v 4%; OR = 9.33; 95% CI, 2.38 to 36.6; P = .001), an increased cumulative incidence of relapse (67% v 43%, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.69 to 5.38; P = .0008), with a reduction in both relapse-free survival (22% v 44%; HR = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.55; P = .005) and overall survival (26% v 47%; HR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.95; P = .007) at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, which included FLT3 internal tandem duplication and NPM1 mutation status, the presence of a WT1 mutation remained an independent adverse prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: WT1 mutations are a negative prognostic indicator in NK AML and may be suitable for the development of targeted therapy.","['Virappane, Priya', 'Gale, Rosemary', 'Hills, Robert', 'Kakkas, Ioannis', 'Summers, Karin', 'Stevens, Jane', 'Allen, Christopher', 'Green, Claire', 'Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Drexler, Hans', 'Burnett, Alan', 'Linch, David', 'Bonnet, Dominique', 'Lister, T Andrew', 'Fitzgibbon, Jude']","['Virappane P', 'Gale R', 'Hills R', 'Kakkas I', 'Summers K', 'Stevens J', 'Allen C', 'Green C', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler H', 'Burnett A', 'Linch D', 'Bonnet D', 'Lister TA', 'Fitzgibbon J']","['Centre for Medical Oncology, Institute of Cancer, Barts and the London School of Medicine, Charterhouse Square, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080630,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Female', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/12/25 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/25 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2008.16.0333 [doi]', 'JCO.2008.16.0333 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Nov 20;26(33):5429-35. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.16.0333.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: AML patients age 60 years and older in first complete remission after induction and consolidation chemotherapy were randomly assigned to no further therapy or a 90-day regimen of 14-day cycles of low-dose rIL-2, aimed at expanding natural killer (NK) cells, followed by 3-day higher doses aimed at activating cytotoxicity of expanded NK cells to lyse residual AML cells. All randomly assigned patients were included in an intention-to-treat analysis. RESULTS: A total of 163 (64%) of 254 patients who completed induction and consolidation chemotherapy on CALGB 9720 were randomly assigned to rIL-2 (n = 81) or no further therapy (n = 82); the most common reasons for lack of random assignment were patient refusal and relapse. Fifteen patients randomly assigned to rIL-2 never initiated it because of refusal, intercurrent medical problems, or relapse, and 24 patients initiated rIL-2 but stopped early because of toxicity or relapse. Grade 4 toxicities during rIL-2 therapy included thrombocytopenia (65%) and neutropenia (64%), and grade 3 toxicities included anemia (33%), infection (24%) and malaise/fatigue (14%). Forty-two patients (52%) randomly assigned to rIL-2 completed the full 90-day course. Patients in both arms had similar distributions of both disease-free (combined median = 6.1 months; P = .47) and overall survival (combined median = 14.7 months; P = .61) after random assignment. Moreover, the 42 patients who completed all planned therapy did not show prolongation of disease-free or overall survival. CONCLUSION: Low-dose rIL-2 maintenance immunotherapy is not a successful strategy in older AML patients.","['Baer, Maria R', 'George, Stephen L', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Sanford, Ben L', 'Bothun, Sandra M', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Moore, Joseph O', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Anastasi, John', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Larson, Richard A']","['Baer MR', 'George SL', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Sanford BL', 'Bothun SM', 'Mrozek K', 'Kolitz JE', 'Powell BL', 'Moore JO', 'Stone RM', 'Anastasi J', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Larson RA']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. mbaer@umm.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080630,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2008.17.0472 [doi]', 'JCO.2008.17.0472 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 20;26(30):4934-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2008.17.0472.

Nullifying the antiapoptotic influence of these proteins can potentially overcome this resistance, and may complement conventional chemotherapy. ABT-737 is a BH3-only mimetic and potent inhibitor of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and Bcl-w. In vitro, ABT-737 exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity against a broad panel of lymphoma cell lines including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). ABT-737 showed synergism when combined with the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib or carfilzomib in select lymphoma cell lines and induced potent mitochondrial membrane depolarization and apoptosis when combined with either. ABT-737 plus bortezomib also induced significant apoptosis in primary samples of MCL, DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) but no significant cytotoxic effect was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. In severe combined immunodeficient beige mouse models of MCL, the addition of ABT-737 to bortezomib enhanced efficacy compared with either drug alone and with the control.

These encounters promote plasma cell differentiation and antibody production. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the TLR system in enhancing antibody-mediated defense against infections and maintaining memory B cells. These results have led the way to the design of vaccines that target B cells by engaging TLRs. In hematologic malignancies, cells often retain B cell-specific receptors and associated functions. Among these, TLRs are currently exploited to target different subclasses of B-cell leukemia, and TLR agonists are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, accumulating evidence suggests that endogenous TLR ligands or chronic infections promote tumor growth, thus providing a need for further investigations to decipher the exact function of TLRs in the B-cell lineage and in neoplastic B cells. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the latest advances with regard to the expression and function of TLRs in both healthy and malignant B cells. Special attention will be focused on the growth-promoting effects of TLR ligands on leukemic B cells and their potential clinical impact.","['Chiron, David', 'Bekeredjian-Ding, Isabelle', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Bataille, Regis', 'Jego, Gaetan']","['Chiron D', 'Bekeredjian-Ding I', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Bataille R', 'Jego G']","['Inserm U892, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080630,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptors)']",IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/pathology', 'Toll-Like Receptors/*immunology']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2008-02-140673 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)59842-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 15;112(6):2205-13. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-02-140673.

The sensitivity of CML to donor lymphocyte infusion after allogeneic stem cell transplantation suggests this tumor can be highly susceptible to cellular immunotherapy targeted to tumor associated antigens. We therefore tested whether functional PRAME-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (PRAME CTLs) could be generated and expanded from healthy donors and CML patients, or whether the limited immunogenicity of this CTA coupled with tumor-associated anergy would preclude this approach. Using optimized culture conditions and HLA-A*02-restricted PRAME-peptides, we have consistently generated PRAME CTLs from 8/9 healthy donors and 5/6 CML patients. These CTLs released IFNgamma in response to PRAME peptides (between 113 +/- 8 and 795 +/- 23 spot forming cells/10(5) T cells) and lysed PRAME peptide-loaded cells (45 +/- 19% at an effector:target [E:T] ratio of 20:1) in a MHC-restricted fashion.

PRAME CTLs were generated almost exclusively from the naive T-cell compartment, and clonal analysis showed these cells could have high alphabetaTCR-peptide avidity.

Treatment with pan-HDAC inhibitors or depletion of HDAC6 by siRNA induces hyperacetylation and inhibits ATP binding and chaperone function of hsp90. Treatment with 17-allylamino-demothoxy geldanamycin (17-AAG) also inhibits ATP binding and chaperone function of hsp90, resulting in polyubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation of hsp90 client proteins. In this study, we determined the effect of hsp90 hyperacetylation on the anti-hsp90 and antileukemia activity of 17-AAG. Hyperacetylation of hsp90 increased its binding to 17-AAG, as well as enhanced 17-AAG-mediated attenuation of ATP and the cochaperone p23 binding to hsp90. Notably, treatment with 17-AAG alone also reduced HDAC6 binding to hsp90 and induced hyperacetylation of hsp90. This promoted the proteasomal degradation of HDAC6. Cotreatment with 17-AAG and siRNA to HDAC6 induced more inhibition of hsp90 chaperone function and depletion of BCR-ABL and c-Raf than treatment with either agent alone. In addition, cotreatment with 17-AAG and tubacin augmented the loss of survival of K562 cells and viability of primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) samples. These findings demonstrate that HDAC6 is an hsp90 client protein and hyperacetylation of hsp90 augments the anti-hsp90 and antileukemia effects of 17-AAG.","['Rao, Rekha', 'Fiskus, Warren', 'Yang, Yonghua', 'Lee, Pearl', 'Joshi, Rajeshree', 'Fernandez, Pravina', 'Mandawat, Aditya', 'Atadja, Peter', 'Bradner, James E', 'Bhalla, Kapil']","['Rao R', 'Fiskus W', 'Yang Y', 'Lee P', 'Joshi R', 'Fernandez P', 'Mandawat A', 'Atadja P', 'Bradner JE', 'Bhalla K']","['Medical College of Georgia (MCG) Cancer Center, Augusta, GA 30912, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080630,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 6)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Benzoquinones/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 6', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2008-03-143644 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)49623-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1886-93. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-143644.

However, mechanisms underlying apoptotic inhibition have not been fully elucidated. In many settings, apoptosis occurs by mitochondrial cytochrome c release, which nucleates the Apaf-1/caspase-9 apoptosome. Here we report that the leukemogenic kinases, Bcr-Abl, FLT3/D835Y, and Tel-PDGFRbeta, all can inhibit apoptosome function. In cells expressing these kinases, the previously reported apoptosome inhibitor, Hsp90beta, bound strongly to Apaf-1, preventing cytochrome c-induced Apaf-1 oligomerization and caspase-9 recruitment. Hsp90beta interacted weakly with the apoptosome in untransformed cells. While Hsp90beta was phosphorylated at Ser 226/Ser 255 in untransformed cells, phosphorylation was absent in leukemic cells. Expression of mutant Hsp90beta (S226A/S255A), which mimics the hypophosphorylated form in leukemic cells, conferred resistance to cytochrome c-induced apoptosome activation in normal cells, reflecting enhanced binding of nonphosphorylatable Hsp90beta to Apaf-1. In Bcr-Abl-positive mouse bone marrow cells, nonphosphorylatable Hsp90beta expression conferred imatinib (Gleevec) resistance. These data provide an explanation for apoptosome inhibition by activated leukemogenic tyrosine kinases and suggest that alterations in Hsp90beta-apoptosome interactions may contribute to chemoresistance in leukemias.","['Kurokawa, Manabu', 'Zhao, Chen', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Kornbluth, Sally']","['Kurokawa M', 'Zhao C', 'Reya T', 'Kornbluth S']","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3813, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080630,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Apoptosomes)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90AB1 protein, human)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosomes/*metabolism', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/enzymology', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1128/MCB.00265-08 [doi]', 'MCB.00265-08 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2008 Sep;28(17):5494-506. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00265-08.

Identification of the SOCS box domain led to the hypothesis that SOCS3 can associate with functional E3 ubiquitin ligases and thereby induce the degradation of bound signalling proteins. This model relies upon an interaction between the SOCS box, elonginBC and a cullin protein that forms the E3 ligase scaffold. We have investigated this interaction in vitro using purified components and show that SOCS3 binds to elonginBC and cullin5 with high affinity. The SOCS3-elonginBC interaction was further characterised by determining the solution structure of the SOCS box-elonginBC ternary complex and by deletion and alanine scanning mutagenesis of the SOCS box. These studies revealed that conformational flexibility is a key feature of the SOCS-elonginBC interaction. In particular, the SOCS box is disordered in isolation and only becomes structured upon elonginBC association. The interaction depends upon the first 12 residues of the SOCS box domain and particularly on a deeply buried, conserved leucine. The SOCS box, when bound to elonginBC, binds tightly to cullin5 with 100 nM affinity. Domains upstream of the SOCS box are not required for elonginBC or cullin5 association, indicating that the SOCS box acts as an independent binding domain capable of recruiting elonginBC and cullin5 to promote E3 ligase formation.","['Babon, Jeffrey J', 'Sabo, Jennifer K', 'Soetopo, Alfreda', 'Yao, Shenggen', 'Bailey, Michael F', 'Zhang, Jian-Guo', 'Nicola, Nicos A', 'Norton, Raymond S']","['Babon JJ', 'Sabo JK', 'Soetopo A', 'Yao S', 'Bailey MF', 'Zhang JG', 'Nicola NA', 'Norton RS']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia. babon@wehi.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080620,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (Elongin)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Socs3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (cullin5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",IM,"['Alanine/metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Calorimetry', 'Cullin Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Elongin', 'Epitopes', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutant Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ultracentrifugation', 'src Homology Domains']",2008/07/02 09:00,2008/09/06 09:00,['2008/07/02 09:00'],"['2008/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/11 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/02 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00740-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.06.038 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Sep 12;381(4):928-40. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.06.038.

MRD was evaluated simultaneous by RQ-PCR assay to detect NPM1-mutated and WT1 expression. RESULTS: The expression levels of WT1 and NPM1 in 93 paired samples showed a strong positive correlation (r=0.81; p<0.0001). However, the kinetics of disappearance were different, WT1 decreased rapidly after induction but maintained these residual levels after treatment in patients in complete remission, whereas NPM1 experienced a mild reduction after induction but was undetectable in long survivor patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the feasibility of the RQ-PCR assay to monitor MRD in AML patients carrying NPM1 mutations and its advantage over RQ-PCR assay for WT1.

One of points needed to be clarified is prognostic significance of complex karyotype (at least 3 unrelated abnormalities). We investigated characteristic features of complex karyotype in newly diagnosed pediatric AML de novo. Cell clones with complex karyotype were found in 35 of 254 (13.8%) patients at the age from 0 to 15 years studied prior to therapy. The group was divided into 2 subgroups depending on presence of favorable chromosome abnormalities, i.e. (see symbols)(8;21), t(15;17) and inv(16). The abnormalities were absent in 20 cases (1st subgroup), in 15 remaining patients they were identified (2nd subgroup). In 2nd subgroup karyotypes were not so considerably changed and no adverse risk markers were detected as distinct from 1st subgroup. New data were obtained for complex karyotype differences of adult and pediatric AML. In the great majority (76%) of complex karyotypes in our adult patients chromosome abnormalities associated with adverse risk were found but in pediatric patients their frequency was significantly less (30%). The highest rate of complex karyotype we observed in children at the age from 0 to 3 years. Similar data were not published earlier. Complex karyotype is considered to be characteristic of older AML patients and in the majority of the patients the karyotype contains markers of adverse risk. Possibly, worse outcome in older AML patients is connected with the markers but not with multiple chromosome changes. New data of frequency and the peculiarities of complex karyotype in pediatric AML are important for understanding of AML pathogenesis and for development a more effective AML treatment.","['Fleishman, E V', 'Sokova, O I', 'Kirichenko, O P', 'Konstantinova, L N', ""Metel'kova, N F"", 'Popa, A V', 'Shneider, M M']","['Fleishman EV', 'Sokova OI', 'Kirichenko OP', 'Konstantinova LN', ""Metel'kova NF"", 'Popa AV', 'Shneider MM']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",,Russia (Federation),Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,9215641,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk. 2008;(5):3-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Solution structures of myeloid cell leukaemia-1 (Mcl-1) in complex with the BH3 domains from Noxa and Puma, two proteins regulated by the tumour suppressor p53, show that they bind as amphipathic alpha-helices in the same hydrophobic groove of Mcl-1, using conserved residues for binding. Thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of Noxa, Puma and the related BH3 domains of Bmf, Bim, Bid and Bak with Mcl-1 were determined by calorimetry. These unstructured BH3 domains bind Mcl-1 with affinities that span 3 orders of magnitude, and binding is an enthalpically driven and entropy-enthalpy-compensated process. Alanine scanning analysis of Noxa demonstrated that only a subset of residues is required for interaction with Mcl-1, and these residues are localised to a short highly conserved sequence motif that defines the BH3 domain. Chemical shift mapping of Mcl-1:BH3 complexes showed that Mcl-1 engages all BH3 ligands in a similar way and that, in addition to changes in the immediate vicinity of the binding site, small molecule-wide structural adjustments accommodate ligand binding. Our studies show that unstructured peptides, such as the BH3 domains, behave like their structured counterparts and can bind tightly and selectively in an enthalpically driven process.","['Day, Catherine L', 'Smits, Callum', 'Fan, F Cindy', 'Lee, Erinna F', 'Fairlie, W Douglas', 'Hinds, Mark G']","['Day CL', 'Smits C', 'Fan FC', 'Lee EF', 'Fairlie WD', 'Hinds MG']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Otago, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080604,England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Conserved Sequence', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Ligands', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Temperature', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/07/24 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-2836(08)00663-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.05.071 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 2008 Jul 25;380(5):958-71. doi: 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.05.071.

It is being developed for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), autoimmune disease and for the prevention of transplant rejection. This study focused on synthesis, quality control, in vitro evaluation and biodistribution of (188)Re-labeled alemtuzumab for radioimmunotherapy of B-cell CLL. (188)Re-alemtuzumab was synthesized using a direct radiolabeling method. Reduction of the intramolecular disulfide bonds of the antibody was performed with tris-(carboxyethyl)-phosphine (Pierce), using a 1:60 molar excess. Reaction took place at room temperature for 20 min. A PD-10 desalting column was used to purify the reduced antibody from excess phospine. Complexation and transchelation of (188)ReO(4)(-) was achieved using sodium gluconate as weak chelator and SnCl(2) as reducing agent. Quality control was done using instant thin-layer chromatography. Binding assays were performed on a CD52-positive cell line (HuT-78). Female NMRI mice were injected intravenously with 20 microg radiolabeled alemtuzumab and killed at preset time intervals for biodistribution studies. Tissues were dissected, weighed and counted for determination of radioactivity. Data were expressed as percentage injected activity per gram of tissue (% IA/g tissue) or as percentage injected activity (% IA). (188)Re-alemtuzumab was prepared achieving high radiochemical yields. Labeling efficiency of more than 95% can be obtained using optimal reaction conditions. (188)Re-alemtuzumab showed good in vitro stability, remaining intact at 24 h after radiolabeling. In mice, (188)Re-alemtuzumab showed high uptake in the blood (25.10+/-1.36% IA at 1 h p.i.), followed by a biexponential clearance (t(1/2alpha)=4.790 h and t(1/2beta)=55.45 h). Increased uptake was observed in kidneys and heart (9.29+/-0.46% IA/g in kidneys and 6.10+/-1.82% IA/g in heart at 1 p.i.). The highest absorbed radiation dose was received by the kidneys (0.159-3.26 mGy/MBq) and heart wall (0.0705-0.132 mGy/MBq). The predicted radiation dose for the total body was in the range of 0.0459-0.0529 mGy/MBq. The effective dose for the human reference adult was estimated to be approximately 0.0486-0.195 mSv/MBq. (188)Re-alemtuzumab can be prepared with high radiochemical yield and purity and showed good in vitro behavior and favorable biodistribution. Therefore, (188)Re-alemtuzumab would be an ideal candidate for radioimmunotherapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['De Decker, Mario', 'Bacher, Klaus', 'Thierens, Hubert', 'Slegers, Guido', 'Dierckx, Rudi A', 'De Vos, Filip']","['De Decker M', 'Bacher K', 'Thierens H', 'Slegers G', 'Dierckx RA', 'De Vos F']","['Department of Radiopharmacy, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium. mario.dedecker@health.wa.gov.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Nucl Med Biol,Nuclear medicine and biology,9304420,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '7440-15-5 (Rhenium)']",IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Thin Layer', 'Drug Stability', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Quality Control', 'Radioimmunotherapy/*methods', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/chemical synthesis/*therapeutic use', '*Rhenium', 'Tissue Distribution']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2007/10/05 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0969-8051(08)00073-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2008.03.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucl Med Biol. 2008 Jul;35(5):599-604. doi: 10.1016/j.nucmedbio.2008.03.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we have demonstrated that treatment of different human breast cancer cell lines with honokiol resulted in a time- and concentration-dependent growth inhibition in both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cell lines, as well as in drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines such as adriamycin-resistant and tamoxifen-resistant cell lines. The inhibition of growth was associated with a G1-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. The effects of honokiol might be reversely related to the expression level of human epidermal growth receptor 2, (HER-2, also known as erbB2, c-erbB2) since knockdown of her-2 expression by siRNA significantly enhanced the sensitivity of the her-2 over-expressed BT-474 cells to the honokiol-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of HER-2 signalling by specific human epidermal growth receptor 1/HER-2 (EGFR/HER-2) kinase inhibitor lapatinib synergistically enhanced the anti-cancer effects of honokiol in her-2 over-expressed breast cancer cells. Finally, we showed that honokiol was able to attenuate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR (Phosphoinositide 3-kinases/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and upregulation of PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homolog deleted on chromosome Ten) expression. Combination of honokiol with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin presented synergistic effects on induction of apoptosis of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, honokiol, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, could serve as a new, promising approach for breast cancer treatment.","['Liu, Hongyu', 'Zang, Chuanbing', 'Emde, Anna', 'Planas-Silva, Maricarmen D', 'Rosche, Marleen', 'Kuhnl, Andrea', 'Schulz, Carsten-Oliver', 'Elstner, Elena', 'Possinger, Kurt', 'Eucker, Jan']","['Liu H', 'Zang C', 'Emde A', 'Planas-Silva MD', 'Rosche M', 'Kuhnl A', 'Schulz CO', 'Elstner E', 'Possinger K', 'Eucker J']","['Department of Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Charite, Humboldt University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080612,Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,"['0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Lignans)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lapatinib', 'Lignans/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Magnolia/chemistry', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/administration & dosage', 'Time Factors']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/16 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2007/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/26 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0014-2999(08)00637-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.06.026 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2008 Sep 4;591(1-3):43-51. doi: 10.1016/j.ejphar.2008.06.026.

The lack of survival benefit seen with the use of amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmB-D) as EAFT has been attributed to its toxicities. More recently, newer, less toxic and more expensive antifungal agents such as the lipid formulations of AmB, the newer azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole) and caspofungin have been analysed in a number of EAFT trials. Compared with AmB-D the newer agents have superior safety but are of equivalent efficacy. This lack of survival advantage is related to the fact that the trigger for commencement of EAFT is late and non-specific. Thus, alternative approaches are required. New sensitive serological and molecular tests for the detection of Aspergillus antigens and genomic DNA have been developed and evaluated in accuracy studies. These tests have been incorporated into management strategies (i.e. pre-emptive strategies) to direct antifungal therapy. The pre-emptive approach has been shown to be safe and feasible but its impact on clinically important patient outcomes such as survival is less clear. Other advances include the introduction of effective, non-toxic mould-active antifungal prophylaxis and patient risk-group stratification. In this paper we provide new evidence-based algorithms for the diagnosis and treatment of PFUO in adult patients undergoing stem cell transplantation and chemotherapy for haematological malignancy which incorporate these newer diagnostic tests and are directed by the risk category of the patient and type of antifungal prophylaxis the patient is receiving.","['Morrissey, C O', 'Bardy, P G', 'Slavin, M A', 'Ananda-Rajah, M R', 'Chen, S C', 'Kirsa, S W', 'Ritchie, D S', 'Upton, A']","['Morrissey CO', 'Bardy PG', 'Slavin MA', 'Ananda-Rajah MR', 'Chen SC', 'Kirsa SW', 'Ritchie DS', 'Upton A']","['Infectious Diseases Unit, The Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, VIC. o.morrissey@alfred.org.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",,Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Antigens, Fungal)', '0 (Mannans)', '0 (beta-Glucans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', '9051-97-2 (beta-1,3-glucan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Fungal/analysis', 'Aspergillus/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Fever of Unknown Origin/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Mannans/analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'beta-Glucans/analysis']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['IMJ1724 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1445-5994.2008.01724.x [doi]']",ppublish,Intern Med J. 2008 Jun;38(6b):477-95. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.2008.01724.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evidence for prophylaxis is less clear in other clinical settings although certain groups such as patients with prolonged neutropenia after stem cell transplants using bone marrow or cord blood sources and with impaired cell mediated immunity secondary to treatments such as Alemtuzumab are at high risk. The decision to use prophylaxis and which agent to use will be influenced by effectiveness, number needed to treat and the likelihood of toxicity and drug interactions. The availability of rapid diagnostic tests for fungal infection and institutional epidemiology will also influence the need for and choice of prophylaxis. Whilst prophylaxis can be beneficial, it may impede the ability to make a rapid diagnosis of fungal infection by reducing the yield of diagnostic tests and change the epidemiology of fungal infection. As non-culture based diagnostic tests are refined and become more available there may be a shift from prophylaxis to early diagnosis and treatment.","['Slavin, M A', 'Heath, C H', 'Thursky, K A', 'Morrissey, C O', 'Szer, J', 'Ling, L M', 'Milliken, S T', 'Grigg, A P']","['Slavin MA', 'Heath CH', 'Thursky KA', 'Morrissey CO', 'Szer J', 'Ling LM', 'Milliken ST', 'Grigg AP']","['Clinical Centre of Research Excellence in Infectious Diseases, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC.

In order to explore how different classes of targeted therapies impact upon resistance mutations, we performed EGFR (epidermal-growth-factor receptor) resistance mutation screens with erlotinib, lapatinib and CI-1033. Distinct mutation spectra were generated with each inhibitor and were reflective of their respective mechanisms of action. Lapatinib yielded the widest variety of mutations, whereas mutational variability was lower in the erlotinib and CI-1033 screens. Lapatinib was uniquely sensitive to mutations of residues located deep within the selectivity pocket, whereas mutation of either Gly(796) or Cys(797) resulted in a dramatic loss of CI-1033 potency. The clinically observed T790M mutation was common to all inhibitors, but occurred with varying frequencies. Importantly, the presence of C797S with T790M in the same EGFR allele conferred complete resistance to erlotinib, lapatinib and CI-1033. The combination of erlotinib and CI-1033 effectively reduced the number of drug-resistant clones, suggesting a possible clinical strategy to overcome drug resistance. Interestingly, our results also indicate that co-expression of ErbB2 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue 2) has an impact upon the EGFR resistance mutations obtained, suggesting that ErbB2 may play an active role in the acquisition of drug-resistant mutations.","['Avizienyte, Egle', 'Ward, Richard A', 'Garner, Andrew P']","['Avizienyte E', 'Ward RA', 'Garner AP']","['AstraZeneca, Cancer and Infection Research Area, Macclesfield SK10 4TG, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'C78W1K5ASF (Canertinib)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'ErbB Receptors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Lapatinib', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2008/07/01 09:00,2009/01/06 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJ20080728 [pii]', '10.1042/BJ20080728 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2008 Oct 15;415(2):197-206. doi: 10.1042/BJ20080728.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two most widely used cell permeable CK2 inhibitors, TBB (4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzotriazole) and DMAT (2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole), are marketed as quite specific CK2 blockers. In the present study we show, by using a panel of approx. 80 protein kinases, that DMAT and its parent compound TBI (or TBBz; 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole) are potent inhibitors of several other kinases, with special reference to PIM (provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukaemia virus)1, PIM2, PIM3, PKD1 (protein kinase D1), HIPK2 (homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2) and DYRK1a (dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylated and -regulated kinase 1a). In contrast, TBB is significantly more selective toward CK2, although it also inhibits PIM1 and PIM3. In an attempt to improve selectivity towards CK2 a library of 68 TBB/TBI-related compounds have been tested for their ability to discriminate between CK2, PIM1, HIPK2 and DYRK1a, ending up with seven compounds whose efficacy toward CK2 is markedly higher than that toward the second most inhibited kinase. Two of these, K64 (3,4,5,6,7-pentabromo-1H-indazole) and K66 (1-carboxymethyl-2-dimethylamino-4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-benzimidazole), display an overall selectivity much higher than TBB and DMAT when tested on a panel of 80 kinases and display similar efficacy as inducers of apoptosis.","['Pagano, Mario A', 'Bain, Jenny', 'Kazimierczuk, Zygmunt', 'Sarno, Stefania', 'Ruzzene, Maria', 'Di Maira, Giovanni', 'Elliott, Matthew', 'Orzeszko, Andrzej', 'Cozza, Giorgio', 'Meggio, Flavio', 'Pinna, Lorenzo A']","['Pagano MA', 'Bain J', 'Kazimierczuk Z', 'Sarno S', 'Ruzzene M', 'Di Maira G', 'Elliott M', 'Orzeszko A', 'Cozza G', 'Meggio F', 'Pinna LA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and CNR Institute of Neurosciences, University of Padova, viale G.

This mAb is active in previously treated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) refractory to alkylating agents and purine nucleoside analogs. Alemtuzumab is also investigated in previously untreated patients with this leukemia. The results of a prospective randomized Phase III study (CAM307 trial) comparing chlorambucil with alemtuzumab in the first-line treatment of progressive B-CLL were recently published. The overall response rate, complete remission rate, and progression-free survival were all superior for alemtuzumab. Moreover, elimination of minimal residual disease occurred in one third of complete responders to alemtuzumab and none to chlorambucil. Adverse events were similar in both arms with the exception of infusion-related reactions and cytomegalovirus infections. In 2001, alemtuzumab was approved in the USA and Europe as a third-line therapy for patients with B-CLL who had been treated with alkylating agents and failed fludarabine therapy. In September 2007, the US FDA, on the basis of CAM307 results, approved alemtuzumab for the treatment of previously untreated patients with B-CLL. Moreover, the European Commission recently granted marketing authorization to alemtuzumab for the treatment of patients with B-CLL for whom fludarabine combination monotherapy is not appropriate.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, 93-510 Lodz, ul.

Through the application of principal components analysis (PCA), we were able to data mine and prove that approximately 89% of the total log GI 50 variance is due to the nonspecific cytotoxic nature of substances. Furthermore, PCA led to the identification of groups of structurally unrelated substances showing very specific toxicity profiles, such as a set of 45 substances toxic only to the Leukemia_SR cancer cell line. In an effort to predict nonspecific cytotoxicity on the basis of the mean log GI 50, we created a decision tree using MACCS keys that can correctly classify over 83% of the substances as cytotoxic/noncytotoxic in silico, on the basis of the cutoff of mean log GI 50 = -5.0. Finally, we have established a linear model using least-squares in which nine of the 59 available NCI60 cancer cell lines can be used to predict the mean log GI 50. The model has R (2) = 0.99 and a root-mean-square deviation between the observed and calculated mean log GI 50 (RMSE) = 0.09.

The expression of CTA is mainly restricted to the testis and various tumors. In contrast to other CTA, PRAME expression is also frequently detected in acute and chronic leukemias. Due to this expression pattern, PRAME has attracted great interest as a prognostic tumor marker that can be used for the detection of minimal residual disease and as a potential target for immunotherapy. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), PRAME expression has been observed in 30-64% of cases. To evaluate whether epigenetic mechanisms contribute to PRAME activation in AML, we studied DNA methylation of 15 CpG dinucleotides within a CpG-rich region located in the intron 1 of the PRAME gene. DNA methylation was determined by sequence analysis of cloned PCR products generated from bisulfite-treated genomic DNA. Methylation patterns were correlated with PRAME mRNA levels as determined by microarray analysis and real-time PCR. We found almost complete methylation in mononuclear blood cells from two healthy donors and in bone marrow cells of four PRAME-negative AML patients. In contrast, the degree of PRAME methylation was clearly reduced in four PRAME-positive AML bone marrow samples. In particular, these samples were characterized by the presence of clones, which were completely devoid of methylation. The significant inverse correlation between the degree of methylation and PRAME expression suggests a causal role of DNA methylation in PRAME regulation. Such a role is further supported by the observation that treatment of PRAME-negative cell lines U-937 and THP-1 with the demethylating agent 5'-Aza-2'dC resulted in a dose-related upregulation of PRAME expression.","['Ortmann, Christina A', 'Eisele, Lewin', 'Nuckel, Holger', 'Klein-Hitpass, Ludger', 'Fuhrer, Anja', 'Duhrsen, Ulrich', 'Zeschnigk, Michael']","['Ortmann CA', 'Eisele L', 'Nuckel H', 'Klein-Hitpass L', 'Fuhrer A', 'Duhrsen U', 'Zeschnigk M']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Zentrum fur Konservative Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Hufelandstrasse 55, 45122, Essen, Germany. christina.ortmann@uk-essen.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080628,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/16 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0514-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Oct;87(10):809-18. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0514-8.

Our hypothesis was that mast cell degranulation might require the FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK activity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: In rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL-2H3) cells, the effects of directly inhibiting M2PK or preventing the FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK (disinhibition) on degranulation was measured by hexosaminidase release. Effects of blocking the FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK was also assessed in vivo in a mouse model of allergen-induced airway hyper-responsiveness. KEY RESULTS: Activation of FcvarepsilonRI in RBL-2H3 cells caused the rapid phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in M2PK, associated with a decrease in M2PK enzymatic activity. There was an inverse correlation between M2PK activity and mast cell degranulation. FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK involved Src kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC and calcium. Direct inhibition of M2PK potentiated FcvarepsilonRI-mediated degranulation and prevention of the FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK attenuated mast cell degranulation. Transfection of RBL-2H3 cells with M1PK which prevents FcvarepsilonRI-induced inhibition of M2PK, markedly reduced their degranulation and exogenous M1PK (i.p.) inhibited ovalbumin-induced airway hyper-responsiveness in vivo. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: We have identified a new control point and a novel biochemical pathway in the process of mast cell degranulation. Our study suggests that the FcvarepsilonRI-mediated inhibition of M2PK is a crucial step in responses to allergens. Moreover, the manipulation of glycolytic processes and intermediates could provide novel strategies for the treatment of allergic diseases.","['Ryu, H', 'Walker, J K L', 'Kim, S', 'Koo, N', 'Barak, L S', 'Noguchi, T', 'Kang, B Y', 'Kim, K-M']","['Ryu H', 'Walker JK', 'Kim S', 'Koo N', 'Barak LS', 'Noguchi T', 'Kang BY', 'Kim KM']","['Department of Pharmacology, Research Institute of Drug Development, College of Pharmacy, Chonnam National University, Kwang-Ju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.40 (Pyruvate Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bronchial Hyperreactivity/enzymology/immunology/prevention & control', 'Calcium/metabolism', '*Cell Degranulation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Glycolysis', 'Hexosaminidases/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/drug effects/*enzymology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Ovalbumin', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Pyruvate Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008148 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.148 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Jul;154(5):1035-46. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.148.

Arsenic trioxide (As2O3) is effective for treatment of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), yet the mechanism of action of this drug is still widely debated. Recently, As2O3 was shown to inhibit the activity of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). TrxR has been proposed to be required for selenium metabolism. The effect of inhibitors of TrxR on selenium metabolism has yet to be assessed. This study aims to determine whether chemotherapeutics that target selenocysteine within selenoenzymes may also affect the metabolism of selenium. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A lung cell line, A549, was used to assess the effect of TrxR inhibitors on selenium metabolism, using 75Se-selenite. The level of mRNA encoding cytosolic TrxR (TrxR1) was determined using real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR. TrxR activity was determined in whole-cell extracts. KEY RESULTS: Exposure of cells to As2O3, arsenite or auranofin led to a concentration-dependent reduction of selenium metabolism into selenoproteins. Knockdown of TrxR1, using small inhibitory RNA, did not affect selenium metabolism. Exposure of cells to monomethylarsonic acid, a potent inhibitor of TrxR, did not alter selenium metabolism but did inhibit enzyme activity. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: As2O3 and auranofin block the metabolism of selenium in A549 cells. Because As2O3 is used to treat APL, our findings may reveal the mechanism of this therapeutic action and lead to further research targeting selenium metabolism to find novel chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of APL.","['Talbot, S', 'Nelson, R', 'Self, W T']","['Talbot S', 'Nelson R', 'Self WT']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Burnett College of Biomedical Science, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080421,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Selenium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Selenoproteins)', '0 (Sodium Compounds)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', '48OVY2OC72 (sodium arsenite)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (TXNRD1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.8.1.9 (Thioredoxin Reductase 1)', 'HIW548RQ3W (Sodium Selenite)', 'J37VJ5709S (monomethylarsonic acid)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Auranofin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis/drug effects', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Selenium Radioisotopes', 'Selenoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Sodium Selenite/metabolism', 'Thioredoxin Reductase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/03 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008161 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Jul;154(5):940-8. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.161.

Recent studies have provided evidence that cagA-positive Helicobacter pylori plays a causal role for the development of gastric carcinoma. The cagA-encoded CagA protein is delivered into H. pylori-attached gastric epithelial cells via the bacterial type IV secretion system (TFSS). Delivered CagA undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family kinases at the conserved EPIYA motifs and then specifically binds and deregulates SHP-2 tyrosine phosphatase, a bona fide oncoprotein involved in human malignancies. As a result, CagA causes aberrant mitogenic signal as well as elevated cell motility in gastric epithelial cells. Also, CagA specifically interacts with and inhibits PAR1b/MARK2 polarity-regulating kinase to disrupt tight junctions and cause loss of epithelial apical-basolateral cell polarity. These CagA activities have been suspected to play an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. Indeed, recently generated cagA-transgenic mice expressing CagA systemically developed gastrointestinal carcinomas as well hematopoietic malignancies such as myeloid leukemia and B-cell lymphoma. The observations collectively indicate that H. pylori CagA is the first identified bacterial oncoprotein involved in gastric carcinogenesis.","['Hatakeyama, Masanori']",['Hatakeyama M'],"['Division of Molecular Oncology, Institute for Genetic Medicine, Hokkaido University, Japan.']",['jpn'],['Journal Article'],,Japan,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi,Nihon Rinsho Men'eki Gakkai kaishi = Japanese journal of clinical immunology,9505992,"['0 (Antigens, Bacterial)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (cagA protein, Helicobacter pylori)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Bacterial/*analysis', 'Bacterial Proteins/*analysis', 'Helicobacter pylori/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins/*analysis', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*etiology']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['JST.JSTAGE/jsci/31.132 [pii]', '10.2177/jsci.31.132 [doi]']",ppublish,Nihon Rinsho Meneki Gakkai Kaishi. 2008 Jun;31(3):132-40. doi: 10.2177/jsci.31.132.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An assay facilitating early identification of BCR-ABL(T315I) would therefore aid in identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from alternative therapy. This report describes the development of a sensitive T315I mutation detection methodology based on real-time PCR with self-probing fluorescent primers. The technique demonstrated complete concordance with direct sequencing, correctly identifying 34 T315I-positive samples from a total of 61 samples screened. In a limiting dilution assay, the mutated clone was detectable to a level of 1% of total cells.

RESULTS: Of five leukaemic lines examined, p14 was unmethylated in Raji, HL60 and U937, but completely deleted in Jurkat and NB4. DAP kinase was totally methylated in Raji and NB4, but unmethylated in HL60, Jurkat and U937. Apaf-1 was unmethylated in all the lines. At diagnosis, DAP kinase methylation occurred in eight (25%) APL patients and none of the other AML patients (8/32 vs 0/50, p = 0.001). DAP kinase methylation was detected in four (16%) ALL patients. p14 and Apaf-1 methylation was not detected in any of the 32 cases of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL), 50 cases of other subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), and 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two phase II trials, one conducted in pediatric patients and the other in adult patients, were reviewed. Patients were in their first or subsequent relapse and/or were refractory to first-line therapy. The dose and schedule of i.v. nelarabine in the pediatric and adult studies were 650 mg/m2 per day daily for 5 days and 1,500 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1, 3, and 5, respectively. Treatments were repeated every 21 days. Study endpoints were the rates of complete response (CR) and CR with incomplete hematologic or bone marrow recovery (CR*). RESULTS: The pediatric efficacy population consisted of 39 patients who had relapsed after, or had been refractory to, two or more induction regimens. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (13%) and CR+CR* was observed in nine patients (23%). The adult efficacy population consisted of 28 patients. CR to nelarabine treatment was observed in five patients (18%) and CR+CR* was observed in six patients (21%). Neurologic toxicity was dose limiting for both pediatric and adult patients. Other severe toxicities included hematologic, hepatic, and metabolic laboratory abnormalities in pediatric patients and gastrointestinal and pulmonary toxicities in adults. CONCLUSIONS: On October 28, 2005, the FDA granted accelerated approval for nelarabine for treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory T-ALL/T-LBL after at least two prior regimens. This use is based on the induction of CR. The applicant will conduct postmarketing clinical trials to demonstrate clinical benefit, for example, survival prolongation.","['Cohen, Martin H', 'Johnson, John R', 'Justice, Robert', 'Pazdur, Richard']","['Cohen MH', 'Johnson JR', 'Justice R', 'Pazdur R']","['Division of Oncology Drug Products, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Rockville, MD, USA. martin.cohen@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '60158CV180 (nelarabine)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Arabinonucleosides/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Drug Approval/*legislation & jurisprudence', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['13/6/709 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2006-0017 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2008 Jun;13(6):709-14. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2006-0017.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EPO stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt at serine-473 and co-incubation of the Akt/PI-3 kinase pathway inhibitor LY294002 with EPO abolished its effects on Akt phosphorylation and axonal growth. However, while Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) similarly stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, it had no effect on axonal or dendritic growth, indicating that AKT phosphorylation is necessary but not sufficient for neurite outgrowth in hippocampal neurons.","['Ransome, Mark I', 'Turnley, Ann M']","['Ransome MI', 'Turnley AM']","['Neural Regeneration Laboratory, Centre for Neuroscience, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080516,United States,Mol Cell Neurosci,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,9100095,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Axons/*physiology', 'Cell Polarity/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythropoietin/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Models, Neurological', 'Neurons/*cytology/*physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",2008/07/01 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2007/10/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1044-7431(08)00125-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mcn.2008.05.002 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Neurosci. 2008 Aug;38(4):537-47. doi: 10.1016/j.mcn.2008.05.002.

In that respect, 3-hydrogenkwadaphnin (3-HK), a novel daphnane-type diterpene ester from Dendrostellera lessertii (Thymelaeaceae), was found to be an effective inducer of megakaryocytic differentiation in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) K562 cells without any adverse effects on normal cells [Moosavi, M.A., Yazdanparast, R., Sanati, M.H., Nejad, A.S., 2005. 3-Hydrogenkwadaphnin targets inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase and triggers post-G1 arrest apoptosis in human leukemia cell lines. International Journal of Biochemistry and Cell Biology 37, 2366-2379]. In this study, we found that inhibition of cellular replication and maturation, induced by the drug, are dependent upon ERK/MAPK activation. Inhibition of MEK activity by PD98059 reversed the growth arrest, decreased adhesive properties, induction of polyploidization and blocked the expression of GPIIb integrin, induced by 3-HK. Immunoblot analyses also showed that 3-HK-induced sustained activation of ERK1/2 from early exposure times, before the onset of differentiation, up to 96 h. Moreover, our results revealed that cyclin D1 and p21(Cip/WAF1) were increased during differentiation. Consequently, it is concluded that up-regulation of cyclin D1, accompanied by the persistent activation of ERK/MAPK, is involved in the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells under the influence of 3-HK.","['Meshkini, Azadeh', 'Yazdanparast, Razieh']","['Meshkini A', 'Yazdanparast R']","['Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080527,England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,"['0 (3-hydrogenkwadaphnin)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'K562 Cells', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thymelaeaceae/*chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/09 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(08)00133-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tiv.2008.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2008 Sep;22(6):1503-10. doi: 10.1016/j.tiv.2008.05.005.

In acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), fusion proteins involving the transcription factor AML1 and corepressors ETO or MTG16 are recurrently found. We investigated transcriptional repression by the ETO family members ETO and MTG16 with attention to the conserved Nervy Homology Regions (NHRs) and the interacting corepressors human SIN3B (hSIN3B) and N-CoR. Transcriptional repression was examined in a cell line by a GAL4-thymidine kinase luciferase reporter to which the corepressors were tethered through a binding domain. ETO- and MTG16-mediated repression was found to be independent of deletion of the oligomerization NHR2, but deletion of NHR4 and in particular combined deletion of NHR2 and NHR4 lowered the capacity for repression. An interaction was observed between the corepressors hSIN3B and N-CoR and these two proteins cooperated for transcriptional repression independent of co-transfected ETO and MTG16. Transcriptional repression mediated by ETO and MTG16 was only slightly strengthened by coexpression of hSIN3B or N-CoR and was dependent on HDAC activity. Our data indicate that ETO family member-mediated oligomerization and repression can be distinct events and that interaction between ETO family members and hSIN3B or N-CoR may not necessarily strengthen transcriptional repression.","['Olsson, Andre', 'Olsson, Inge', 'Dhanda, Rakesh Singh']","['Olsson A', 'Olsson I', 'Dhanda RS']","['Department of Hematology, BMC, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080610,Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (CBFA2T2 myeloid-transforming gene-related protein)', '0 (CBFA2T3 protein, human)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3B protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Dimerization', 'Down-Regulation', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Multigene Family/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Transgenes', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2008/07/01 09:00,2009/01/08 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2007/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1874-9399(08)00120-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2008 Oct;1779(10):590-8. doi: 10.1016/j.bbagrm.2008.06.001.

Under conditions of high B cell burden, exhaustion of the body's effector mechanisms, for example, NK-cell-mediated killing, may lead to substantial decreases in the immunotherapeutic efficacy of this mAb. Moreover, RTX treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high levels of circulating B cells can lead to removal of CD20 from the cells, thus allowing them to persist and resist clearance. RTX therapy for several autoimmune diseases has proven to be effective, but in numerous instances there has been little correlation between reductions in disease activity and changes in titers of pathogenic autoantibodies. This paradox may be explained by a separate mechanism: Binding of RTX to B cells generates immune complexes that act as decoys to attract monoycte/macrophages and thus reduce their inflammatory activity in certain autoantibody-mediated diseases. Several second-generation anti-CD20 mAbs with enhanced cytotoxic action have been developed and are being tested in the clinic for treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases. The application of these mAbs, potentially in combination with immune effector modifying drugs, may successfully address the shortcomings of current anti-CD20 immunotherapy.","['Taylor, Ronald P', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A']","['Taylor RP', 'Lindorfer MA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA. rpt@virginia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20080701,England,Curr Opin Immunol,Current opinion in immunology,8900118,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology/metabolism', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Rituximab']",2008/07/01 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0952-7915(08)00090-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.coi.2008.05.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Opin Immunol. 2008 Aug;20(4):444-9. doi: 10.1016/j.coi.2008.05.011.

Inhalation of butter flavoring vapors was first associated with clinical bronchiolitis obliterans among workers in microwave popcorn production. Recent findings have shown irreversible obstructive lung disease among workers not only in the microwave popcorn industry, but also in flavoring manufacture, and in chemical synthesis of diacetyl, a predominant chemical for butter flavoring. It has been reported that perfluorochemicals utilized in food packaging are migrating into foods and may be sources of oral exposure. Relatively small quantities of perfluorochemicals are used in the manufacturing of paper or paperboard that is in direct contact with food to repel oil or grease and water. Because of recent concerns about perfluorochemicals such as those found on microwave popcorn bags (e.g. Lodyne P208E) and diacetyl in foods, we evaluated both compounds for mutagenicity using the mammalian cell gene mutation assay in L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells. Lodyne P208E was less toxic than diacetyl and did not induce a mutagenic response. Diacetyl induced a highly mutagenic response in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma mutation assay in the presence of human liver S9 for activation. The increase in the frequency of small colonies in the assay with diacetyl indicates that diacetyl causes damage to multiple loci on chromosome 11 in addition to functional loss of the thymidine kinase locus.","['Whittaker, Paul', 'Clarke, Jane J', 'San, Richard H C', 'Begley, Timothy H', 'Dunkel, Virginia C']","['Whittaker P', 'Clarke JJ', 'San RH', 'Begley TH', 'Dunkel VC']","['Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, HFS-717, College Park, MD 20740-3835, United States. paul.whittaker@fda.hhs.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080610,England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane)', '0 (Flavoring Agents)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated)', '0 (Lodyne P208E)', '0 (Mutagens)', '8029-34-3 (Butter)', 'K324J5K4HM (Diacetyl)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Butter', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chlorofluorocarbons, Methane/*toxicity', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Diacetyl/*toxicity', 'Flavoring Agents/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated/*toxicity', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Liver/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Mutagens', 'Paper', 'Point Mutation/drug effects', 'Translocation, Genetic/drug effects']",2008/07/01 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/07/01 09:00'],"['2008/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/01 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0278-6915(08)00287-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fct.2008.06.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 2008 Aug;46(8):2928-33. doi: 10.1016/j.fct.2008.06.001.

For this reason, flow cytometry has been an effective tool for single-cell analysis of properties using light scattering and fluorescence labeling. However, conventional flow cytometry cannot measure cell mechanical properties, alterations of which contribute to the pathophysiology of hematologic diseases such as sepsis, diabetic retinopathy, and sickle cell anemia. Here we present a high-throughput microfluidics-based 'biophysical' flow cytometry technique that measures single-cell transit times of blood cell populations passing through in vitro capillary networks. To demonstrate clinical relevance, we use this technique to characterize biophysical changes in two model disease states in which mechanical properties of cells are thought to lead to microvascular obstruction: (i) sepsis, a process in which inflammatory mediators in the bloodstream activate neutrophils and (ii) leukostasis, an often fatal and poorly understood complication of acute leukemia. Using patient samples, we show that cell transit time through and occlusion of microfluidic channels is increased for both disease states compared to control samples, and we find that mechanical heterogeneity of blood cell populations is a better predictor of microvascular obstruction than average properties. Inflammatory mediators involved in sepsis were observed to significantly affect the shape and magnitude of the neutrophil transit time population distribution. Altered properties of leukemia cell subpopulations, rather than of the population as a whole, were found to correlate with symptoms of leukostasis in patients-a new result that may be useful for guiding leukemia therapy. By treating cells with drugs that affect the cytoskeleton, we also demonstrate that their transit times could be significantly reduced. Biophysical flow cytometry offers a low-cost and high-throughput diagnostic and drug discovery platform for hematologic diseases that affect microcirculatory flow.","['Rosenbluth, Michael J', 'Lam, Wilbur A', 'Fletcher, Daniel A']","['Rosenbluth MJ', 'Lam WA', 'Fletcher DA']","['Department of Bioengineering, 608B Stanley Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-3220, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080605,England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,['0 (Inflammation Mediators)'],IM,"['Biomechanical Phenomena', 'Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Size/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry/*instrumentation', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/complications/pathology', 'Leukostasis/complications/pathology', 'Microfluidic Analytical Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Sepsis/pathology', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/28 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/06/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b802931h [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2008 Jul;8(7):1062-70. doi: 10.1039/b802931h.

However, here we demonstrate that, contrary to expectations, Bcl10 is differentially required for T cell activation, including for both proliferation and cytokine production. When CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were divided based on expression levels of CD44, which distinguishes naive cells (CD44lo) versus those that are antigen-experienced (CD44hi), IL2 production by and proliferation of CD4+CD44lo naive cells and both subpopulations of CD8+ T cells were clearly Bcl10-dependent, whereas these same functional properties of CD4+CD44hi T cells occurred largely independent of Bcl10. As with the other subpopulations of T cells, CD4+CD44hi T cells did not activate the NF-kappaB pathway in the absence of Bcl10; nevertheless, these CD4+CD44hi antigen-experienced T cells efficiently secreted IL2 after T cell receptor stimulation. Strikingly, therefore, T cell receptor-mediated IL2 production in these cells is NF-kappaB-independent. Our studies suggest that antigen-experienced CD4+ T cells differ from their naive counterparts and from CD8+ T cells in their ability to achieve activation independent of the Bcl10/NF-kappaB pathway.","['Zeng, Hu', 'Chen, Yuhong', 'Yu, Mei', 'Xue, Liquan', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Morris, Stephan W', 'Wang, Demin', 'Wen, Renren']","['Zeng H', 'Chen Y', 'Yu M', 'Xue L', 'Gao X', 'Morris SW', 'Wang D', 'Wen R']","['Model Animal Research Center, State Key Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Nanjing University, Nanjing 225001, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080625,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein)', '0 (Bcl10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cd44 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics/*immunology', 'Animals', 'B-Cell CLL-Lymphoma 10 Protein', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/genetics/*immunology', '*Immunologic Memory/genetics', 'Interleukin-12/genetics/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-kappa B/genetics/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell']",2008/06/28 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/06/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49182-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M802344200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Sep 5;283(36):24392-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M802344200.

METHODS: HLA-A, B, and DRB1 alleles were genotyped in 105 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia, 25 with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and 48 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia using polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primer (PCR-SSP). The hemopoietic stem cells from 3,664 unrelated normal individuals of Han nationality in Hunan were used as the control group. RESULTS: The phenotypic frequencies of HLA-B58, DR12, and DR14 were significantly higher in patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia than in the control group, with relative risk of 6.1287, 1.6519, and 1.6479, respectively. In patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, the phenotypic frequency of HLA-B58 was significantly higher than that in the control group, with the relative risk of 7.4055. In patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, the frequencies of HLA-B58 and DR8 phenotypes were significantly higher but HLA-A24 frequency was significantly lower than those of the control group, with the relative risk of 13.9789, 2.2839, and 0.4012, respectively. CONCLUSION: HLA-B58, DR12, DR14 alleles appear to contribute to the genetic susceptibility of patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia. HLA-B58 allele can be associated with the genetic susceptibility for patients with acute lymphocytic leukaemia. In patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, HLA-B58 and DR8 are probably the susceptible alleles whereas HLA-A24 allele may play a protective role.","['Luo, Qi-Zhi', 'Li, Li-Xin', 'Xie, Yu-Bin', 'Yan, Mei-Yu', 'Yu, Ping']","['Luo QZ', 'Li LX', 'Xie YB', 'Yan MY', 'Yu P']","['Department of Immunology, Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University, Changsha 410008, China. luoqz1025@163.com']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (RBM45 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Asians/genetics', 'China', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'HLA-A Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/ethnology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/ethnology/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/ethnology/genetics', 'Male', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/ethnology/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics']",2008/06/28 09:00,2009/04/03 09:00,['2008/06/28 09:00'],"['2008/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2008 Jun;28(6):1016-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the validity of and the factors influencing these estimates. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We explored physicians' prognostic estimates (six-point scale from very good to very poor) in a sample of 136 patients participating in a psycho-oncology study. Patients (mean age, 41 years) were followed-up for at least 2 years, and 72 patients died during the follow-up period. RESULTS: Physicians' estimates were clearly associated with overall survival (univariate Cox regression: hazard ratio=1.51, 95% confidence interval=1.24-1.82). In a multivariate Cox regression model, these estimates were independent predictors for survival in addition to previous treatment (former HSCT) and donor type (related vs. unrelated). DISCUSSION: Physicians on transplant units are able to give a concise prognostic estimate that corresponds to real outcomes. Patients often do not have a sufficient understanding of the risks of their treatment. Obtaining such condensed information instead of a complex prognostic estimate might be easier to understand. For the physician, it might be helpful to reflect his/her individual method of condensing information to be able to give a concise prognosis and to achieve informed consent with the patient. A systematic description of the extensive implicit and explicit experiences regarding objective and subjective data and its respective weight could help to improve the training of future hematologists and should be explored in further studies.","['Grulke, Norbert', 'Bunjes, Donald', 'Larbig, Wolfgang', 'Kachele, Horst', 'Bailer, Harald']","['Grulke N', 'Bunjes D', 'Larbig W', 'Kachele H', 'Bailer H']","['University of Ulm, Psychosomatic Medicine, Ulm, Germany. norbert.grulke@uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080604,England,J Psychosom Res,Journal of psychosomatic research,0376333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Attitude of Health Personnel', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Informed Consent', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Physicians/psychology/standards/*statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Transplantation Conditioning/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/28 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/06/28 09:00'],"['2007/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2007/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/01/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/28 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3999(08)00041-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.01.008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Psychosom Res. 2008 Jul;65(1):61-6. doi: 10.1016/j.jpsychores.2008.01.008.

These results were the impulse to examine Polygonum amphibium L. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the isolation of active components from methanol extract and the determination of their cytotoxic effect on human leukaemic cell lines. METHODOLOGY: Three flavonoid components from butanol soluble fractions of methanol extract by CC and PC preparative chromatography were isolated. Their structures were established on the basis of 1H, 13C and correlation (DEPT, H-H, COSY, HMQC, HMBC) NMR, UV and FAB-MS spectroscopic techniques. The evaluation of the anti-leukaemic activities of 1 and 2 against Jurkat and HL60 cell lines was carried out in vitro using annexin V fluorescence assay. RESULTS: Two new flavonoid glucuronides, quercetin-3-O-beta-glucuronide (1) and quercetin-3-O-alpha-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-glucuronide (2), and kaempferol-3-O-alpha-rhamnosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-glucuronide (3), were isolated from Polygonum amphibium L. It was demonstrated that the glucuronides of quercetin are able to induce apoptosis in the tested human leukaemic cells.

Recently, the International Staging System (ISS), including beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) and albumin, was introduced for patients with symptomatic MM. As bone disease is a hallmark of MM, we investigated the prognostic impact of the bone resorption marker carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type-1 collagen (ICTP) in combination with ISS, beta2M, albumin, deletion of chromosome 13 and high-dose therapy (HDT) in 100 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic MM. beta2M alone, albumin alone, ISS, HDT, del(13q14) and ICTP were significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). In a multivariate analysis, ICTP was the most powerful prognostic factor (log-rank P<0.001, hazard ratio: ninefold increase). ICTP clearly separated two subgroups with a good and a worse prognosis within each of the three ISS stages (ISS I: P=0.027, ISS II: P=0.022, ISS III: P=0.013). Incorporation of ICTP in a combined ICTP-ISS score significantly (P<0.001) separated four risk groups with a 5-year OS rate of 95, 64, 46 and 22%, [corrected] respectively. These data demonstrate for the first time that the inclusion of the collagen-I degradation product ICTP, as a biomarker of bone resorption, adds to the prognostic value of ISS.","['Jakob, C', 'Sterz, J', 'Liebisch, P', 'Mieth, M', 'Rademacher, J', 'Goerke, A', 'Heider, U', 'Fleissner, C', 'Kaiser, M', 'von Metzler, I', 'Muller, C', 'Sezer, O']","['Jakob C', 'Sterz J', 'Liebisch P', 'Mieth M', 'Rademacher J', 'Goerke A', 'Heider U', 'Fleissner C', 'Kaiser M', 'von Metzler I', 'Muller C', 'Sezer O']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20080626,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Collagen Type I)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Bone Resorption/diagnosis', 'Collagen Type I/*analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods/standards', 'Peptides/analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008159 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.159 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1767-72. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.159.

Modern molecularly targeted cancer drugs intervene in cell signaling compensating for pathway deregulation. Hence characterizing tumors with respect to pathway activation will become crucial for treatment decisions. Here we have used semi-supervised machine learning methodology to generate signatures of eight oncogene-inducible pathways, which are conserved across epithelial and lymphoid tissues. We combined them to patterns of pathway activity called PAPs for pathway activation patterns and searched for them in 220 morphologically, immunohistochemically and genetically well-characterized mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas including 134 cases with clinical data available. Besides Burkitt lymphoma, which was characterized by a unique pattern, the PAPs identified four distinct groups of mature aggressive B-cell lymphomas across independent gene expression studies with distinct biological characteristics, genetic aberrations and prognosis.

We found that although IRF8 was detectable in most reactive B-cells, its expression levels differed with developmental stage. Germinal center B cells contained the highest levels of IRF8, with lower levels seen in mantle and marginal zone B cells and none in plasma cells. IRF8 was coexpressed with PAX-5, Pu.1, and B-cell lymphoma (BCL)-6, and similar to BCL-6, was absent from the small population of IRF4-positive germinal center B cells thought to be committed to postgerminal center developmental programs. Similarly, IRF8 was most strongly expressed in lymphomas of germinal center origin with lower levels present in mantle cell lymphomas, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and marginal zone lymphomas, and no expression observed in plasmacytic/plasmablastic neoplasms. The reciprocal expression pattern with IRF4 in reactive tissues was generally maintained in lymphomas with some exceptions. These results suggest an important role for IRF8 during germinal center B-cell development and in related lymphomas, and provide a new diagnostic marker helpful in distinguishing B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes.","['Martinez, Antonio', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Rudelius, Martina', 'Davies-Hill, Theresa', 'Sebasigari, Denise', 'Fountaine, Thomas J', 'Hewitt, Stephen', 'Jaffe, Elaine S', 'Raffeld, Mark']","['Martinez A', 'Pittaluga S', 'Rudelius M', 'Davies-Hill T', 'Sebasigari D', 'Fountaine TJ', 'Hewitt S', 'Jaffe ES', 'Raffeld M']","['Hematopathology Section, Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",,United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Germinal Center/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/metabolism', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Palatine Tonsil/chemistry', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/08/15 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/PAS.0b013e318166f46a [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 2008 Aug;32(8):1190-200. doi: 10.1097/PAS.0b013e318166f46a.,,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the blood expression of Granzyme B (GB) and Perforin (PF) in the following pathological conditions after intestinal transplantation: acute rejection (AR), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The diagnostic accuracy and the clinical utility of these tests are finally discussed. METHODS: GB and PF levels were measured by real time polymerase chain reaction on peripheral blood samples from 32 intestinal recipients. Blood samples (n=494) after comparison of clinical, histological, and microbiological data were assigned to the following groups: normal (n=307), AR (n=30), EBV infection (n=107), CMV infection (n=25), and PTLD (n=25). RESULTS: Mean levels of GB and PF in the AR (GB=279.7; PF=256.7), PTLD (GB=199; PF=185.9), EBV (GB=133.2; PF=143.7), and CMV (GB=151.3; PF=144) groups were significantly higher than in the normal group (GB=100.1; PF=101.1) (all P<0.05, except for PF in CMV infection). The best accuracy was obtained for the diagnosis of AR with sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 79% for GB and 70% and 79% for PF, respectively.

GB and PF blood levels are also increased in case of viral infections or PTLD.

This is because the histology is not always classical, and despite having a characteristic phenotype, there are few relevant monoclonal antibodies with sufficient sensitivity and specificity that can be applied to fixed material. In this study, we assessed the utility of a newly developed antibody against a formalin-resistant CD11c epitope (5D11) for the diagnosis and monitoring of HCL in formalin-fixed tissue. METHODS: We performed immunohistochemical staining for CD11c expression in formalin-fixed and also decalcified tissue of 196 small B-cell lymphomas, including 104 cases of HCL showing extensive to minimal infiltrates. RESULTS: The CD11c antibody was both sensitive and specific for HCL, even in cases with minimal infiltration. CONCLUSION: We recommend that this CD11c antibody be added to a panel of antibodies for immunostaining of formalin-fixed material, for differentiation of HCL from other small B-cell lymphomas, and for detection of residual disease following therapy.","['Johrens, Korinna', 'Happerfield, Lisa C', 'Brown, John P', 'Erber, Wendy N', 'Stein, Harald', 'Anagnostopoulos, Ioannis']","['Johrens K', 'Happerfield LC', 'Brown JP', 'Erber WN', 'Stein H', 'Anagnostopoulos I']","['Institute of Pathology and Reference Center for Hematopathology, Charite, Medical University Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080626,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD11c Antigen)', '0 (Fixatives)', '1HG84L3525 (Formaldehyde)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'CD11c Antigen/immunology/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fixatives', 'Formaldehyde', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2007/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['000132386 [pii]', '10.1159/000132386 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2008;75(4):252-6. doi: 10.1159/000132386.

The process involves a proliferative phase during which highly viable primary transformants expand, followed by a period of marked apoptosis (called ""crisis"") that is dependent on the presence of p19(Arf) and p53; rare cells that survive this phase emerge as fully transformed and malignant. To understand the way in which v-Abl expression affects p19(Arf) expression, we examined changes in expression of Arf during all stages of Ab-MLV transformation process. As is consistent with the ability of v-Abl to stimulate Myc, a transcription factor known to induce p19(Arf), Myc and Arf are induced soon after infection and p19(Arf) is expressed. At these early time points, the infected cells remain highly viable. The onset of crisis is marked by an increase in p19(Arf) expression and a change in localization of the protein from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus. These data together suggest that the localization and expression levels of p19(Arf) modulate the effects of the protein during oncogenesis and reveal that the p19(Arf)-mediated response is subject to multiple layers of regulation that influence its function during Ab-MLV-mediated transformation.","['Zimmerman, Rebekah Stackpole', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Zimmerman RS', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Pathology, Genetics Graduate Program, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080625,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Indoles)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology/*virology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Heterozygote', 'Indoles/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00348-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00348-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Sep;82(17):8383-91. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00348-08.

Oncolytic viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), have emerged as potential anticancer agents that selectively target and kill malignant cells via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Although primary CLL cells are largely resistant to VSV oncolysis, we postulated that targeting the apoptotic pathway via inhibition of BCL-2 may sensitize CLL cells to VSV oncolysis. In the present study, we examined the capacity of EM20-25--a small-molecule antagonist of the BCL-2 protein--to overcome CLL resistance to VSV oncolysis. We demonstrate a synergistic effect of the two agents in primary ex vivo CLL cells (combination index of 0.5; P < 0.0001). In a direct comparison of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers with primary CLL, the two agents combined showed a therapeutic index of 19-fold; furthermore, the combination of VSV and EM20-25 increased apoptotic cell death in Karpas-422 and Granta-519 B-lymphoma cell lines (P < 0.005) via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. Mechanistically, EM20-25 blocked the ability of the BCL-2 protein to dimerize with proapoptotic BAX protein, thus sensitizing CLL to VSV oncolytic stress. Together, these data indicate that the use of BCL-2 inhibitors may improve VSV oncolysis in treatment-resistant hematological malignancies, such as CLL, with characterized defects in the apoptotic response.","['Tumilasci, Vanessa Fonseca', 'Oliere, Stephanie', 'Nguyen, Thi Lien-Ahn', 'Shamy, April', 'Bell, John', 'Hiscott, John']","['Tumilasci VF', 'Oliere S', 'Nguyen TL', 'Shamy A', 'Bell J', 'Hiscott J']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Molecular Oncology Group, Lady Davis Institute-Jewish General Hospital, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080625,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0', '(5-(6-chloro-2,4-dioxo-1,3,4,10-tetrahydro-2H-9-oxa-1,3-diazaanthracen-10-yl)pyri', 'midine-2,4,6-trione)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Barbiturates)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Formazans)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '23305-68-2 (MTT formazan)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Barbiturates/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzopyrans/chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Caspases/analysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Formazans/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Male', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Structure', '*Oncolytic Virotherapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tetrazolium Salts/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus/*physiology']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00851-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00851-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Sep;82(17):8487-99. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00851-08.

ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 exhibits a plaque-forming defect of up to 3 orders of magnitude in HFs, whereas in many other cell types, this defect varies between 10- and 30-fold. The reasons for the high ICP0 requirement for HSV-1 infection in HFs have not been established definitively. Previous studies using other cell types suggested that ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 is hypersensitive to interferon and that this sensitivity is dependent on the cellular promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein. To investigate the roles of two important aspects of interferon signaling in the phenotype of ICP0-null mutant HSV-1, we isolated HFs depleted of STAT-1 or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3). Surprisingly, plaque formation by the mutant virus was not improved in either cell type. We found that the sensitivity to interferon pretreatment of both ICP0-null mutant and wild-type (wt) HSV-1 was highly dependent on the multiplicity of infection. At a low multiplicity in virus yield experiments, both viruses were extremely susceptible to interferon pretreatment of HFs, but the sensitivity of the wild type but not the mutant could be overcome at higher multiplicities. We found that both wt and ICP0-null mutant HSV-1 remained sensitive to interferon in PML-depleted HFs albeit to an apparently lesser extent than in control cells. The data imply that the substantial reduction in ICP0-null HSV-1 infectivity at a low multiplicity in HFs does not occur through the activities of STAT-1- and IRF-3-dependent pathways and cannot be explained solely by enhanced sensitivity to interferon. We suggest that antiviral activities induced by interferon may be separable from and additive to those resulting from PML-related intrinsic resistance mechanisms.","['Everett, Roger D', 'Young, Dan F', 'Randall, Rick E', 'Orr, Anne']","['Everett RD', 'Young DF', 'Randall RE', 'Orr A']","['MRC Virology Unit, Institute of Virology, Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom. r.everett@mrcvu.gla.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080625,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Vmw110 protein, Human herpesvirus 1)']",IM,"['Fibroblasts/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/*metabolism', 'Interferons/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics/*physiology']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00613-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00613-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Sep;82(17):8871-81. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00613-08.

PUMA also mediates apoptosis independent of p53. In this study, we investigated the role and mechanism of PUMA induction in response to serum starvation in p53-deficient cancer cells. Following serum starvation, the binding of Sp1 to the PUMA promoter significantly increased, whereas inhibition of Sp1 completely abrogated PUMA induction. p73 was found to be upregulated by serum starvation and mediate PUMA induction through the p53-binding sites in the PUMA promoter. Sp1 and p73beta appeared to cooperatively activate PUMA transcription, which is inhibited by the phosphoinsitide 3-kinase (PI3K)-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of PUMA suppressed serum starvation-induced apoptosis in leukemia cells.

LEF-1 and TCF-1 are also expressed in mature peripheral primary T cells, but their expression is down-regulated following T cell activation. Although the decisive roles of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in the early stages of T cell development are well documented, the functions of these factors in mature peripheral T cells are largely unknown. Recently, LEF-1 was shown to suppress Th2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4), -5, and -13 expression from the developing Th2 cells that overexpress LEF-1 through retrovirus gene transduction. In this study, we further investigated the expression and functions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in peripheral CD4+ T cells and revealed that LEF-1 is dominantly expressed in Th1 but not in Th2 cells. We identified a high affinity LEF-1-binding site in the negative regulatory element of the IL-4 promoter. Knockdown LEF-1 expression by LEF-1-specific small interfering RNA resulted in an increase in the IL-4 mRNA expression. This study further confirms a negative regulatory role of LEF-1 in mature peripheral T cells. Furthermore, we found that IL-4 stimulation possesses a negative effect on the expressions of LEF-1 and TCF-1 in primary T cells, suggesting a positive feedback effect of IL-4 on IL4 gene expression.","['Hebenstreit, Daniel', 'Giaisi, Marco', 'Treiber, Monika K', 'Zhang, Xiao-Bin', 'Mi, Huai-Feng', 'Horejs-Hoeck, Jutta', 'Andersen, Kristian G', 'Krammer, Peter H', 'Duschl, Albert', 'Li-Weber, Min']","['Hebenstreit D', 'Giaisi M', 'Treiber MK', 'Zhang XB', 'Mi HF', 'Horejs-Hoeck J', 'Andersen KG', 'Krammer PH', 'Duschl A', 'Li-Weber M']","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Salzburg, 5020 Salzburg, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080625,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Lef1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Ribonucleic Acid/*genetics']",2008/06/27 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/06/27 09:00'],"['2008/06/27 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/27 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)74781-2 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804096200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 15;283(33):22490-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M804096200.

We generated mouse models designed to test this possibility directly, and we found that both the constitutive and antigen-stimulated state of a clonal BCR affected the rate and outcome of lymphomagenesis initiated by the proto-oncogene MYC. The tumors that arose in the presence of constitutive BCR differed from those initiated by MYC alone and resembled chronic B cell lymphocytic leukemia/lymphoma (B-CLL), whereas those that arose in response to antigen stimulation resembled large B-cell lymphomas, particularly Burkitt lymphoma (BL). We linked the genesis of the BL-like tumors to antigen stimulus in three ways. First, in reconstruction experiments, stimulation of B cells by an autoantigen in the presence of overexpressed MYC gave rise to BL-like tumors that were, in turn, dependent on both MYC and the antigen for survival and proliferation. Second, genetic disruption of the pathway that mediates signaling from the BCR promptly killed cells of the BL-like tumors as well as the tumors resembling B-CLL. And third, growth of the murine BL could be inhibited by any of three distinctive immunosuppressants, in accord with the dependence of the tumors on antigen-induced signaling. Together, our results provide direct evidence that antigenic stimulation can participate in lymphomagenesis, point to a potential role for the constitutive BCR as well, and sustain the view that the constitutive BCR gives rise to signals different from those elicited by antigen. The mouse models described here should be useful in exploring further the pathogenesis of lymphomas, and in preclinical testing of new therapeutics.","['Refaeli, Yosef', 'Young, Ryan M', 'Turner, Brian C', 'Duda, Jennifer', 'Field, Kenneth A', 'Bishop, J Michael']","['Refaeli Y', 'Young RM', 'Turner BC', 'Duda J', 'Field KA', 'Bishop JM']","['The George W.

In this study, we report for the first time a systematic analysis of 198 avian sarcoma leukosis virus (ASLV) insertion sites identified in rhesus long-term repopulating cells, and a comparison of ASLV insertion patterns to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV) (n = 396) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) (n = 289) using the newly released rhesus genome databank. Despite a weak preference toward gene-coding regions, ASLV integration is nonclustered, does not favor gene-rich regions, transcription start sites, or CpG islands. There was no propensity for ASLV insertions within or near proto-oncogenes, and most importantly, no insertions close to or within the Mds1-Evi1 locus, which is in contrast to the significant over-representation of this insertion site for MLV vectors in the same transplantation model. Furthermore, ASLV long terminal repeats (LTRs) do not have detectable promoter and enhancer activity in a quantitative luciferase assay to measure neighboring gene activation. The combination of these features is unique for ASLV and suggests that optimized vectors based on this virus could be useful and safe for gene transfer to hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells.","['Hu, Jingqiong', 'Renaud, Gabriel', 'Gomes, Theotonius J', 'Ferris, Andrea', 'Hendrie, Paul C', 'Donahue, Robert E', 'Hughes, Stephen H', 'Wolfsberg, Tyra G', 'Russell, David W', 'Dunbar, Cynthia E']","['Hu J', 'Renaud G', 'Gomes TJ', 'Ferris A', 'Hendrie PC', 'Donahue RE', 'Hughes SH', 'Wolfsberg TG', 'Russell DW', 'Dunbar CE']","['Molecular Hematopoiesis Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080624,United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,"['0 (MDS1-EVI1 fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*genetics', 'Chickens', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Macaca mulatta/genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Transcription Initiation Site', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transduction, Genetic', '*Virus Integration']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/11/19 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(16)32060-3 [pii]', '10.1038/mt.2008.135 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2008 Sep;16(9):1617-23. doi: 10.1038/mt.2008.135.

BCR-ABL mutations are associated with failure of imatinib treatment in many CML patients. LYN kinase regulates survival and responsiveness of CML cells to inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase, and differences in LYN regulation have been found between imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cell lines. METHODS: We evaluated cells from 12 imatinib-resistant CML patients with mutation-negative BCR-ABL and from six imatinib-sensitive patients who discontinued therapy because of imatinib intolerance. Phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and LYN was assessed in patient cells and cell lines by immunoblotting with activation state-specific antibodies, co-immunoprecipitation studies, and mass spectroscopy analysis of phosphopeptides. Cell viability, caspase activation, and apoptosis were also measured. Mutations were analyzed by sequencing. The effect of silencing LYN with short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or reducing activation by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors was evaluated in cell lines and patient cells. RESULTS: Imatinib treatment suppressed LYN phosphorylation in cells from imatinib-sensitive CML patients and imatinib-sensitive cell lines. Imatinib treatment blocked BCR-ABL signaling but did not suppress LYN phosphorylation in cells from imatinib-resistant patients, and persistent activation of LYN kinase was not associated with mutations in LYN kinase or its carboxyl-terminal regulatory domains. Unique LYN phosphorylation sites (tyrosine-193 and tyrosine-459) and associated proteins (c-Cbl and p80) were identified in cells from imatinib-resistant patients. Reducing LYN expression (siRNA) or activation (dasatinib) was associated with loss of cell survival and cytogenetic or complete hematologic responses in imatinib-resistant disease. CONCLUSIONS: LYN activation was independent of BCR-ABL in cells from imatinib-resistant patients. Thus, LYN kinase may be involved in imatinib resistance in CML patients with mutation-negative BCR-ABL and its direct inhibition is consistent with clinical responses in these patients.","['Wu, Ji', 'Meng, Feng', 'Kong, Ling-Yuan', 'Peng, Zhenghong', 'Ying, Yunming', 'Bornmann, William G', 'Darnay, Bryant G', 'Lamothe, Betty', 'Sun, Hanshi', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Wu J', 'Meng F', 'Kong LY', 'Peng Z', 'Ying Y', 'Bornmann WG', 'Darnay BG', 'Lamothe B', 'Sun H', 'Talpaz M', 'Donato NJ']","['Departments of Experimental Therapeutics, The M.

Multivariable analysis revealed that ZAP-70 was the strongest risk factor. Knowledge of the IGHV mutation status or CD38 did not improve our ability to predict the time to first treatment except for ZAP-70-negative cases, which could be segregated into 2 groups of intermediate-risk or low-risk disease based on whether they expressed unmutated or mutated IGHV. ZAP-70 maintained its high relative prognostic value for the subset of patients with early-stage, asymptomatic disease, including patients evaluated within 1 year of diagnosis. Although it is premature to recommend therapy based on these risk factors, patients with ZAP-70-positive CLL cells should be monitored closely for disease progression as they have a median time from diagnosis to requiring initial therapy by standard criteria of approximately 3 years.","['Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Jain, Sonia', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Wierda, William G', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Gribben, John G', 'Neuberg, Donna S', 'He, Feng', 'Greaves, Andrew W', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Rassenti LZ', 'Jain S', 'Keating MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC', 'Kay NE', 'Brown JR', 'Gribben JG', 'Neuberg DS', 'He F', 'Greaves AW', 'Rai KR', 'Kipps TJ']","['The Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Research Consortium, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080624,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49627-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-05-092882 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1923-30. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-05-092882.

Recognition of beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) by aPL antibodies appears to play a major role in the disease process. We therefore used the techniques of ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate whether HCQ directly affects the formation of aPL IgG-beta2GPI complexes on phospholipid bilayers. HCQ, at concentrations of 1 mug/mL and greater, significantly reduced the binding of aPL-beta2GPI complexes to phospholipid surfaces and THP-1 (human acute monocytic leukemia cell line) monocytes. The drug also reduced the binding of the individual proteins to bilayers. This HCQ-mediated reduction of binding was completely reversed when the HCQ-protein solutions were dialyzed against buffer. HCQ also caused modest, but statistically significant, reductions of clinical antiphospholipid assays. In conclusion, HCQ reduces the formation of aPL-beta2GPI complexes to phospholipid bilayers and cells. This effect appears to be due to reversible interactions between HCQ and the proteins and may contribute to the observed reduction of thrombosis in human and experimental APS. These results support the possibility that HCQ, or analogous molecules, may offer novel nonanticoagulant therapeutic strategies for treating APS.","['Rand, Jacob H', 'Wu, Xiao-Xuan', 'Quinn, Anthony S', 'Chen, Pojen P', 'Hathcock, James J', 'Taatjes, Douglas J']","['Rand JH', 'Wu XX', 'Quinn AS', 'Chen PP', 'Hathcock JJ', 'Taatjes DJ']","['Department of Pathology, Montefiore Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY, USA. jrand@montefiore.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080624,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Antiphospholipid)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (Multiprotein Complexes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (beta 2-Glycoprotein I)', '4QWG6N8QKH (Hydroxychloroquine)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Antiphospholipid/blood/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antimalarials/pharmacology', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/blood/drug therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hydroxychloroquine/*pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Atomic Force', 'Multiprotein Complexes/chemistry/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'beta 2-Glycoprotein I/chemistry/*metabolism']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49601-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-144204 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1687-95. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-03-144204.

Here, we report that the novel AKT inhibitor (2S)-1-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-[5-(3-methyl-2H-indazol-5-yl)pyridin-3-yl]oxypropan2-ami ne (A443654) leads to rapid cell death of T-ALL lines and patient samples. Treatment of CEM, Jurkat, and MOLT-4 cells with nanomolar doses of the inhibitor led to AKT phosphorylation accompanied by dephosphorylation and activation of the downstream target, glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. Effects were time- and dose-dependent, resulting in apoptotic cell death. Treatment of Jurkat cells with A443654 resulted in activation of caspase-2, -3, -6, -8, and -9. Apoptotic cell death was mostly dependent on caspase-2 activation, as demonstrated by preincubation with a selective pharmacological inhibitor. It is remarkable that A443654 was highly effective against the drug-resistant cell line CEM-VBL100, which expresses 170-kDa P-glycoprotein. Moreover, A443654 synergized with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide in both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant cell lines when coadministered [combination index (CI) = 0.39] or when pretreated with etoposide followed by A443654 (CI = 0.689). The efficacy of A443654 was confirmed using blasts from six patients with T-ALL, all of whom displayed low levels of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and constitutive phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473. At 1 microM, the inhibitor was able to induce apoptotic cell death of T-ALL blast cells, as indicated by flow cytometric analysis of samples immunostained for active (cleaved) caspase-3. Because activated AKT is seen in a large percentage of patients with T-ALL, A443654, either alone or in combination with existing drugs, may be a useful therapy for primary and drug-resistant T-ALL.","['Fala, Federica', 'Blalock, William L', 'Tazzari, Pier Luigi', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Martelli, Alberto M']","['Fala F', 'Blalock WL', 'Tazzari PL', 'Cappellini A', 'Chiarini F', 'Martinelli G', 'Tafuri A', 'McCubrey JA', 'Cocco L', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Human Anatomical Sciences, University of Bologna, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080624,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (A 443654)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (Indoles)', '1114-81-4 (Phosphothreonine)', '17885-08-4 (Phosphoserine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (GSK3B protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.26 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3/metabolism', 'Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/*pharmacology', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phosphoserine/metabolism', 'Phosphothreonine/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.108.047639 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.108.047639 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;74(3):884-95. doi: 10.1124/mol.108.047639.

These hormones are important in controlling blood glucose homeostasis, intestinal cell proliferation, and satiety. More importantly, the major hormone generated in the pancreas (i.e. glucagon) exerts opposite effects to the ones that are produced in the intestines (i.e. glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GLP-2). To understand the mechanisms underlying cell-type-specific gcg expression may lead to the identification of novel drug targets to control endogenous hormone production for therapeutic purposes. Extensive in vitro examinations have shown that more than a half dozen of homeodomain (HD) proteins are able to interact with the gcg gene promoter and activate its expression. In vivo 'knock-out' mouse studies, however, cannot demonstrate the role of some of them (i.e. Cdx-2, Brn-4, and Nkx6.2) in the development of pancreatic islet alpha-cells, suggesting that these HD proteins may exert some redundant functions in the genesis of gcg-producing cells. Investigations have also revealed that gcg expression is controlled by both protein kinase A and Epac signaling pathways in response to cAMP elevation, and cell-type specifically controlled by insulin and the effectors of the Wnt signaling pathway. This review summarizes our current understanding on the mechanisms underlying gcg transcription and presented my interpretations on how the interactions between different signaling networks regulate gcg expression.","['Jin, Tianru']",['Jin T'],"['Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. tianru.jin@utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,England,J Endocrinol,The Journal of endocrinology,0375363,"['0 (CDX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (PAX2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX2 protein, human)', '0 (POU Domain Factors)', '0 (POU3F4 protein, human)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TCF Transcription Factors)', '0 (TCF7L2 protein, human)', '0 (Tcf7l2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (insulin gene enhancer binding protein Isl-1)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '55963-74-1 (Proglucagon)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDX2 Transcription Factor', 'Cyclic AMP/physiology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'Humans', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'PAX2 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'POU Domain Factors/genetics', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proglucagon/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Response Elements', 'Signal Transduction', 'TCF Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factor 7-Like 2 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Wnt Proteins/physiology', 'Zebrafish Proteins']",2008/06/26 09:00,2009/07/08 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['JOE-08-0085 [pii]', '10.1677/JOE-08-0085 [doi]']",ppublish,J Endocrinol. 2008 Jul;198(1):17-28. doi: 10.1677/JOE-08-0085.,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently many studies have focused on the induction of apoptosis of tumor cells by wogonin. In this study, we found that wogonin could induce differentiation and G1 phase arrest of human U-937 leukemia cells. The growth of U-937 cells incubated with wogonin was inhibited in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. After treatment with wogonin, U-937 cells exhibited the characteristics of mature granulocytes, such as increased cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratio, enhanced prominence of cytoplasmic granules, membrane ruffling, a higher NBT-reducing ability, and an increased expression of CD11b. Moreover, wogonin could induce G1 phase arrest and influenced the expression of associated proteins.

Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of such defects among children greater than one year of age. METHODS: The study was performed on subjects diagnosed with systemic hypertension, aged from 1 to 19 years, with a mean of 12.4 years, in whom we performed echocardiography, using a standard protocol, to establish any end-organ damage or to reveal any congenital cardiac defects. RESULTS: We found a congenital cardiac defect in 5 (3.5%) of the 143 children evaluated. Of these, 4 had not previously been detected, specifically Ebsteins malformation of the tricuspid valve, with moderate regurgitation, a coronary arterial anomaly, a bicuspid aortic valve, and prolapse of the mitral valve permitting regurgitation. In the other patient, we found a non-significant tiny muscular ventricular septal defect. CONCLUSIONS: Our transthoracic echocardiographic investigation revealed previously unsuspected congenital cardiac defects in 4 of 143 older children, with 3 of these requiring further management by a paediatric cardiologist. A similar prevalence has also been reported in older children evaluated echocardiographically for other diseases such as insulin-resistance and leukemia. Hence, it is possible that the prevalence of congenitally malformed hearts is higher than previously reported. When clinically indicated, clinicians should more readily consider obtaining an echocardiogram to help in the identification of such malformations.","['Gupta-Malhotra, Monesha', 'Dave, Archana', 'Sturhan, Brian C', 'McNiece, Karen', 'Syamasundar Rao, P', 'Portman, Ronald']","['Gupta-Malhotra M', 'Dave A', 'Sturhan BC', 'McNiece K', 'Syamasundar Rao P', 'Portman R']","[""Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. monesha.gupta@uth.tmc.edu""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080625,England,Cardiol Young,Cardiology in the young,9200019,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/diagnostic imaging/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypertension/complications', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/12/23 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1047951108002333 [pii]', '10.1017/S1047951108002333 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiol Young. 2008 Aug;18(4):392-6. doi: 10.1017/S1047951108002333.

Here we examined the effect of Ras inhibition by a dominant negative mutant of Ras, N17 H-Ras, in adult hematopoiesis and in BCR/ABL leukemogenesis using the mouse bone marrow transduction and transplantation approach. We found that N17 H-Ras expression suppressed B- and T-lymphopoiesis and erythropoiesis. Interestingly, N17 H-Ras did not suppress myelopoiesis in the bone marrow, yet it greatly attenuated BCR/ABL-induced chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)-like myeloproliferative disease. Most BCR/ABL + N17 H-Ras mice eventually developed pro-B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL). These results suggest that Ras activation is essential for the development of lymphoid and erythroid cells but not myeloid cells and that Ras is a critical target of BCR/ABL in the pathogenesis of CML, but not B-ALL.","['Baum, Karina J', 'Ren, Ruibao']","['Baum KJ', 'Ren R']","['Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, Department of Biology, Brandeis University, Waltham, MA 02454, USA. karibaum@bu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080605,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/*genetics']",2008/06/26 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-5 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-5 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 Jun 5;1:5. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-5.,,"['R01 CA068008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68008/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2438443,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, potent anti-tumorigenic effects induced by LA were also reported and evident as assayed by suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in malignant cells. However, the mechanism by which LA elicits its chemopreventive effects remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Herein, we investigated whether LA elicits its anti-tumor effects by inducing cell cycle arrest and cell death in human promyelocytic HL-60 cells. The results showed that LA inhibits both cell growth and viability in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Disruption of the G1/S and G2/M phases of cell cycle progression accompanied by the induction of apoptosis was also observed following LA treatment. Cell cycle arrest by LA was correlated with dose-dependent down regulation of Rb phosphorylation, likely via suppression of E2F-dependent cell cycle progression with an accompanying inhibition of cyclin E/cdk2 and cyclin B1/cdk1 levels. Evidence supporting the induction of apoptosis by LA was based on the appearance of sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry analysis and the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) from its native 112-kDa form to the 89-kDa truncated product in immunoblot assays. Apoptosis elicited by LA was preceded by diminution in the expression of anti-apoptotic protein bcl-2 and increased expression of apoptogenic protein bax, and also the release and translocation of apoptosis inducing factor AIF and cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the nucleus, without altering the subcellular distribution of the caspases. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that LA induces multiple cell cycle checkpoint arrest and caspase-independent cell death in HL-60 cells, in support of its efficacious potential as a chemopreventive agent.","['Selvakumar, Elangovan', 'Hsieh, Tze-Chen']","['Selvakumar E', 'Hsieh TC']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, New York Medical College, Valhalla, New York 10595, USA. eselva@gmail.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080530,England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Inducing Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '73Y7P0K73Y (Thioctic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Inducing Factor/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Thioctic Acid/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/06/26 09:00,2010/06/04 06:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/06/04 06:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']","['1756-8722-1-4 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8722-1-4 [doi]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2008 May 30;1:4. doi: 10.1186/1756-8722-1-4.,,,PMC2438439,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAT3 acts as a key transcriptional determinant of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal and plays a pivotal function in early mammalian embryogenesis because the development of many organs requires STAT3 activation. However, little is known about the role of STAT3 function during ES cell differentiation. To answer this question, we built a lentiviral construct with 7-repeat STAT3-binding sequence (enhancer) and minimal TA (promoter) driving renilla luciferase and monomeric red fluorescence protein (Rluc-mRFP), followed by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter driving green fluorescent protein as a selection marker. The specificity of our custom-designed 7-repeat STAT3 reporter construct was first confirmed by cotransfection with constitutively active version of STAT3 (STAT3C) into human embryonic kidney 293T cells. Next, a mouse ES cell line stably transduced with STAT3 reporter construct was isolated. This ES cell line showed a tight response in reporter gene expression with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) induction and was chosen as a developmental model for the STAT3 functional study. Using serial noninvasive bioluminescence imaging, we showed that the onset of embryoid body (EB) formation involved inhibition of STAT3 activity. However, during differentiation, STAT3 activity steadily increased from day 5 to 14 and was reduced by day 21. STAT3 activity was also confirmed separately by Western blots. Finally, phosphorylation of STAT3 was also found to correspond with cardiomyocyte differentiation. In summary, this is the first study to monitor real-time STAT3 activity during ES cell differentiation. This genetically modified line can be used to study the biological role of STAT3 during ES cell differentiation into different derivatives.","['Xie, Xiaoyan', 'Chan, Keith S', 'Cao, Feng', 'Huang, Mei', 'Li, Zongjin', 'Lee, Andrew', 'Weissman, Irving L', 'Wu, Joseph C']","['Xie X', 'Chan KS', 'Cao F', 'Huang M', 'Li Z', 'Lee A', 'Weissman IL', 'Wu JC']","['Department of Radiology and Molecular Imaging Program, Division of Cardiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-5344, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (red fluorescent protein)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', '*Imaging, Three-Dimensional', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2008/06/26 09:00,2009/04/09 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/04/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2008.0152 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2009 Mar;18(2):205-14. doi: 10.1089/scd.2008.0152.,,"['R21 HL089027/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL089027/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3133564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of MDS still is mainly based on morphologic findings in blood and marrow. The new WHO classification system takes into account the medullary and peripheral blast count as well as the degree of dysplasia in the different cell lines. To correctly identify MDS types, cytogenetic evaluation is of importance, as the WHO classification introduced the entity MDS with del(5q), which is characterized by special morphologic and hematologic features. The separation of MDS from acute leukemias has been redefined using a cutoff value of 20% peripheral and/or medullary blasts. The International Prognostic Scoring System still is the gold standard in prognostication, but new items like transfusion need will be used more and more and have been incorporated into the WHO adapted Prognostic Scoring System. In childhood, MDS is uncommon, accounting for less than 5% of all hematopoietic neoplasms in patients less than 14 years of age. To accommodate for the characteristics of pediatric MDS, a simple classification scheme based on morphological features and conforming with the WHO suggestions was proposed. The dysplastic prodrome of acute myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome is classified within myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome and excluded from the population-based studies of MDS.","['Germing, Ulrich', 'Aul, Carlo', 'Niemeyer, Charlotte M', 'Haas, Rainer', 'Bennett, John M']","['Germing U', 'Aul C', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Haas R', 'Bennett JM']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich-Heine-University, Moorenstr. 5, 40225 Dusseldorf, Germany. germing@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080625,Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/classification/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0499-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2008 Sep;87(9):691-9. doi: 10.1007/s00277-008-0499-3.

We analysed 88 children (51 boys, 37 girls, mean age at diagnosis: 7.8 years) receiving chemotherapy for malignant diseases (43 acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 15 lymphoma, 20 bone tumor, ten other solid tumors). Serum immunoglobulin levels (Ig), natural killer activity (NK), antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and T and B cell proliferation were determined 1 year after cessation of therapy. The mean levels of Ig were in the normal range at a mean of 13 months after chemotherapy (IgG: 11.2 +/- 3.3, IgA: 1.6 +/- 0.9, IgM: 1.0 +/- 0.5 g/l), however in the leukemic patients serum IgG was below the lower limit of the normal range in 3/43 (7.0%) cases, serum IgA was low in 5/43 (11.6%) and serum IgM was decreased in 4/43 (9.3%) cases. In the solid tumor patients IgG values were within the normal range and only 2-2/45 children had lower values for IgA and IgM (4.4%). NK activity decreased in 7/43 (16.3%) leukemic patients, and in 3/45 (6.7%) solid tumor patients, ADCC decreased in 8/43 (18.6%) and 3/45 (6.7%), respectively (p < 0.001). B-cell blastic transformation was decreased in 3/43 (7%) leukemic patients and in 4/45 (8.9%) solid tumor patients.

Control of cell growth has led to the definition of IRF1 as a tumour suppressor gene and IRF2 as an oncogene. Clinically, approximately 70% of cases of acute myeloid leukaemia demonstrate dysregulated expression of IRF1 and/or IRF2. Our previous studies have shown that human leukaemic TF-1 cells exhibit abnormally high expression of both IRF1 and IRF2, the latter acting to abrogate IRF1 tumour suppression, making these cells ideal for analysis of down-regulation of IRF2 expression. A novel G418 screening protocol was developed and used for identifying effective siRNA that targets IRF2 (siIRF2). Using optimized siIRF2 in leukaemic TF-1 cells, IRF2 was down-regulated by approximately 70% at both mRNA and protein levels. Phenotypically, this resulted in growth inhibition associated with G2/M arrest as well as induction of polyploidy, differentiation and apoptosis. In contrast to these results, siIRF2 targeting did not affect normal haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell growth.

CD38 expression in a high percentage of malignant cells is a risk factor for patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). A previous investigation demonstrated that quantification of CD38 improves upon the prognostic value of the percentage expression. A recent study states that the percentage of CD31 expression is not predictive in B-CLL. We reassessed the predictive power of CD31 in a cohort of 120 patients with B-CLL. Peripheral blood cells were stained with PCP-labelled anti (alpha)-CD19, FITC-alpha-CD5 and PE-alpha-CD31 antibodies. CD31 expression was quantified using beads of specific antibody binding capacity and the density was correlated with clinical outcome. End points were disease-specific survival and time to treatment (TTT). We report that CD31 density was significantly lower in the group of patients with Binet stage B and C of disease progression (P=0.0003). There was an inverse, significant correlation between CD31 and CD38 densities (R= -0.281, P=0.002). All CLL-related deaths occurred in patients with low CD31 density. Low CD31 predicted for poor disease outcome (survival, P=0.0087; TTT, P=0.0064) and identified Binet stage A patients (survival, P=0.0350; TTT, P=0.0716) and those with low CD38 (survival: all patients, P<0.0001; stage A, P=0.003) who followed a more aggressive clinical course. Disease-specific survival of patients with low CD31 and high CD38 densities was significantly shorter than all other groups. In addition, low CD31 density was a poor risk factor irrespective of patient age (survival: all patients, P=0.045; stage A, P=0.021) and identified patients with Binet stage B/C as the highest risk group (P<0.0001). In conclusion, low CD31 density is an adverse prognostic indicator in B-CLL. Also, low CD31 density enhances the prognostic power of CD38 density. The interaction between CD31 and CD38 and its clinical significance in B-CLL requires further investigation.","['Mainou-Fowler, Tryfonia', 'Porteous, Alistair', 'Nicolle, Annette', 'Proctor, Stephen John', 'Anderson, John James', 'Summerfield, Geoffrey']","['Mainou-Fowler T', 'Porteous A', 'Nicolle A', 'Proctor SJ', 'Anderson JJ', 'Summerfield G']","['Academic Haematology, School of Clinical and Laboratory Sciences, William Leech Building, The Medical School, Framlington Place, Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear, NE2 4HH, UK. tryfonia.mainou-fowler@ncl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/analysis', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/immunology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/*analysis', 'Risk Factors']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/09/09 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2008 Jul;33(1):169-74.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differentiated endothelial cells expressed the highest levels of Wnt13 mRNA isoforms among various endothelial and leukemic cell lines. The differentiation of U937 cells towards monocyte/macrophages resulted in an increase of Wnt13B and -C mRNAs while Wnt13A mRNAs were decreased. The differentiation of K562 cells towards megakaryocytes was accompanied with the up-regulation of all Wnt13 mRNA isoforms. In the two differentiation systems, Wnt13B and -C expression correlated with the expression of the MAF-B transcription factor. Our data demonstrate the differential regulation of wnt13 promoters and pinpoint a Wnt13 isoform switch during differentiation of the leukemic U937 cells towards the monocyte/macrophage lineage, thereby suggesting new players in this process.","['Bunaciu, Rodica Petruta', 'Tang, Tao', 'Mao, Catherine D']","['Bunaciu RP', 'Tang T', 'Mao CD']","['Graduate Center for Nutritional Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (MAFB protein, human)', '0 (MafB Transcription Factor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (WNT2B protein, human)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'MafB Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Wnt Proteins/*genetics']",2008/06/26 09:00,2008/08/22 09:00,['2008/06/26 09:00'],"['2008/06/26 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/26 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2008 Jul;20(1):195-201.,,"['R01 HL068698-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL68698/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of cyclosporin A (CsA), a calcineurin-inhibitor used for prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), on IL-15-mediated activation, cytotoxic function and target-induced apoptosis of CB NK cells, was examined in comparison with adult peripheral blood (APB) NK cells. METHODS: CsA was added to anti-CD3+/-IL-15-stimulated CB and APB mononuclear cells (MNC) for a 5-day incubation. CD3- CD56+ NK cell recovery was determined by flow cytometric analysis. Magnetic bead-purified CB and APB NK cells were stimulated with IL-15 for 18 h under the influence of CsA. NK activation (CD69), K562 cytotoxicity and NK-K562 interactions (CD54, perforin and annexin-V expression 4 h following contact with K562 cells) were assessed by flow cytometry. RESULTS: CsA decreased CD3- CD56+ NK cell recovery in anti-CD3-stimulated CB MNC 5-day cultures, an effect that could be counteracted by IL-15; comparable effects were observed with APB. Short-term (18-h) experiments revealed that CsA down-regulated K562 cytotoxicity of IL-15-activated (P=0.018) but not resting (P=0.268) purified CB NK cells. IL-15-induced CB NK CD69 expression showed increased CsA sensitivity over APB (P=0.012). CsA down-regulated K562 cell-induced CD54 (P=0.028) but not perforin (P=0.416) expression of IL-15-activated CB NK cells. Target-induced apoptosis of IL-15-activated CB (P=0.043) but not APB (P=0.144) NK cells was decreased by CsA. DISCUSSION: We have demonstrated differential CsA sensitivity of IL-15-activated CB and APB NK cells. These results may be used to improve the design of IL-15-activated NK cell adoptive immunotherapy in cancer patients receiving CsA post-CB transplantation.","['Lin, S-J', 'Kuo, M-L']","['Lin SJ', 'Kuo ML']","[""Division of Allergy and Immunology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan. sjlino@adm.cgmh.org.tw""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Cytotherapy,Cytotherapy,100895309,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclosporine/*pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Interleukin-15/*immunology', 'K562 Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*drug effects/*immunology', 'Mice']",2008/06/25 09:00,2008/09/10 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['794350848 [pii]', '10.1080/14653240802129885 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytotherapy. 2008;10(4):397-405. doi: 10.1080/14653240802129885.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At transplantation, the median patient age was 39 years (range, 1-67 years); 38 patients were in chronic phase (CP), 13 in the accelerated phase (AP) and 35 in blast crisis (BC). Median duration from diagnosis to UCBT was 1.5 years (range, 0.2-14.6 years). A nucleated cell (NC) dose of more than 3.0 x 10(7) per kg was sufficient to achieve neutrophil (91%) and platelet recovery (86%), whereas the lower dose of NC achieved only 60 and 61%, respectively. The duration and type of pre-transplant treatment did not affect neutrophil or platelet recovery. Results of multivariate analysis indicated that older patients (>50 years) had a higher incidence of transplant-related mortality. Advanced-disease stage and lower doses of NCs were significantly associated with lower leukaemia-free and event-free survival.

Because CLL cells are known to have elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we aimed to test a novel ROS-mediated strategy to eliminate fludarabine-resistant CLL cells based on this redox alteration. Using primary CLL cells and normal lymphocytes from patients (n = 58) and healthy subjects (n = 12), we showed that both fludarabine-resistant and -sensitive CLL cells were highly sensitive to beta-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) with mean IC(50) values of 5.4 microM and 5.1 microM, respectively. Normal lymphocytes were significantly less sensitive to PEITC (IC(50) = 27 microM, P < .001). CLL cells exhibited intrinsically higher ROS level and lower cellular glutathione, which were shown to be the critical determinants of CLL sensitivity to PEITC. Exposure of CLL cells to PEITC induced severe glutathione depletion, ROS accumulation, and oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin leading to massive cell death. Such ROS stress also caused deglutathionylation of MCL1, followed by a rapid degradation of this cell survival molecule. Our study demonstrated that the natural compound PEITC is effective in eliminating fludarabine-resistant CLL cells through a redox-mediated mechanism with low toxicity to normal lymphocytes, and warrants further clinical evaluation.","['Trachootham, Dunyaporn', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Zhang, Wan', 'Feng, Li', 'Du, Min', 'Zhou, Yan', 'Chen, Zhao', 'Pelicano, Helene', 'Plunkett, William', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Huang, Peng']","['Trachootham D', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang W', 'Feng L', 'Du M', 'Zhou Y', 'Chen Z', 'Pelicano H', 'Plunkett W', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Huang P']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, The University of Texas M.

TAT-NPMDeltaC down-regulated several NF-kappaB-controlled survival and inflammatory proteins and suppressed NF-kappaB-driven reporter gene activities. Using an inflammation-associated leukemia model, we demonstrate that TAT-NPMDeltaC induced proliferative suppression and apoptosis of preleukemic stem cells and significantly delayed leukemic development in mice. Mechanistically, TAT-NPMDeltaC associated with wild-type NPM proteins and formed complexes with endogenous NPM and p65 at promoters of several antiapoptotic and inflammatory genes and abrogated their transactivation by NF-kappaB in leu-kemic cells.

Trithorax and polycomb (PcG) group proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulators that maintain the expression of Homeobox (HOX) genes at the epigenetic level during development. Recently, the emerging roles of TrxG and PcG group proteins in cell cycle regulation have begun to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that the mammalian trxG protein MLL5 is involved in multiple cell cycle regulation. Knockdown of MLL5 by small interfering RNA resulted in the retarded cell growth and attenuated intake of BrdU in multiple tumor and normal diploid cells. The cell cycle arrest induced by knockdown of MLL5 took place at both the G1 and G2/M phases. This growth-inhibitory effect and dual-phase arrest were also found in p53-knockout cell lines, suggesting that the transactivation activity of p53 was dispensable for the MLL5-knockdown-mediated cell cycle arrest. In addition, up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and de-phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein were observed in all cell lines tested regardless of their p53 status. Taken together, our data suggest that silencing of MLL5 leads to up-regulation of p21 and dephosphorylation of pRb, which at least partially contributes to the G1 phase and G2/M phase arrest. These findings provide evidence that MLL5 might be an important cell cycle regulator, participating in cell cycle regulatory network machinery at multiple cell cycle stages.","['Cheng, Fei', 'Liu, Jie', 'Zhou, Shun Hui', 'Wang, Xiao Ning', 'Chew, Jun Fang', 'Deng, Lih-Wen']","['Cheng F', 'Liu J', 'Zhou SH', 'Wang XN', 'Chew JF', 'Deng LW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117597, Singapore. chenfei@nus.edu.sg']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080515,Netherlands,Int J Biochem Cell Biol,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,9508482,"['0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2E protein, human)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'RNA Interference', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2008/06/25 09:00,2008/10/09 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1357-2725(08)00177-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.biocel.2008.04.012 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Biochem Cell Biol. 2008;40(11):2472-81. doi: 10.1016/j.biocel.2008.04.012.

A routine full blood count of a single patient revealed that he had CLL. The daily intake of 700ml of fresh bovine milk resulted in a decrease in the lymphocyte count from 85.5x10(9)/l to 12.5x10(9)/l over a period of 5 years. The aim was to establish which constituent(s) in milk would be responsible for the decline of the lymphocyte count. It was found that the higher vitamin D constituent in the milk, the lower the lymphocyte count. Whilst the milk from large dairy farms which use supplements in the feed in order to increase milk production, considerably decreased the lymphocyte count, the milk from small dairy farms, which do not supplement, had hardly any effect. The present study indicates that gossypol in cottonseed cake and oil are potentially responsible for the decrease in white blood cell count. It appears that gossypol is a very powerful anti-neoplastic agent. Free gossypol (Fig. 1) is a toxic phenolic compound which becomes detoxified in ruminants by binding to milk proteins, but gossypol is still an active inhibitor of tumour growth in the excreted milk.","['Politzer, W M']",['Politzer WM'],"['Department of Hematological Pathology, P.O.

Platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) and PDGF-B are important mitogens and chemoattractants for monocytes as well as smooth muscle cells. We sought to identify the role of PDGF-C and PDGF-D, two new members of the PDGF family, in monocyte migration and differentiation. We also assessed their effects in regulating matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9, which are important for cell migration. METHODS AND RESULTS: PDGF-C and PDGF-D were expressed in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells in human atherosclerotic plaques, as shown by immunohistochemical analysis. PDGF-C and PDGF-D mRNA and protein expression was induced after differentiation of THP-1 monocytes to macrophages, and both PDGF-C and PDGF-D induced MMP-9 mRNA expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Treatment of cells with PDGF-C or PDGF-D enhanced the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in a cell-dependent manner. In a migration assay using a Boyden chamber with 8 microm pore size, PDGF-C and PDGF-D attracted THP-1 monocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PDGF-C and PDGF-D, like PDGF-A and PDGF-B, play important roles in atherosclerosis by stimulating MMP activity and influencing monocyte migration.","['Wagsater, Dick', 'Zhu, Chaoyong', 'Bjorck, Hanna M', 'Eriksson, Per']","['Wagsater D', 'Zhu C', 'Bjorck HM', 'Eriksson P']","['Atherosclerosis Research Unit, Center for Molecular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.

To facilitate this task, molecular probes, which bind biomarkers that are either specifically or differentially expressed in diseased cells relative to healthy cells, provide a simple and effective method.

These aptamers are created by means of the cell-based Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment (SELEX) process, which uses whole disease cells as targets. We describe at length the steps of the cell-SELEX process and discuss several applications for the aptamers, including profiling leukemia patient samples and discovering cell-surface cancer biomarkers.

Acquired activated protein C (APC) resistance may be another mechanism responsible for such hypercoagulation, and has been demonstrated in patients with solid tumors, but not in patients with hematological malignancy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate acquired APC resistance in a hypercoagulable cohort of patients with hematological malignancies. PATIENTS/METHODS: Blood samples from 93 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic lymphatic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, were analyzed before start and after completion of cancer therapy. APC resistance was measured using calibrated automated thrombography. The APC sensitivity ratio (APC-SR) was calculated as the ratio of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) determined in plasma probed with either APC or buffer. RESULTS: Untreated patients were found to have higher APC-SR than healthy controls, and patients with AML had higher APC-SR as compared to the other diagnoses, both findings being consistent with acquired APC resistance. The acquired APC resistance was partly ameliorated with cancer treatment. Decreased levels of protein S and TF pathway inhibitor were inversely correlated to APC resistance. CONCLUSIONS: APC resistance may contribute to the hypercoagulable state in hematological malignancies.","['Negaard, H F S', 'Iversen, P O', 'Ostenstad, B', 'Mowinckel, M C', 'Sandset, P M']","['Negaard HF', 'Iversen PO', 'Ostenstad B', 'Mowinckel MC', 'Sandset PM']","['Department of Hematology, Ulleval University Hospital Trust, Oslo, Norway. negaard@medisin.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080628,England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,,IM,"['Activated Protein C Resistance/*complications/therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*complications', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",2008/06/25 09:00,2009/02/06 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/06 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['JTH3060 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.03060.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2008 Sep;6(9):1482-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1538-7836.2008.03060.x.

Donor natural killer cells (NK) and cytokines have good potential in GVHD prevention and immune reconstitution enhancement. Improved survival after allo-HSCT therefore requires effective prophylaxis to reduce GVHD and strategy to mediate graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. We studied the administration of expanded donor NK cell infusion and interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IL-15 mixture treatment in a murine allo-HSCT model for its effects on GVHD, immune reconstitution and leukemia relapse. In the GVHD model, recipient mice were reconstituted with bone marrow (BM) cells and splenocytes via vein. In the leukemia model, recipient mice were inoculated with EL9611 leukemia cells via vein 8 d prior to transplant. NK cell infusion mice group had lower clinical GVHD scores and suffered less severe GVHD-associated weight loss than control mice group. 90% of control mice died of leukemia relapse within 52 d post-transplant. NK cell infusion and IL-2 and IL-15 treatment recipient mice had improved survival compared with control mice. NK cell infusion and IL-2 and IL-15 treatment recipient mice had also accelerated lymphoid immune reconstitution compared with control mice group. Expanded donor NK cell infusion and IL-2 and IL-15 treatment could promote lymphoid immune reconstitution, mitigate GVHD, and reduce leukemia relapse in allo-HSCT recipients.

These cells have a mature DC-like phenotype, are strong stimulators in mixed leukocyte reactions and can be used to generate leukemia-specific cytotoxic T cells. However, recent reports about naturally existing leukemic DC with immunoregulatory dysfunctions in peripheral blood of AML patients caused concerns about the use of AML-DC for therapeutic purposes. Systematic intra-individual comparisons between AML-DC and non-leukemic DC derived from monocytes (MoDC) in AML patients are missing. Thus, we investigated the ability to generate MoDC from peripheral blood of 17 AML patients in first remission and their functional integrity to stimulate leukemia-specific T cells by simple coculture with leukemic blasts. Phenotypic analysis of AML-DC and MoDC from the same individual patients revealed that MoDC exhibit a more homogenous mature DC phenotype. Additionally, functional analysis demonstrated the ability of remission MoDC to activate autologous leukemia-specific T cells in 11 of 12 patients, whereas AML-DC led to a specific T cell activation in four of eight patients. The presented findings might have impact on the design of further therapeutic studies using autologous antigen-presenting cells.","['Draube, Andreas', 'Beyer, Marc', 'Wolf, Jurgen']","['Draube A', 'Beyer M', 'Wolf J']","['Molecular Tumor Biology and Tumor Immunology, Department of Internal Medicine I, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20080628,England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",2008/06/25 09:00,2008/10/15 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['EJH1110 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01110.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2008 Oct;81(4):281-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01110.x.

Some MHC class II gene polymorphisms have been associated with resistance and susceptibility to the development of lymphosarcoma and PL, as well as with a reduced number of circulating BLV-infected lymphocytes. Previously, 230 BLV-infected Holstein cattle were classified into two infection profiles characterized by low and high proviral loads (LPL and HPL respectively). Here, the influence of the polymorphism at the BoLA-DRB3.2* gene of these animals was examined. After genotyping, the association between the BoLA-DRB3.2* alleles and the BLV infection profile was determined as the odds ratio (OR). Two subtypes of allele *11 were identified (ISAG*0901 and *0902). Allele ISAG*0902 showed a stronger association with the LPL profile (OR = 8.24; P < 0.0001) than allele *11 itself (OR = 5.82; P < 0.0001). Allele ISAG*1701 (*12) also showed significant association with the LPL profile (OR = 3.46; P < 0.0055). Only one allele, ISAG*1501 or 03 (*16), showed significant association with HPL (OR = 0.36; P < 0.0005). The DRB3.2* alleles were assigned to three categories: resistant (R), susceptible (S) and neutral (N). Based on their DRB3 genotypes, cattle were classified as homozygous or heterozygous. The RR and RN genotypes were associated with the LPL profile, while the SS and NS genotypes were associated with the HPL profile. The RS genotype could not be associated with any particular profile. Our results show that allele ISAG*0902 appears to be the best BLV resistance marker in Holstein cattle.","['Juliarena, M A', 'Poli, M', 'Sala, L', 'Ceriani, C', 'Gutierrez, S', 'Dolcini, G', 'Rodriguez, E M', 'Marino, B', 'Rodriguez-Dubra, C', 'Esteban, E N']","['Juliarena MA', 'Poli M', 'Sala L', 'Ceriani C', 'Gutierrez S', 'Dolcini G', 'Rodriguez EM', 'Marino B', 'Rodriguez-Dubra C', 'Esteban EN']","['Laboratorio de Virologia, Departamento SAMP, FCV - UNCPBA, Tandil 7000, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080628,England,Anim Genet,Animal genetics,8605704,"['0 (BoLA-DRB3 antigen)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Cattle/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*genetics/immunology/virology', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*genetics/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Viral Load']",2008/06/25 09:00,2008/09/05 09:00,['2008/06/25 09:00'],"['2008/06/25 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/25 09:00 [entrez]']","['AGE1750 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2052.2008.01750.x [doi]']",ppublish,Anim Genet. 2008 Aug;39(4):432-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2052.2008.01750.x.

However, little effort has been paid to their biological application and the concrete effect of Ni NPs on biological systems is still unknown. In this study, the possibility of the utilization of the magnetic Ni NPs in cancer cell studies was explored and the effects of the Ni NPs capped with positively charged tetraheptylammonium on leukemia K562 cells in vitro were investigated. Our observations of optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies indicate that the morphological changes of cancer cells induced by Ni NPs could be apparently observed. The results of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry studies demonstrate that the Ni NPs could exert cytotoxicity to leukemia K562 cells at high concentration, and subsequently induce both apoptosis and necrosis of target cancer cells, whilst it had little impact on target cells when at low concentration. Meanwhile, functionalized Ni NPs with positively charged groups could enhance the permeability of cell membrane and facilitate the cellular uptake of outer target molecules into cancer cells. These findings reveal the potential mechanism of Ni NPs to target cancer cells which could induce the cytotoxicity to leukemia cancer cells and suggest the possibility for applications of the Ni NPs in related clinical and biomedical areas.","['Guo, Dadong', 'Wu, Chunhui', 'Li, Xiaomao', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Chen, Baoan']","['Guo D', 'Wu C', 'Li X', 'Jiang H', 'Wang X', 'Chen B']","['State Key Lab of Bioelectronics (Chien-Shiung Wu Laboratory), Southeast University, Nanjing 210096, P.

Murine APOBEC3 (mA3) is able to inhibit HIV-1, whereas it is inactive against Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). In this work, we present evidence showing that mA3, compared to hA3G, is incorporated inefficiently into MLV, while the abilities of mA3 and hA3G to be packaged into HIV-1 are similar. The nucleocapsid (NC) domain of HIV-1 is capable of facilitating the interaction of mA3 with HIV-1 Gag, and thereby the incorporation of mA3 into HIV-1. Swapping studies of the NC domains in HIV-1 and MLV indicate that MLV NC domain is responsible for viral exclusion of mA3, due to its inability to facilitate the mA3/Gag interaction. The interaction between mA3 and HIV-1 Gag is mediated by the linker region between two zinc coordination motifs in mA3, similar to what has been found for the incorporation of hA3G into both HIV-1 and MLV. These results suggest that the interaction between NC domains and the linker regions might represent a common mechanism for viral incorporation of APOBEC3 proteins, and the inefficient incorporation of endogenous mA3 appears to be a strategy by which MLV escapes the inhibitory effect of mA3.","['Zhang, Li', 'Li, Xiaoyu', 'Ma, Jing', 'Yu, Liyan', 'Jiang, Jiandong', 'Cen, Shan']","['Zhang L', 'Li X', 'Ma J', 'Yu L', 'Jiang J', 'Cen S']","['Department of Virology, Institute of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science, Beijing 100050, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080624,United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC-3G Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3G protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Apobec3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC-3G Deaminase', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cytidine Deaminase/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Nucleocapsid/chemistry/*metabolism', 'gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/metabolism']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0042-6822(08)00334-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.virol.2008.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2008 Aug 15;378(1):69-78. doi: 10.1016/j.virol.2008.05.006.

Given the synergy in vitro between Ara-C and imatinib mesylate on AML cell growth inhibition, we initiated a Phase I study combining CLAG+imatinib mesylate in AML patients. Patients with relapsed, refractory AML or CML myeloid blast crisis were eligible to receive Cladribine 5mg/m(2) days 3-7, Cytarabine 2gm/m(2) days 3-7, G-CSF 300mcg days 2-7, and escalating doses of imatinib mesylate given on days 1-15. The level 1 Gleevec dose was 400mg, while level 2 was 600mg and the level 3 dose 800mg. A total of 16 patients were enrolled, 15 AML and 1 CML myeloid blast crisis. The dose escalation occurred as planned and there was no clear evidence of added toxicity due to imatinib mesylate. One patient with an extensive cardiac history died of cardiac causes on day 1 of therapy however no other deaths occurred within 30 days of starting therapy. One patient had a Grade 3 skin rash at dose level 2. The most common toxicities encountered during induction therapy were nausea, vomiting, rash and diarrhea that were transient and/or reversible. At the 800mg dose 1 patient developed a decline in cardiac ejection fraction on day 20 who later died of sepsis, so this was considered a dose limiting toxicity. Of 16 evaluable patients 11 achieved a hypocellular marrow after initial induction with 1 additional patient achieving a hypocellular marrow following a second course of the same regimen. Four patients (25%) achieved a complete morphologic response with normal cytogenetics, 2 patients (12.5%) achieved a complete morphologic response only and 1 patient had a complete response in the bone marrow but incomplete blood count recovery. The overall response rate was 43.8%. The median overall survival was 175 days (95% CI 16.24-333.76) and the median relapse free survival was 76 days.

The focus was on the cancer risk caused by neutrons outside the treatment volume and the dependency on the patient's age. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Organ-specific neutron-equivalent doses previously calculated for eight different proton therapy brain fields were considered. Organ-specific models were applied to assess the risk of developing solid cancers and leukemia. RESULTS: The main contributors (>80%) to the neutron-induced risk are neutrons generated in the treatment head. Treatment volume can influence the risk by up to a factor of approximately 2. Young patients are subject to significantly greater risks than are adult patients because of the geometric differences and age dependency of the risk models. Breast cancer should be the main concern for females. For males, the risks of lung cancer, leukemia, and thyroid cancer were significant for pediatric patients. In contrast, leukemia was the leading risk for an adult. Most lifetime risks were <1% (70-Gy treatment). The only exceptions were breast, thyroid, and lung cancer for females. For female thyroid cancer, the treatment risk can exceed the baseline risk. CONCLUSION: The risk of developing a second malignancy from neutrons from proton beam therapy of a brain lesion is small (i.e., presumably outweighed by the therapeutic benefit) but not negligible (i.e., potentially greater than the baseline risk).

We report a serological survey of antibodies to T. gondii in domestic cats from northeastern Portugal, by means of the modified agglutination test. Three cats had titres of 20 (3.9%), 18 had titres of 40 (23.7%) and 55 animals had titres of > or =800 (72.4%). Results of three seropositive kittens with less than 4 months were not considered for determining the seroprevalence of infection, which was found to be 35.8% (73/204). Differences in the seroprevalence levels were not statistically significant between males (35.6%) and females (36.0%) or pure non-European (26.7%) and European or mixed-breed cats (39.6%). Animals aged 36-71 months and 72-180 months had the highest seroprevalences of infection, i.e. 51.7% and 51.2%, respectively, which significantly differ from the values observed in cats with 2-11 months (14.6%) and 12-35 months (26.3%). Infection levels were also significantly different between cats that lived totally indoors (7.7%) and those that had access to outdoors (45.4%), as well as between cats living alone (13.8%) and those that had contact with other cats (39.4%). Seroprevalence values in cats fed only commercial canned or dried food (22.9%) and animals whose diet included raw or undercooked viscera and/or meat (53.5%) were also significantly different. Furthermore, considering only 108 cats, differences of seropositivity to T. gondii were significant between feline immunodeficiency virus infected and non-infected animals, but this was not observed for feline leukaemia virus. Age, habitat and diet were identified as risk factors for the feline T. gondii infection by logistic regression analysis. Some control measures are suggested based on these findings.","['Lopes, Ana Patricia', 'Cardoso, Luis', 'Rodrigues, Manuela']","['Lopes AP', 'Cardoso L', 'Rodrigues M']","['Department of Veterinary Sciences, University of Tras-os-Montes e Alto Douro, P.O.

To investigate the role of actin dysfunction by PTX-2 in human leukemia cells, we analyzed the effect of PTX-2 on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that the depolymerization of actin with PTX-2 induces G2/M phase arrest at 12 h and endoreduplication at 24 h. Analysis of the cell cycle regulatory proteins demonstrated that PTX-2 increases phosphorylation of cdc25c and decreases the protein levels of cdc2 and cyclin B1. The M phase specific marker protein, phospho-histone 3, was also increased by PTX-2. Furthermore, p21 and CDK2, which are associated with the induction of endoreduplication, were also upregulated. PTX-2 also inhibited the growth of leukemia cells and caused a marked increase in apoptosis, as characterized by annexin-V+ cells and caspase-3 activity. Interestingly, we found that induction of G2/M phase arrest, endoreduplication, and apoptosis by PTX-2 is regulated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. Inhibitors of ERK and JNK more increased the phosphorylation of cdc25c expression at G2/M arrest stages, and decreased p21 and CDK2 expression at endoreduplication stages and Bax expression at apoptotic stages in the presence of PTX-2. These molecular mechanisms provide that PTX-2 induces G2/M phase arrest, endoreduplication, and apoptosis through the ERK and JNK signal pathway via actin depolymerization.","['Moon, Dong-Oh', 'Kim, Mun-Ock', 'Kang, Sang-Hyuck', 'Lee, Kyeong-Jun', 'Heo, Moon-Soo', 'Choi, Kwang-Sik', 'Choi, Yung Hyun', 'Kim, Gi-Young']","['Moon DO', 'Kim MO', 'Kang SH', 'Lee KJ', 'Heo MS', 'Choi KS', 'Choi YH', 'Kim GY']","['Faculty of Applied Marine Science, Cheju National University, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province 690-756, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080514,England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Furans)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Pyrans)', '97564-91-5 (pectenotoxin 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Actins/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Furans/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Macrolides', 'Pyrans/*pharmacology']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/08/05 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/28 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(08)00306-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2008 Aug 1;76(3):312-21. doi: 10.1016/j.bcp.2008.05.006.

Differentiation induction is considered as one of the effective therapies for leukemia. Piperine, an alkaloid extracted from piperaceae, has been reported to display a variety of pharmacological activities, including sedation, anti-inflammation and antitumor effects. This study was to investigate the effect of piperine on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis of erythroleukemia K562 cells. METHODS: Inhibition of cell growth was determined by trypan blue exclusion test; cell cycle and cell apoptosis were analyzed by FACS; induction of cell differentiation was confirmed by morphological observation, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction assay and measurements of CD33 and CD14 expressions. RESULTS: Piperine induced K562 cells to differentiate into macrophages/monocytes at 20 micromol/L or 40 micromol/L. After incubation with 40 mumol/L piperine for 3 d, the NBT reduction rate of K562 cells increased from (8.5+/-1.9)% to (76.7+/-5.3)%; after incubation with 20 mumol/L piperine for 3 d, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD33 in K562 cells was decreased by 42.05% (P<0.01), whereas the MFI of CD14 was doubled (P<0.01). Piperine inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner at a concentration of above 20 micromol/L.

However, chemotherapy may also lead to cognitive deficits. As growth hormone deficiency (GHD) or impaired growth hormone secretion are frequently found in ALL patients treated with cranial radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, we hypothesized that GH therapy may reduce cognitive deficits in these patients. METHODS: Twenty young adult survivors of childhood ALL with reduced bone mineral density (<-1 SD) and/or low IGF-I SD-scores (<-1 SD) were included in the study. A final group of 13 patients (9 males and 4 females), mean age 23.7 +/- 2.9 years (range 20 - 29.7) completed a 2-year treatment with GH.IQ and neuropsychological performance were assessed at pre-treatment (T1) and after one (T2) and two (T3) years. ANOVA was performed with assessment at T1, T2 and T3 as repeated measurements factor. Relations between test score changes and changes of IGF-I levels were determined by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Scores on the cognitive tests were in the normal range. Verbal short- and long-term memory performance decreased between T1 and T2, and increased between T2 and T3. Performance at T3 was not significantly different from that at T1. Performance for sustained attention improved from T1 to T2 and from T1 to T3. Visual-spatial memory was improved after one year of GH treatment. A significant positive correlation was found for Delta IGF-I (T2-T1) with difference scores of visual-spatial memory (T2-T1 and T3-T1), indicating that IGF-I increase after one year of GH treatment is associated with increase in cognitive-perceptual performance at month 12 and 24. CONCLUSION: Since the level of intellectual functioning of our patient cohort was in the normal range the present finding that GH treatment has negative effects on verbal memory and positive on attention and visual-spatial memory warrants similar studies in other groups of ALL survivors. Also, a lower dose of GH should be determined inducing as much IGF as needed to improve verbal as well as visual cognitive functions. The present findings indicate that more knowledge is needed before GH treatment may be recommended to enhance cognitive functions in ALL survivors.","['Huisman, Jaap', 'Aukema, Eline J', 'Deijen, Jan Berend', 'van Coeverden, Silvia Ccm', 'Kaspers, Gertjan J L', 'van der Pal, Heleen J H', 'Delemarre-van de Waal, Henriette A']","['Huisman J', 'Aukema EJ', 'Deijen JB', 'van Coeverden SC', 'Kaspers GJ', 'van der Pal HJ', 'Delemarre-van de Waal HA']","['Department of Medical Psychology, VU University Medical Center, P,O, Box 7057, 1007 MB Amsterdam, The Netherlands. drj.huisman@vumc.nl']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080620,England,BMC Pediatr,BMC pediatrics,100967804,"['12629-01-5 (Human Growth Hormone)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Attention/drug effects', 'Bone Density/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control/secondary', 'Chemotherapy, Cancer, Regional Perfusion/adverse effects', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Cognition Disorders/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hormone Replacement Therapy', 'Human Growth Hormone/administration & dosage/deficiency/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/analysis', 'Intelligence Tests', 'Male', 'Memory Disorders/chemically induced', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Psychomotor Performance/drug effects', 'Quality of Life', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survivors/*psychology', 'Verbal Learning/drug effects']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2007/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['1471-2431-8-25 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2431-8-25 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Pediatr. 2008 Jun 20;8:25. doi: 10.1186/1471-2431-8-25.,,,PMC2447830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advanced age and a prior history of thrombosis are the major predictors of thrombotic complications. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to outline the current evidence and the authors' opinion regarding the clinical management of patients with essential thrombocythemia. METHODS: The study reviewed the pertinent literature addressing the management options for essential thrombocythemia patients. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Cytoreductive agents can reduce the rate of thrombotic events, but do not affect the overall survival or rate of disease transformation. Thus, a risk-adapted strategy is recommended for the management of patients with essential thrombocythemia. High-risk patients with essential thrombocythemia should be treated with cytoreductive therapy and low-dose aspirin. Hydroxycarbamide is the agent of choice in most patients: however, interferon-alpha is a reasonable alternative in young patients, pregnancy or those intolerant of hydroxycarbamide. Low-risk patients can be safely observed. The management of intermediate-risk patients needs to be individualized: however, low-dose aspirin can be used after excluding acquired von Willebrand's disease. In the future we await the role of molecularly targeted therapy with JAK2 inhibitors in high-risk essential thrombocythemia patients.","['Gangat, Naseema', 'Tefferi, Ayalew']","['Gangat N', 'Tefferi A']","['Mayo Clinic, Division of Hematology, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspirin/therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*drug therapy']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/08/12 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/12 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14656566.9.10.1679 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2008 Jul;9(10):1679-85. doi: 10.1517/14656566.9.10.1679.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have recently shown that the copper-catalyzed D-pen oxidation generates concentration-dependent hydrogen peroxide (H 2O 2). Additionally, D-pen coincubated with cupric sulfate resulted in cytotoxicity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells due to the extracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The inherent physicochemical properties of D-pen such as its short in vivo half-life, low partition coefficient, and rapid metal catalyzed oxidation limit its intracellular uptake and the potential utility as an anticancer agent in vivo. Therefore, to enhance the intracellular delivery and to protect the thiol moiety of D-pen, we designed, synthesized, and evaluated a novel gelatin-D-pen conjugate. D-pen was covalently coupled to gelatin with a biologically reversible disulfide bond with the aid of a heterobifunctional cross-linker ( N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithio)-propionate) (SPDP). Additionally, fluorescein-labeled gelatin-D-pen conjugate was synthesized for cell uptake studies. D-pen alone was shown not to enter leukemia cells. In contrast, the qualitative intracellular uptake of the conjugate in human leukemia cells (HL-60) was shown with confocal microscopy. The conjugate exhibited slow cell uptake (over the period of 48 to 72 h). A novel HPLC assay was developed to simultaneously quantify both D-pen and glutathione in a single run. The conjugate was shown to completely release D-pen in the presence of glutathione (1 mM) in approximately 3 h in PBS buffer, pH 7.4. The gelatin-D-pen conjugate resulted in significantly greater cytotoxicity compared to free D-pen, gelatin alone, and a physical mixture of gelatin and D-pen in human leukemia cells. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential of D-pen conjugate in the delivery of D-pen as a ROS generating anticancer agent.","['Gupte, Anshul', 'Wadhwa, Saurabh', 'Mumper, Russell J']","['Gupte A', 'Wadhwa S', 'Mumper RJ']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536-0082, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080621,United States,Bioconjug Chem,Bioconjugate chemistry,9010319,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Succinimides)', '2OHG8V08NL (N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio)propionate)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', '9000-70-8 (Gelatin)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'GNN1DV99GX (Penicillamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/*chemistry', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Copper/*chemistry', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Disulfides/chemistry', 'Gelatin/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/*metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Penicillamine/*chemistry/toxicity', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Succinimides/chemistry']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/09/16 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/16 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bc800042s [doi]'],ppublish,Bioconjug Chem. 2008 Jul;19(7):1382-8. doi: 10.1021/bc800042s.

Whether their strategies fit or appropriately address these stressor challenges influences adjustment. We examined the fit between pre-treatment stressors reported by hematological cancer patients awaiting allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) and their coping responses. Stressors were categorized as controllable versus uncontrollable; coping responses were categorized as problem- versus emotion-focused versus mixed (i.e., elements of both coping types). We hypothesized that patients would employ coping responses that fit the controllability of stressors (i.e., a match between stressor and coping response): problem-focused coping for controllable stressors and emotion-focused coping for uncontrollable stressors. In qualitative interviews, pre-BMT patients (10 men, 7 women) described encountered stressors and how they coped with them. Every reported stressor was linked with its associated coping response, resulting in a stressor-coping pair. We determined the proportion of total stressor-coping pairs in which the coping response matched the controllability of its linked stressor. Most stressor-coping pairs involving uncontrollable stressors showed the hypothesized match with emotion-focused or mixed coping. Contrary to hypotheses, fewer stressor-coping pairs that involved controllable stressors matched with problem-focused or mixed coping. Rather, these pairs were more likely to link controllable stressors with emotion-focused coping (i.e., mismatch between stressor controllability and type of coping). AlloBMT candidates may appraise the pre-treatment stage, globally, as permitting very little control. Coping efforts may consequently emphasize regulation of negative emotions (i.e., emotion-focused coping).","['Mah, Kenneth', 'Khoraych, Mireille', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Messner, Hans A', 'Khoraych, Ghada', 'Krawiec, Katherine', 'Lefebvre, France', 'Devins, Gerald M']","['Mah K', 'Khoraych M', 'Lipton JH', 'Messner HA', 'Khoraych G', 'Krawiec K', 'Lefebvre F', 'Devins GM']","['Princess Margaret Hospital (University Health Network), Toronto, Canada. kmah@uhnres.utoronto.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Psychol Health Med,"Psychology, health & medicine",9604099,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*psychology', 'Emotions', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*psychology', 'Humans', '*Internal-External Control', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Problem Solving', '*Sick Role', 'Stress, Psychological/*complications/psychology']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['793278696 [pii]', '10.1080/13548500701513724 [doi]']",ppublish,Psychol Health Med. 2008 May;13(3):337-45. doi: 10.1080/13548500701513724.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were 222 febrile neutropenic episodes in 266 ALL patients with documented ANC < 500/mm(3). Of the 222 episodes, 98 (44%) had documented focus of infection; the rest were fever without focus. There were 274 different sites of infection in the 98 episodes of documented focus of infection; pulmonary infections were the commonest site of infection (27.3%) followed by HEENT (22.9%). Of 69 bacterial isolates, gram-negative bacteria (n = 46, 67%) were twice as common as gram-positive bacteria (n = 23, 33%). Most common site of isolation for gram-negative bacteria was blood (50%) followed by urine (32.6%). Blood (78.3%) was predominant site of isolation of gram-positive bacteria followed by HEENT (8.7%). Escherichia coli (45.7%) was the commonest gram-negative isolate, while Staphylococcus aureus (39%) was the commonest gram-positive bacterial isolate. There were a total of 22 fungal isolates, the majority from urine (n = 12) and HEENT (n = 9). Of the 22 fungal isolates, 19 were detected in induction phase of chemotherapy.

However, its effect on telomerase activity and the correlation of this to its observed antitumor effect has yet to be defined. We investigated the effects of this agent on human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression and telomerase activity and found that it significantly down-regulated telomerase activity in both K562 cells and primary leukemic cells. The telomerase activity of primary leukemic cells from CML patients in blastic crisis showed less suppression than that of cells from patients in chronic phase. Additionally, data also demonstrate that inhibition of telomerase was due to the direct action of imatinib on hTERT transcription, rather than an increase in cell death. These results suggest a novel mechanism in the antitumor activity of imatinib and may provide a basis for future development of anti-telomerase therapies, as well as leading to better understanding of the regulation of telomerase in leukemic cells.","['Yamada, Osamu', 'Kawauchi, Kiyotaka', 'Akiyama, Masaharu', 'Ozaki, Kohji', 'Motoji, Toshiko', 'Adachi, Tomoko', 'Aikawa, Eizo']","['Yamada O', 'Kawauchi K', 'Akiyama M', 'Ozaki K', 'Motoji T', 'Adachi T', 'Aikawa E']","[""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. yamadao@lab.twmu.ac.jp""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (TERT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Blast Crisis', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Telomerase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['793973332 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802043861 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jun;49(6):1168-77. doi: 10.1080/10428190802043861.,,,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jun;49(6):1022-3.

Methylation-specific multiplex ligation probe amplification (MS-MLPA) revealed methylation of at least one TSG in 59/119 patients, while no methylation was found in controls. Methylation of different TSGs within patients was substantially correlated (intra-class correlation; 0.38). ESR1 methylation (34/119) strongly predicted concurrent methylation of other genes, OR 7.33 (95%CI 4.13-12.99). A Cox regression model that included the three most frequently methylated TSGs ESR1, CDKN2B/p15 and IGSF4, showed ESR1 to have opposite effects on overall survival (OS) compared with the other two, HR 0.22 (95% CI 0.09-0.53) and HR 1.66 (95% CI 0.73-3.79), HR 1.61 (95%CI 0.66-3.93). By assessment of CDKN2B/p15 and IGSF4 methylation, patients with methylation at multiple loci can be identified. Accumulation of methylation aberrancies is much more pronounced in ESR1 methylated patients. When combined, the methylation status of ESR1, CDKN2B/p15 and IGSF4 enable identification of patient subgroups with large differences in OS (p <0.0001). This study shows that methylation profiling allows risk stratification in AML. In addition, ESR1 methylation may reflect a biological pathway that leads to hypermethylation of multiple genes, which is reflected by methylation of IGSF4 and/or CDKN2B/p15.","['Hess, Corine J', 'Errami, Abdellatif', 'Berkhof, Johannes', 'Denkers, Fedor', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Nygren, Anders O H', 'Schuurhuis, Gerrit J', 'Waisfisz, Quinten']","['Hess CJ', 'Errami A', 'Berkhof J', 'Denkers F', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Nygren AO', 'Schuurhuis GJ', 'Waisfisz Q']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (ESR1 protein, human)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*genetics']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['793942975 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802035990 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Jun;49(6):1132-41. doi: 10.1080/10428190802035990.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here the authors propose vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) down-regulation as another contributory factor in neuronal degeneration induced by ts1 infection. To determine how ts1 affects VEGF expression in ts1-infected brain, the authors examined the expression of several proteins that are important in regulating the expression of VEGF. The authors found significant decreases in Jun-activating domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha, and VEGF levels and increases in p53 protein levels in ts1-infected brains compared to noninfected control brains. The authors suggest that a decrease Jab1 expression in ts1 infection leads to accumulation of p53, which binds to HIF-1alpha to accelerate its degradation. A rapid degradation of HIF-1alpha leads to decreased VEGF production and secretion. Considering that endothelial cells are the most conspicuous in virus replication and production in ts1 infection, but are not killed by the infection, the authors examined the expression of these proteins using infected and noninfected mouse cerebrovascular endothelial (CVE) cells. The ts1- infected CVE cells showed decreased Jab1, HIF-1alpha, and VEGF mRNA and protein levels and increased p53 protein levels compared with noninfected cells, consistent with the results found in vivo. These results confirm that ts1 infection results in insufficient secretion of VEGF from endothelial cells and may result in decreased neuroprotection. This study suggested that ts1-mediated neuropathology in mice may result from changes in expression and activity of Jab1, p53, and HIF-1alpha, with a final target on VEGF expression and neuronal degeneration.","['Lungu, Gina F', 'Stoica, George', 'Wong, Paul K Y']","['Lungu GF', 'Stoica G', 'Wong PK']","['Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.-.- (Cops5 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (COP9 Signalosome Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Brain/blood supply', 'COP9 Signalosome Complex', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Down-Regulation', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism/virology', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus/pathogenicity', 'Nerve Degeneration/pathology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*metabolism/pathology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['794315792 [pii]', '10.1080/13550280802093919 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2008 May;14(3):239-51. doi: 10.1080/13550280802093919.,,"['2R01 NS043984 05 A1/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', '5R01 MH071583 18/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the anti-inflammatory mechanism of bromelain is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the effect of bromelain on cytokine production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. The result showed that bromelain (50-100 microg/ml) significantly and reversibly reduced tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha interleukin- (IL)-1beta and IL-6 from LPS-induced PBMC and THP-1 cells. This effect was correlated with reduced LPS-induced TNF-alpha mRNA and NF-kappaB activity in THP-1 cells. In addition, bromelain dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced prostaglandin E(2), thromboxane B(2) and COX-2 mRNA but not COX-1 mRNA. Importantly, bromelain degraded TNF-alpha and IL-1beta molecules, reduced the expression of surface marker CD14 but not Toll-like receptor 4 from THP-1 cells. Taken together, the results suggest that the suppression of signaling pathways by bromelain's proteolytic activity may contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of bromelain.","['Huang, Jing-Rong', 'Wu, Chia-Chuan', 'Hou, Rolis Chien-Wei', 'Jeng, Kee-Ching']","['Huang JR', 'Wu CC', 'Hou RC', 'Jeng KC']","['Institutes of Biomedical Science, National Chung-Hsing University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9001-00-7 (Bromelains)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Cyclooxygenase 2)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']",IM,"['Bromelains/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclooxygenase 2/immunology/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dinoprostone/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*immunology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/metabolism']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['793374027 [pii]', '10.1080/08820130802083622 [doi]']",ppublish,Immunol Invest. 2008;37(4):263-77. doi: 10.1080/08820130802083622.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subjects were 847 newly diagnosed patients with malignant lymphoma at the Yokohama City University Hospital and 8 affiliated hospitals mainly located in Kanagawa prefecture from 1999 to 2005. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics of primary ENL with primary nodal lymphoma (NL). Histological specimens were evaluated according to the World Health Organization classifications. A total of 395 (46.6%) and 452 (53.4%) patients had primary ENL and primary NL, respectively. The frequency of primary ENL increased with age. Primary extranodal sites included the gastrointestinal tract (30.4%), Waldeyer's ring (17.8%), orbits (7.0%), soft tissue and subcutaneous tissue (5.2%), bone (4.6%), skin (4.3%), thyroid gland (4.3%), testis and prostate (3.3%), bone marrow (3.3%), nasal and paranasal cavities (2.6%), salivary glands (2.3%), lung and pleura (2.0%), breast (1.8%), central nervous system (1.0%), uterus and ovary (0.5%), and others (9.8%). Among the 395 cases of primary ENL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (61.2%) was most frequently diagnosed, followed by extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (13.3%) and follicular lymphoma (5.6%). The frequency of primary ENL is approximately 50% of the total lymphoma cases in Kanagawa, an HTLV-1 nonendemic area in Japan.

We examined the possible concentration-dependent effect of warfarin on cytotoxicity with respect to oxidative stress on leukemia cell lines (K562 and HL-60) and normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Gamma radiation was used as a positive control agent for oxidative stress. At all concentrations of warfarin (5-200 muM), 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (luminol)- and bis-N-methylacridinium nitrate (lucigenin)-amplified chemiluminescence responses and lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation were stable after 72 h incubation at 37 degrees C. However, The 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) oxidation was increased when cells were incubated with high concentrations (50-200 muM) of warfarin. In these concentration ranges, warfarin reduced cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, producing apoptosis. Our results also revealed that at concentrations above 5 muM, warfarin had a potentiating effect on radiation-mediated growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore, marked effects were observed on leukemic cells compared with PBMC. We report here that the increase of DCFH oxidation might be due to the increase in the release of cytochrome C caused by warfarin, as cytosolic cytochrome C content was significantly elevated in the warfarin-treated cells compared with control cells, and because cotreatment with antioxidants N- acetylcysteine or 4,5-dihydroxy-1,3-benzene-disulfonic acid (Tiron) was unable to prevent cytochrome C release and DCFH oxidation induced by the drug. Taken together, these results suggest that high warfarin concentrations may be toxic to leukemic cells in vitro through apoptosis, although at the pharmacological concentrations (<50 muM), warfarin has no prooxidant or cytotoxic effect on PBMC, K562, and HL-60 cells. In addition, when the treatment of leukemic cells with warfarin at concentrations above 5 muM is combined with radiation, we observed an increase in radiation-induced cytotoxicity. The mechanism by which warfarin potentiates this cytotoxicity is unclear, but it may not be directly due to toxic damage induced by warfarin-generated free radicals.","['Onaran, Ilhan', 'Sencan, Sevide', 'Demirtas, Halil', 'Aydemir, Birsen', 'Ulutin, Turgut', 'Okutan, Murat']","['Onaran I', 'Sencan S', 'Demirtas H', 'Aydemir B', 'Ulutin T', 'Okutan M']","['Department of Medical Biology, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University, Ortaklar Cd.

We have identified a regulatory pathway in normal megakaryopoiesis, involving the PLZF transcription factor, miR-146a and the SDF-1 receptor CXCR4. In leukaemic cell lines PLZF overexpression downmodulated miR-146a and upregulated CXCR4 protein, whereas PLZF knockdown induced the opposite effects. In vitro assays showed that PLZF interacts with and inhibits the miR-146a promoter, and that miR-146a targets CXCR4 mRNA, impeding its translation. In megakaryopoietic cultures of CD34(+) progenitors, PLZF was upregulated, whereas miR-146a expression decreased and CXCR4 protein increased. MiR-146a overexpression and PLZF or CXCR4 silencing impaired megakaryocytic (Mk) proliferation, differentiation and maturation, as well as Mk colony formation. Mir-146a knockdown induced the opposite effects. Rescue experiments indicated that the effects of PLZF and miR-146a are mediated by miR-146a and CXCR4, respectively.

Because numerous effects modulated by TQ can be linked to interference with the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappa B) signaling, we investigated in detail the effect of this quinone on NF-kappa B pathway. As examined by DNA binding, we found that TQ suppressed tumor necrosis factor-induced NF-kappa B activation in a dose- and time-dependent manner and inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory stimuli. The suppression of NF-kappaB activation correlated with sequential inhibition of the activation of I kappa B alpha kinase, I kappa B alpha phosphorylation, I kappa B alpha degradation, p65 phosphorylation, p65 nuclear translocation, and the NF-kappa B-dependent reporter gene expression. TQ specifically suppressed the direct binding of nuclear p65 and recombinant p65 to the DNA, and this binding was reversed by DTT. However, TQ did not inhibit p65 binding to DNA when cells were transfected with the p65 plasmid containing cysteine residue 38 mutated to serine. TQ also down-regulated the expression of NF-kappa B-regulated antiapoptotic (IAP1, IAP2, XIAP Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin), proliferative (cyclin D1, cyclooxygenase-2, and c-Myc), and angiogenic (matrix metalloproteinase-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor) gene products. This led to potentiation of apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor and chemotherapeutic agents. Overall, our results indicate that the anticancer and antiinflammatory activities previously assigned to TQ may be mediated in part through the suppression of the NF-kappa B activation pathway, as shown here, and thus may have potential in treatment of myeloid leukemia and other cancers.","['Sethi, Gautam', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Sethi G', 'Ahn KS', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)', 'O60IE26NUF (thymoquinone)']",IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus/drug effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Benzoquinones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Carcinogens/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/metabolism', 'I-kappa B Proteins/metabolism', 'Inflammation Mediators/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Transcription Factor RelA/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A/metabolism']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['6/6/1059 [pii]', '10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-2088 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2008 Jun;6(6):1059-70. doi: 10.1158/1541-7786.MCR-07-2088.,,['5P30CA016672-32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['Mol Cancer Res. 2018 Sep;16(9):1441.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: About 300 sequential samples were collected from 40 patients during the course of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) disease. Telomerase activity (TA) and terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length were assessed by TRAP and Southern blot analyses, respectively. PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa)/glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase transcripts were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: About 90% of the patients had a significant reduction in telomere length (TL) relative to the control (median 3.5 versus 11.37 kbp; P < 0.001). A significant positive correlation between TL and PML-RARa expression was found (P = 0.001). Telomerase was activated in all patients; however, TA level was significantly higher in the group of relapsed patients than patient with newly diagnosed. The group of patients with shortened TRF and elevated TA had a significantly poorer overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The shortened TL and elevated TA in APL patients are mainly indicative of extensive proliferative activity and they correlate with disease progression and relapse; thus, they may serve as prognostic factors for a subset of APL patients with more aggressive disease and poor outcome, those who may not respond favorably to arsenic therapy.","['Ghaffari, S H', 'Shayan-Asl, N', 'Jamialahmadi, A H', 'Alimoghaddam, K', 'Ghavamzadeh, A']","['Ghaffari SH', 'Shayan-Asl N', 'Jamialahmadi AH', 'Alimoghaddam K', 'Ghavamzadeh A']","['Hematology, Oncology and BMT Research Center, Tehran University Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. shghaffari2000@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080620,England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Cell Growth Processes/drug effects/physiology', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate', 'Telomerase/*blood', 'Telomere/drug effects/*metabolism']",2008/06/24 09:00,2008/11/05 09:00,['2008/06/24 09:00'],"['2008/06/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/05 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0923-7534(19)40145-2 [pii]', '10.1093/annonc/mdn394 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2008 Nov;19(11):1927-34. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdn394.

PML loss occurs frequently in hematopoietic and solid tumors. PML loss often correlates with tumor progression. Casein kinase 2 (CK2) is a stress-activated serine/threonine protein kinase that is oncogenic and frequently overexpressed in human tumor of multiple histological origins. In addition, CK2 overexpression due to gene amplification has been reported to be an adverse prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer. At the 5th International Conference on Protein Kinase CK2 in Padova, Italy, we reviewed our recent findings that PML undergoes ubiquitin/proteasome-mediated degradation in immortalized and tumor derived cell lines. PML degradation depends on direct CK2 phosphorylation of PML Ser517. PML mutants that are resistant to CK2 phosphorylation display increased tumor suppressive functions in assays measuring apoptosis, replicative senescence, and in xenograft models. More significantly, CK2 pharmacological inhibition enhances PML tumor suppressive property. These data identify a key post-translational mechanism that controls PML protein levels in cancer cells and suggest that CK2 inhibitors may be beneficial anti-cancer drugs.","['Scaglioni, P P', 'Yung, T M', 'Choi, S', 'Baldini, C', 'Konstantinidou, G', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Scaglioni PP', 'Yung TM', 'Choi S', 'Baldini C', 'Konstantinidou G', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX 75390-8852, USA. pier.scaglioni@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080620,Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinase II)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/enzymology', 'Casein Kinase II/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Thermodynamics', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11010-008-9812-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2008 Sep;316(1-2):149-54. doi: 10.1007/s11010-008-9812-7.

None of these models incorporates the anti-leukemia immune response. Recent experimental data show that imatinib treatment may promote the development of anti-leukemia immune responses as patients enter remission. Using these experimental data we develop a mathematical model to gain insights into the dynamics and potential impact of the resulting anti-leukemia immune response on CML. We model the immune response using a system of delay differential equations, where the delay term accounts for the duration of cell division. The mathematical model suggests that anti-leukemia T cell responses may play a critical role in maintaining CML patients in remission under imatinib therapy. Furthermore, it proposes a novel concept of an ""optimal load zone"" for leukemic cells in which the anti-leukemia immune response is most effective. Imatinib therapy may drive leukemic cell populations to enter and fall below this optimal load zone too rapidly to sustain the anti-leukemia T cell response. As a potential therapeutic strategy, the model shows that vaccination approaches in combination with imatinib therapy may optimally sustain the anti-leukemia T cell response to potentially eradicate residual leukemic cells for a durable cure of CML. The approach presented in this paper accounts for the role of the anti-leukemia specific immune response in the dynamics of CML. By combining experimental data and mathematical models, we demonstrate that persistence of anti-leukemia T cells even at low levels seems to prevent the leukemia from relapsing (for at least 50 months). As a consequence, we hypothesize that anti-leukemia T cell responses may help maintain remission under imatinib therapy. The mathematical model together with the new experimental data imply that there may be a feasible, low-risk, clinical approach to enhancing the effects of imatinib treatment.","['Kim, Peter S', 'Lee, Peter P', 'Levy, Doron']","['Kim PS', 'Lee PP', 'Levy D']","[""Laboratoire des Signaux et Systemes, Ecole Superieure d'Electricite, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080620,United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides', 'Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*immunology/pathology', '*Models, Immunological', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*immunology']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/26 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2007/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000095 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2008 Jun 20;4(6):e1000095. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000095.,,"['R01 CA130817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA130817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2427197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that the worm Bcl-2 homology domain-3 (BH3)-only protein EGL-1 binds mammalian pro-survival proteins very poorly, but can be converted into a high-affinity ligand for Bcl-2 and Bcl-x(L) by subtle mutation of the cysteine residue at position 62 within the BH3 domain. A 100-fold increase in affinity was observed following a single atom change (cysteine to serine substitution), and a further 10-fold increase by replacement with glycine. The low affinity of wild-type EGL-1 for mammalian pro-survival proteins and its poor expression correlates with its weak killing activity in mammalian cells whereas the high-affinity C62G mutant is a very potent killer of cells lacking Mcl-1. Cell killing by the C62S mutant with intermediate affinity only occurs when this EGL-1 BH3 domain is placed in a more stable context, namely that of Bim(S), which allows higher expression, though the kinetics of cell death now vary depending on whether Mcl-1 is neutralized by Noxa or genetically deleted. These results demonstrate how levels of BH3-only proteins, target affinity and the spectrum of neutralization of pro-survival proteins all contribute to killing activity.","['Lee, E F', 'Chen, L', 'Yang, H', 'Colman, P M', 'Huang, D C S', 'Fairlie, W D']","['Lee EF', 'Chen L', 'Yang H', 'Colman PM', 'Huang DC', 'Fairlie WD']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080620,England,Cell Death Differ,Cell death and differentiation,9437445,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Bcl2l11 protein, mouse)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (EGL-1 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Caenorhabditis elegans/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/*physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics/*metabolism']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/10/28 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/28 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['cdd200886 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Death Differ. 2008 Oct;15(10):1609-18. doi: 10.1038/cdd.2008.86.

METHODS: 26 patients with acute leukemia have been studied. The cardiac echo evaluation was performed at the baseline (before CT), after the first CT (mean cumulative anthracyclines dose 136.3-/+28.3 mg m(-2)), after the last CT (mean cumulative anthracyclines dose 464.3-/+117.5 mg m(-2)) and circa 6 months after the completion of CT. RESULTS: We found a significant decrease in LVEF (65.3-/+4.5' vs 60.2-/+5.7', p<0.01), the fractional shortening of the LV (34.8-/+3.7', vs 29.5-/+5.0', p<0.01), but the mitral flow rapid filling velocity (E-wave) was not changed (0.74-/+0.18 ms(-1), vs 0.67-/+0.17 ms(-1), p ns), and atrial filling velocity (A-wave) increased (0.66-/+0.15 ms(-1) vs 0.78-/+0.18 ms(-1), p<0.01). E/A ratio significantly decreased (1.18-/+0.35 vs 0.89-/+0.27, p<0.01). IVRT increased (71.5-/+11.6 ms vs 84.0-/+11.6 ms, p<0.01). DT E-wave velocity increased (162.3-/+25.8 ms vs 206.7-/+25.5 ms, p<0.01). After the first CT, the signs of LV diastolic dysfunction were detected in 5 (19.2') patients. 6 months after the last CT, two of these patients (7.7') developed LV systolic dysfunction with the clinical symptoms of heart failure. Six months after the last CT, 12 (46.2') patients developed the signs of LV diastolic dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Chemotherapy can induce early changes of diastolic left ventricular function. We consider using Doppler echocardiography as the election tool not only for baseline cardiologic screening but also for the monitoring of the earliest subclinical signs of cardiotoxicity.","['Pudil, R', 'Horacek, J M', 'Strasova, A', 'Jebavy, L', 'Vojacek, J']","['Pudil R', 'Horacek JM', 'Strasova A', 'Jebavy L', 'Vojacek J']","['Charles University Prague, 1st Dept. of Medicine, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. pudilradek@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Anthracyclines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Diastole', 'Echocardiography, Doppler/methods', 'Female', 'Heart Atria/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Ventricular Function, Left/*drug effects']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['35/691 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2008 Jun;30(2):160-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We evaluated anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in 12 acute myeloid leukemia patients (mean age 51.3-/+10.7 years, 7 females). All biomarkers were measured at the baseline, after first chemotherapy (CT) with anthracyclines, after last CT with anthracyclines (total cumulative dose 479.8-/+106.2 mg/m2) and 6 months thereafter. Values above the reference range were considered elevated. RESULTS: GPBB increased above the cut-off (7.30 microg/L) in 2 (16.7%) patients after first CT, in 3 (25.0%) patients after last CT and remained elevated in 2 (16.7%) patients within 6 months after CT. CTnI became elevated (above 0.40 microg/L) in 1 (8.3%) patient after first and last CT and within 6 months after CT. CTnT remained negative (below 0.01 microg/L) during CT in all patients. Six months after CT, delayed cTnT positivity was found in 1 (8.3%) patient. All patients with cTnI or cTnT positivity had elevated GPBB. Other biomarkers (myoglobin, CK-MB mass, H-FABP) remained within the reference range in all patients. CONCLUSION: Our preliminary results suggest that GPBB could be a new promising marker for detection of anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity and probably superior to cardiac troponins. The predictive value for development of cardiomyopathy in the future is not clear and will be evaluated during a prospective follow-up.","['Horacek, J M', 'Tichy, M', 'Jebavy, L', 'Pudil, R', 'Ulrychova, M', 'Maly, J']","['Horacek JM', 'Tichy M', 'Jebavy L', 'Pudil R', 'Ulrychova M', 'Maly J']","['2nd Department of Medicine-Clinical Hematology, University Hospital and Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. jan.hor@post.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Glycogen Phosphorylase)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (glycogen phosphorylase BB, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anthracyclines/*toxicity', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Glycogen Phosphorylase/metabolism', 'Heart/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/09/04 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",['35/690 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2008 Jun;30(2):157-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities were classified as qualitative (i.e. leukemic cluster growth) or quantitative (i.e. strongly reduced/absent growth). Thirty-nine patients (53%) showed leukemic growth, 26 patients (36%) had strongly reduced/absent colony growth, and 12 patients showed both. In a univariate analysis the presence of leukemic growth was associated with strongly reduced survival (at 10 years 4 vs. 34%, p = 0.004), and a high incidence of transformation to AML (76 vs. 32%, p = 0.01). Multivariate analysis identified leukemic growth as a strong and independent predictor of early death (relative risk 2.12, p = 0.03) and transformation to AML (relative risk 2.63, p = 0.04). Quantitative abnormalities had no significant impact on the disease course. CFU-C assays have a significant predictive value in addition to established prognostic factors in MDS.

Based on spinning disk confocal microscopy analyses, we report the first real-time visualization of C3b deposition and C-mediated killing of RTX-opsonized B cells. C activation by RTX-opsonized Daudi B cells induces rapid membrane blebbing and generation of long, thin structures protruding from cell surfaces, which we call streamers. Ofatumumab, a unique mAb that targets a distinct binding site (the small loop epitope) of the CD20 Ag, induces more rapid killing and streaming on Daudi cells than RTX. In contrast to RTX, ofatumumab promotes streamer formation and killing of ARH77 cells and primary B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Generation of streamers requires C activation; no streaming occurs in media, NHS-EDTA, or in sera depleted of C5 or C9. Streamers can be visualized in bright field by phase imaging, and fluorescence-staining patterns indicate they contain membrane lipids and polymerized actin. Streaming also occurs if cells are reacted in medium with bee venom melittin, which penetrates cells and forms membrane pores in a manner similar to the membrane-attack complex of C. Structures similar to streamers are demonstrable when Ab-opsonized sheep erythrocytes (non-nucleated cells) are reacted with NHS. Taken together, our findings indicate that the membrane-attack complex is a key mediator of streaming. Streamer formation may, thus, represent a membrane structural change that can occur shortly before complement-induced cell death.","['Beum, Paul V', 'Lindorfer, Margaret A', 'Beurskens, Frank', 'Stukenberg, P Todd', 'Lokhorst, Henk M', 'Pawluczkowycz, Andrew W', 'Parren, Paul W H I', 'van de Winkel, Jan G J', 'Taylor, Ronald P']","['Beum PV', 'Lindorfer MA', 'Beurskens F', 'Stukenberg PT', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Pawluczkowycz AW', 'Parren PW', 'van de Winkel JG', 'Taylor RP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antigens, CD20/immunology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Protein Transport', 'Rituximab', 'Time Factors']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/1/822 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.822 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jul 1;181(1):822-32. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.822.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic studies have demonstrated that the Bcl-2 family member Mcl-1 is an important anti-apoptotic protein in the development of multiple cell types including T lymphocytes. However, the expression pattern and anti-apoptotic roles of Mcl-1 in T lymphocytes at different developmental stages remain to be fully determined. In this study, we examined the expression pattern of Mcl-1 in different populations of T cells at the single-cell level and found that Mcl-1 protein is constitutively expressed in all T cell populations and up-regulated upon TCR stimulation. We then investigated the role of Mcl-1 in the survival of these different populations by conditionally deleting Mcl-1 at various T cell stages. Our results show that Mcl-1 is required for the survival of double-negative and single-positive thymocytes as well as naive and activated T cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Mcl-1 functions together with Bcl-xL to promote double-positive thymocyte survival. Thus, Mcl-1 is a critical anti-apoptotic factor for the survival of T cells at multiple stages in vivo.","['Dzhagalov, Ivan', 'Dunkle, Alexis', 'He, You-Wen']","['Dzhagalov I', 'Dunkle A', 'He YW']","['Department of Immunology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/classification/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/1/521 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.521 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jul 1;181(1):521-8. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.521.,,"['R01 AI074754/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI054658-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI54683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA092123-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA92123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI054658/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2561902,['NIHMS66462'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used expression arrays to reveal differences in the gene expression profiles of an apoptosis-resistant T cell leukemia clone (A4) and normally apoptosis-sensitive parental Jurkat cells. CD73 (ecto-5'-nucleotidase) was the most up-regulated gene in the resistant A4 cell clone. A4 cells displayed CD73 surface expression and significant ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. The role of CD73 was confirmed by transfection of wild-type CD73 into native Jurkat cells, which led to specific resistance against TRAIL-induced apoptosis, but not other types of apoptosis. The protective role of CD73 was further confirmed by small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of CD73, restoring TRAIL sensitivity. CD73-mediated resistance was independent of enzymatic activity of CD73, but was reliant on the anchoring of the protein to the membrane via GPI. We suggest that the inhibition of TRAIL signaling works through interaction of CD73 with death receptor 5, as CD73 and death receptor 5 could be coimmunoprecipitated and were shown to be colocalized in the plasma membrane by confocal microscopy. We propose that CD73 is a component of multiresistance machinery, the transcription of which is activated under selective pressure of the immune system.","['Mikhailov, Andrey', 'Sokolovskaya, Alice', 'Yegutkin, Gennady G', 'Amdahl, Hanne', 'West, Anne', 'Yagita, Hideo', 'Lahesmaa, Riitta', 'Thompson, Linda F', 'Jalkanen, Sirpa', 'Blokhin, Dmitry', 'Eriksson, John E']","['Mikhailov A', 'Sokolovskaya A', 'Yegutkin GG', 'Amdahl H', 'West A', 'Yagita H', 'Lahesmaa R', 'Thompson LF', 'Jalkanen S', 'Blokhin D', 'Eriksson JE']","['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku/Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)""]",IM,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/genetics/*metabolism"", '*Apoptosis', 'Binding Sites', 'Down-Regulation', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunochemistry', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*metabolism']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/1/464 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.464 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jul 1;181(1):464-75. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.464.,,"['R01 AI018220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI18220/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5584620,['NIHMS897990'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To address this, it would be important to understand how gene expression differs between memory and naive B cells to elucidate memory-specific functions. Using model systems that help overcome the lack of murine memory-specific markers and the low frequency of Ag-specific memory and naive cells, we undertook a global comparison of gene expression between memory B cells and their naive precursors. We identified genes with differential expression and confirmed the differential expression of many of these by quantitative RT-PCR and of some of these at the protein level. Our initial analysis revealed differential expression patterns of genes that regulate signaling. Memory B cells have increased expression of genes important in regulating adenosine signaling and in modulating cAMP responses. Furthermore, memory B cells up-regulate receptors that are essential for embryonic stem cell self-renewal. We further demonstrate that one of these, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, can initiate functional signaling in memory B cells whereas it does not in naive B cells. Thus, memory and naive B cells are intrinsically wired to signal differently from one another and express a functional signaling pathway that is known to maintain stem cells in other lineages.","['Tomayko, Mary M', 'Anderson, Shannon M', 'Brayton, Catherine E', 'Sadanand, Saheli', 'Steinel, Natalie C', 'Behrens, Timothy W', 'Shlomchik, Mark J']","['Tomayko MM', 'Anderson SM', 'Brayton CE', 'Sadanand S', 'Steinel NC', 'Behrens TW', 'Shlomchik MJ']","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. mary.tomayko@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Prkar2b protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bmpr1a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors, Type I/genetics', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIIbeta Subunit/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/*immunology', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/29 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['181/1/27 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.27 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2008 Jul 1;181(1):27-38. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.181.1.27.,,"['R01 AI122448/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'A143603/PHS HHS/United States', 'T32 AR007016/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 AI078533/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI043603/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4437802,['NIHMS525696'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express high levels of antiapoptotic proteins that act as a survival mechanism for these replicationally quiescent lymphocytes, we investigated whether gossypol induces apoptosis in these cells and what mechanism underlies gossypol-mediated cytotoxicity. Gossypol induced cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner; 24-hour incubation with 30 microM gossypol resulted in 50% cell death (median; range, 10%-80%; n = 47) that was not abrogated by pan-specific caspase inhibitor. Starting at 4 hours, the mitochondrial outer membrane was significantly permeabilized (median, 77%; range, 54%-93%; n = 15). Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabiliztaion (MOMP) was concurrent with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, antioxidants did not abrogate gossypol-induced cell death. Mitochondrial membrane permeabilization was also associated with loss of intracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), activation of BAX, and release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which was translocated to the nucleus. Blocking AIF translocation resulted in a decreased apoptosis, suggesting that AIF contributes to gossypol-mediated cytotoxicity in CLL lymphocytes.","['Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Balakrishnan K', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas M.

Complete remission with or without blood recovery was achieved in 46% of patients receiving induction chemotherapy, but remissions were not durable with a median progression-free survival of only 5 months. Eight patients received SCT either as first therapy or after responding to antileukemia therapy. These patients had a markedly superior survival, with 73% alive at a median follow-up of 31 months. JAK2V617F kinetics were assessed in 16 patients: 0 of 4 negative patients became positive at transformation, and among 12 positive patients, 1 had an increase in JAK2V617F% at transformation, 7 had a substantial decrease, and 4 had stable levels. Myeloproliferative neoplasm blast phase is associated with a dismal prognosis. Responses to chemotherapy can be achieved but are not durable.

To identify targets for potential combination therapies, we have begun to characterize signaling pathways leading to As2O3-induced cytotoxicity. Previously, we described the requirement for a reactive oxygen species-mediated, SEK1/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway to induce apoptosis. AKT inhibits several steps in this pathway; therefore, we postulated that As2O3 might decrease its activity. Indeed, As2O3 decreases not only AKT activity but also total AKT protein, and sensitivity to As2O3 correlates with the degree of AKT protein decrease. Decreased AKT expression further correlates with JNK activation and the release of AKT from the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein known to assemble the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. We found that As2O3 regulates AKT protein stability without significant effects on its transcription or translation. We show that As2O3 decreases AKT protein via caspase-mediated degradation, abrogated by caspase-6, caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 inhibitors but not proteosome inhibitors. Furthermore, As2O3 enhances the ability of a heat shock protein 90 inhibitor to decrease AKT expression and increase growth inhibition. This suggests that As2O3 may be useful in combination therapies that target AKT pathways or in tumors that have constitutively active AKT expression.","['Mann, Koren K', 'Colombo, Myrian', 'Miller, Wilson H Jr']","['Mann KK', 'Colombo M', 'Miller WH Jr']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Segal Cancer Center, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (MAPK8IP1 protein, human)', '0 (Oxides)', '4GY0AVT3L4 (tanespimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic/pharmacology', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/6/1680 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2164 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Jun;7(6):1680-7. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular targeting of Bcl-X(L) and/or Bcl-2 in HNSCC cells has been shown to promote apoptosis signaling and to sensitize cells to chemotherapy drugs, including cisplatin, which is commonly used in the treatment of HNSCC. We report that induction of HNSCC apoptosis by the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is accompanied by up-regulation of the proapoptotic proteins Bik and Bim, natural cellular inhibitors of Bcl-X(L) and Bcl-2. Additionally, bortezomib treatment of HNSCC cells caused up-regulation of antiapoptotic Mcl-1L. Inhibition of Bik or Bim up-regulation using small interfering RNA markedly attenuated bortezomib-induced cell death. By contrast, small interfering RNA-mediated inhibition of Mcl-1L expression resulted in enhanced killing by bortezomib. Further investigation showed that the combination of bortezomib and cisplatin led to synergistic killing of HNSCC cells, with calculated combination indexes well below 1.0. Taken together, these results delineate a novel mechanism of HNSCC killing by bortezomib that involves up-regulation of Bik and Bik. Moreover, our findings suggest that the combination of bortezomib plus cisplatin, or bortezomib plus an inhibitor of Mcl-1L, may have therapeutic value in the treatment of HNSCC.","['Li, Changyou', 'Li, Rongxiu', 'Grandis, Jennifer R', 'Johnson, Daniel E']","['Li C', 'Li R', 'Grandis JR', 'Johnson DE']","['Departments of University of Pittsburgh and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BCL2L11 protein, human)', '0 (BIK protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Boronic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Bortezomib', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Proteasome Inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['7/6/1647 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2444 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2008 Jun;7(6):1647-55. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-2444.,,"['P50 CA097190/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097190-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50-CA097190/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2534142,['NIHMS57772'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We screened 1,625 patients who were enrolled onto the Austrian and German ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ALL-BFM) trials 86, 90, 95, and 2000 with ETV6/RUNX1-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes, and we identified 29 patient cases (2%) who had an iAMP21. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was quantified with clone-specific immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were good responders to prednisone, and all achieved remission after induction therapy. Eleven patients experienced relapse, which included eight who experienced relapse after cessation of front-line therapy. Six-year event-free and overall survival rates were 37% +/- 14% and 66% +/- 11%, respectively. Results of MRD analysis were available in 24 (83%) of 29 patients: nine (37.5%) belonged to the low-risk, 14 (58.5%) to the intermediate-risk, and one (4%) to the high-risk group. MRD results were available in 8 of 11 patients who experienced a relapse. Seven occurred among the 14 intermediate-risk patients, and one occurred in the high-risk patient. CONCLUSION: The overall and early relapse rates in the BFM study were lower than that in a previous United Kingdom Medical Research Council/Childhood Leukemia Working Party study (38% v 61% and 27% v 47%, respectively), which might result from more intensive induction and early reintensification therapy in the ALL-BFM protocols.

Our goals were to describe the incidence of ON and identify patient and treatment characteristics associated with elevated risk. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The rate of self-reported ON was determined for 9,261 patients enrolled onto the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, a cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed from 1970 to 1986, and compared with the rate in a random sample of 2,872 siblings of survivors. Survivors with positive responses were reinterviewed to confirm the diagnosis. RESULTS: Fifty-two cancer survivors reported ON in 78 joints, yielding 20-year cumulative incidence of 0.43% and a rate ratio (RR) of 6.2 (95% CI, 2.3 to 17.2) compared with siblings, adjusted for age and sex; 44% developed ON in a previous radiation field. The RR was greatest among survivors of stem-cell transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (RR = 26.9, 66.5, and 93.1, respectively). Nontransplantation patients with ALL (RR = 6.5; 95% CI, 2.2 to 19.4), AML (RR = 11.2; 95% CI, 2.1 to 61.2), and bone sarcoma (RR = 7.3; 95% CI, 2.0 to 26.2) were at higher risk for ON. Older age at diagnosis, shorter elapsed time, older treatment era, exposure to dexamethasone (+/- prednisone), and gonadal and nongonadal radiation were independently associated with ON. CONCLUSION: ON among long-term survivors of childhood cancer is rare.

Risk factors remain poorly defined. Because CRHR1 polymorphisms have been associated with other corticosteroid effects, our goal was to define whether CRHR1 polymorphisms predict which patients with ALL are likely to develop bone mineral deficits. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The mean bone mineral density z scores of 309 long-term survivors of ALL were determined by quantitative computed tomography of the trabecular lumbar spine. We analyzed whether CRHR1 genotypes, adjusted for sex, ALL treatment regimen, and weight, could predict bone density. RESULTS: We found that three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with bone density in a sex-specific manner. Bone density was lower in males (P = .001), in nonblack patients (P < .08), in those who were not overweight (P < .001), and in those who received intensive antimetabolites and glucocorticoids (P < .001). After adjustment for these features, the G allele at the rs1876828 SNP was associated with lower z scores (P = .02) in males but tended to have the opposite association in females (P = .09). CONCLUSION: CRHR1 polymorphisms may impact the risk of bone density deficits in patients treated with corticosteroids and antimetabolites in a sex-specific manner.","['Jones, Terreia S', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Liu, Wei', 'Cheng, Cheng', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Tantisira, Kelan G', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Relling, Mary V']","['Jones TS', 'Kaste SC', 'Liu W', 'Cheng C', 'Yang W', 'Tantisira KG', 'Pui CH', 'Relling MV']","['Department of Radiology, Colleges of Pharmacy and Medicine, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Receptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '5CLY6W2H1M (CRF receptor type 1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Bone Density/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone/*genetics', 'Survivors']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/18/3031 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.6399 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 20;26(18):3031-7. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.6399.,,"['U01 HL65899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'PS207386/PS/NCHHSTP CDC HHS/United States', 'CA 51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 HL065899/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-nine consecutive patients (median age at first assessment, 6.8 years; range, 4.0 to 11.8 years) treated with intrathecal and systemic chemotherapy were included in a nationwide, prospective-longitudinal, sibling-controlled study. Patients and siblings completed three extensive neuropsychological assessments: at diagnosis, 3 to 6 months after completion of (2-year) treatment and 4.5 years after diagnosis. Assessments included measures of learning, memory, attention, speed, executive functioning, visual-constructive functioning, and fine-motor functioning. Multilevel analyses were applied to evaluate patients' performances over time and to compare patients to 29 siblings (median age of siblings at first assessment, 8.2 years; range, 4.5 to 12.6 years) and to normative data. RESULTS: No major differences were found in neuropsychological performance between patients and siblings, with both groups performing mainly in the normal range. The patient group as a whole, however, scored significantly lower than the siblings on complex fine-motor functioning at the last evaluation. Large practice effects were found for both patients and siblings in four of 11 tasks. Patients who uttered physical complaints (ie, pain and/or tiredness) at the first pretreatment assessment scored significantly lower than siblings on attention and speed at the last two evaluations. CONCLUSION: Despite intensive and potentially neurotoxic treatment, no evident negative, neuropsychological late effects were found 4.5 years after diagnosis, except for effects on complex fine-motor functioning. Both the large practice effects observed and the poorer performances on sustained attention for patients with physical complaints should be reckoned with in prospective, longitudinal neuropsychological research in children.","['Jansen, Nathalie C A J', 'Kingma, Annette', 'Schuitema, Arnout', 'Bouma, Anke', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Kamps, Willem A']","['Jansen NC', 'Kingma A', 'Schuitema A', 'Bouma A', 'Veerman AJ', 'Kamps WA']","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Beatrix Children's Hospital Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, PO Box 30,001, 9700 RB Groningen, the Netherlands.

Here, we aimed to identify molecular profiles specific for treatment resistance to the current standard of care of concomitant chemoradiotherapy with the alkylating agent temozolomide. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression profiles of 80 glioblastomas were interrogated for associations with resistance to therapy. Patients were treated within clinical trials testing the addition of concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide to radiotherapy. RESULTS: An expression signature dominated by HOX genes, which comprises Prominin-1 (CD133), emerged as a predictor for poor survival in patients treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy (n = 42; hazard ratio = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.38 to 5.26; P = .004). This association could be validated in an independent data set. Provocatively, the HOX cluster was reminiscent of a ""self-renewal"" signature (P = .008; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) recently characterized in a mouse leukemia model. The HOX signature and EGFR expression were independent prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, adjusted for the O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation status, a known predictive factor for benefit from temozolomide, and age. Better outcome was associated with gene clusters characterizing features of tumor-host interaction including tumor vascularization and cell adhesion, and innate immune response. CONCLUSION: This study provides first clinical evidence for the implication of a ""glioma stem cell"" or ""self-renewal"" phenotype in treatment resistance of glioblastoma. Biologic mechanisms identified here to be relevant for resistance will guide future targeted therapies and respective marker development for individualized treatment and patient selection.","['Murat, Anastasia', 'Migliavacca, Eugenia', 'Gorlia, Thierry', 'Lambiv, Wanyu L', 'Shay, Tal', 'Hamou, Marie-France', 'de Tribolet, Nicolas', 'Regli, Luca', 'Wick, Wolfgang', 'Kouwenhoven, Mathilde C M', 'Hainfellner, Johannes A', 'Heppner, Frank L', 'Dietrich, Pierre-Yves', 'Zimmer, Yitzhak', 'Cairncross, J Gregory', 'Janzer, Robert-Charles', 'Domany, Eytan', 'Delorenzi, Mauro', 'Stupp, Roger', 'Hegi, Monika E']","['Murat A', 'Migliavacca E', 'Gorlia T', 'Lambiv WL', 'Shay T', 'Hamou MF', 'de Tribolet N', 'Regli L', 'Wick W', 'Kouwenhoven MC', 'Hainfellner JA', 'Heppner FL', 'Dietrich PY', 'Zimmer Y', 'Cairncross JG', 'Janzer RC', 'Domany E', 'Delorenzi M', 'Stupp R', 'Hegi ME']","['Laboratory of Tumor Biology and Genetics, Centre Universitaire Romand de Neurochirurgie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois and University of Lausanne, Lausanne 1011, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Adult Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Brain Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'ErbB Receptors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Glioblastoma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Temozolomide']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/07/09 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['26/18/3015 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.7164 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jun 20;26(18):3015-24. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.7164.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We documented that Kpm/Lats2 was markedly decreased in several leukemias that were highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Silencing of Kpm/Lats2 expression in leukemic cells did not change the rate of cell growth but rendered the cells more resistant to DNA damage-inducing agents. Expression of p21 and PUMA was strongly induced by these agents in control cells, despite defective p53, but was only slightly induced in Kpm/Lats2-knockdown cells. DNA damage-induced nuclear accumulation of p73 was clearly observed in control cells but hardly detected in Kpm/Lats2-knockdown cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed that p73 was recruited to the PUMA gene promoter in control cells but not in Kpm/Lats2-knockdown cells after DNA damage. The analyses with transient coexpression of Kpm/Lats2, YAP2, and p73 showed that Kpm/Lats2 contributed the stability of YAP2 and p73, which was dependent on the kinase function of Kpm/Lats2 and YAP2 phosphorylation at serine 127. Our results suggest that Kpm/Lats2 is involved in the fate of p73 through the phosphorylation of YAP2 by Kpm/Lats2 and the induction of p73 target genes that underlie chemosensitivity of leukemic cells.","['Kawahara, Masahiro', 'Hori, Toshiyuki', 'Chonabayashi, Kazuhisa', 'Oka, Tsutomu', 'Sudol, Marius', 'Uchiyama, Takashi']","['Kawahara M', 'Hori T', 'Chonabayashi K', 'Oka T', 'Sudol M', 'Uchiyama T']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080618,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (TP73 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Protein p73)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (YAP-Signaling Proteins)', '0 (YAP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (LATS1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.11 (LATS2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/metabolism', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21/genetics', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Protein p73', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'YAP-Signaling Proteins']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/11/13 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)51946-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-111773 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Nov 1;112(9):3856-66. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-111773.

RESULTS: IL-1beta-treated human chondrocytes showed significant increases in the expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor-3, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 and leukemia inhibitory factor as well as for a large group of chemokines that include CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL20, CCL3L1, CX3CL1 and the cytokine IL-6. As expected, the mRNA for matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13 and BMP-2 also increased while mRNA for the matrix genes COL2A1 and aggrecan was down-regulated. A subset of chemokines increased rapidly at very low levels of IL-1beta. The phenotype induced by IL-1beta was partially reversed by TGF-beta1, but not by BMP-2. In the presence of IL-1beta, FGF-18 increased expression of ADAMTS-4, aggrecan, BMP-2, COL2A1, CCL3, CCL4, CCL20, CXCL1, CXCL3, CXCL6, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-8 and decreased ADAMTS-5, MMP-13, CCL2, and CCL8. Computational analysis revealed a high likelihood that the most up-regulated chemokines are regulated by the transcription factors myocyte enhancer binding factor-3 (MEF-3), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). CONCLUSION: IL-1beta has a diverse effect on gene expression profile in human chondrocytes affecting matrix genes as well as chemokines and cytokines. TGF-beta1 has the ability to antagonize some of the phenotype induced by IL-1beta.","['Sandell, L J', 'Xing, X', 'Franz, C', 'Davies, S', 'Chang, L-W', 'Patra, D']","['Sandell LJ', 'Xing X', 'Franz C', 'Davies S', 'Chang LW', 'Patra D']","['Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, St Louis, MO 63110, United States. sandelll@wustl.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080618,England,Osteoarthritis Cartilage,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,9305697,"['0 (Chemokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (fibroblast growth factor 18)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",IM,"['Arthritis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cartilage, Articular/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chondrocytes/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation']",2008/06/21 09:00,2009/02/21 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1063-4584(08)00144-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.joca.2008.04.027 [doi]']",ppublish,Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2008 Dec;16(12):1560-71. doi: 10.1016/j.joca.2008.04.027.

The aim of this study was to determine the potency and specificity of parasporal inclusions from Malaysian mosquitocidal Bt isolates against a leukemic cell line (CEM-SS). The Bt isolates used in this study were identified as having weak to potent larvicidal activity against Aedes aegypti and varying hemolytic activity. The 12 mosquitocidal Bt isolates examined in this study showed low to moderate cytotoxicity when tested against CEM-SS and HeLa. Interestingly the parasporal inclusions of Bt 18 (non-hemolytic isolate), showed therapeutic potential demonstrating specificity for CEM-SS compared to HeLa, whilst being non-cytotoxic to normal T lymphocytes. The mode of cell death by Bt 18 was shown to be initially apoptotic. SDS-PAGE analysis and N-terminal sequencing of the upper and lower bands of Bt 18 showed similarity between Bt 18 parasporal inclusions with Cry 24Aa and 25Aa of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp jegathesan and Cry 15Aa of Bacillus thuringiensis subsp israelensis. Although the BLAST analysis did not show sequence similarity between Bt 18 and Parasporin, we propose that the Bt 18 parasporal inclusions share similar characteristics to Parasporin since Bt 18 is not hemolytic but discriminately cytotoxic towards leukemic cell lines.","['Nadarajah, V D', 'Ting, D', 'Chan, K K', 'Mohamed, S M', 'Kanakeswary, K', 'Lee, H L']","['Nadarajah VD', 'Ting D', 'Chan KK', 'Mohamed SM', 'Kanakeswary K', 'Lee HL']","['Human Biology, Cells and Molecule Section, Faculty of Medicine, International Medical University, Kuala Lumpur; vishnadevi_nadarajah@imu.edu.my']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Thailand,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health,The Southeast Asian journal of tropical medicine and public health,0266303,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Bacillus thuringiensis/*chemistry', 'Bacterial Proteins/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Spores, Bacterial/chemistry']",2008/06/21 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/21 09:00'],"['2008/06/21 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/21 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Southeast Asian J Trop Med Public Health. 2008 Mar;39(2):235-45.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood cultures from the recipient and cultures of remnants from the pooled PLT bag grew group C streptococci (GCS). An investigation was conducted to identify both the infection's source and the reasons for the false-negative screening result. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Red blood cell (RBC) units (cocomponent from the eight donations) were traced, quarantined, and cultured. Specimens from the implicated donor were obtained. Isolates were identified and typed by 16S rRNA and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The blood center screening method was reviewed. RESULTS: beta-Hemolytic GCS, cultured from 1 of 8 RBC units, linked the fatal case to a single donor. The donor's throat swab collected 20 days after donation was positive for the presence of GCS, identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. Isolates from the recipient, RBC unit, residual PLTs, and donor's throat swab were indistinguishable by PFGE. The donor denied any symptoms of infection before or after donation. PLT bacterial screening at the blood center was performed using a commercially available bacterial detection system (BacT/ALERT, bioMerieux) with a threshold of 15 colony-forming units per bag. CONCLUSION: An asymptomatic donor was implicated as the source of GCS-contaminated PLTs. Current screening methods for PLTs are not sufficient to detect all bacterial contamination. Pooled PLTs are a particular challenge because the small volume of individual units places limits on culturing strategies. Improved detection of bacterial contamination of PLTs is needed.","['Lessa, Fernanda', 'Leparc, German F', 'Benson, Kaaron', 'Sanderson, Roger', 'Van Beneden, Chris A', 'Shewmaker, Patricia L', 'Jensen, Bette', 'Arduino, Matthew J', 'Kuehnert, Matthew J']","['Lessa F', 'Leparc GF', 'Benson K', 'Sanderson R', 'Van Beneden CA', 'Shewmaker PL', 'Jensen B', 'Arduino MJ', 'Kuehnert MJ']","['Office of Workforce and Career Development, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Coordinating Center for Infectious Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. flessa@cdc.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",20080628,United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,,IM,"['Aged', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Platelets/*microbiology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Platelet Transfusion/*adverse effects', 'Streptococcal Infections/*transmission', 'Streptococcus/classification/*isolation & purification']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/11/15 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/11/15 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['TRF01802 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01802.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2008 Oct;48(10):2177-83. doi: 10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.01802.x.

The GVL effect is mediated by donor-derived natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, which have distinct mechanisms of recognizing and targeting the recipient's malignant cells. After transplantation the cytokine milieu is favourable to the early establishment of a GVL effect, but the need to prevent graft-versus-host disease limits the full potential of this process. Clinical studies have identified some critical components of the transplant preparation, donor selection, stem cell source (peripheral blood versus bone marrow) and post-transplant management that can be manipulated to optimize the GVL effect. However, further developments focusing on the selective depletion of unwanted alloreactivity with preservation of GVL effects, and the use of vaccines or the adoptive transfer of leukaemia-specific lymphocytes, will be required to enhance the GVL effect to reliably eradicate more resistant leukaemias.","['Barrett, A John']",['Barrett AJ'],"['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1220, USA. barrettj@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",20080628,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7260 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07260.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Sep;142(6):877-88. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07260.x.

We performed multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis in 50 CLL patients to identify multiple genomic CLL-specific targets, including genes located at 13q14, 17p13 (TP53), 11q23 (ATM) and chromosome 12, and compared the results with those obtained with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). There was a good correlation between MLPA and FISH results, as most alterations (89%) were detected by both techniques. Only three cases with a low percentage (<25%) of cells carrying the alterations were not detected by MLPA. On the other hand, as MLPA uses multiple probes it identified intragenic or small alterations undetected by FISH in three cases. MLPA also detected alterations in 8q24 (MYC) and 6q25-26. In summary, unlike interphase FISH, MLPA enabled the simultaneous analysis of many samples with automated data processing at a low cost. Therefore, the combination of robust multiplexing and high throughput makes MLPA a useful technique for the analysis of genomic alterations in CLL.","['Coll-Mulet, Llorenc', 'Santidrian, Antonio F', 'Cosialls, Ana M', 'Iglesias-Serret, Daniel', 'de Frias, Merce', 'Grau, Javier', 'Menoyo, Anna', 'Gonzalez-Barca, Eva', 'Pons, Gabriel', 'Domingo, Alicia', 'Gil, Joan']","['Coll-Mulet L', 'Santidrian AF', 'Cosialls AM', 'Iglesias-Serret D', 'de Frias M', 'Grau J', 'Menoyo A', 'Gonzalez-Barca E', 'Pons G', 'Domingo A', 'Gil J']","[""Departament de Ciencies Fisiologiques II, IDIBELL-Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080617,England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Amplification', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genes, p53', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/*methods', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Spain', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['BJH7268 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07268.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2008 Sep;142(5):793-801. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07268.x.

However, malignant cells present in the testicular tissue may disturb spermatogenesis in the xenografts. Here we examined the effect of human leukemia cells on ectopic xenografts in immunodeficient mice. METHODS: First, in order to evaluate the tumor forming ability of Human leukemia cells (Jurkat cells), different amounts of these cells were injected into nude mice and analyzed 8 weeks later. Testicular tissues from 5-week-old donor SCID mice injected with Jurkat cells were xenografted under the skin of recipient nude mice. After 8 weeks, xenografts were histologically evaluated and expression of testicular markers in xenografts was assessed. RESULTS: More than 1 x 10(6) Jurkat cells were necessary to develop a tumor under the skin of nude mice. Eight weeks after xenografting, 5 of 20 xenografts (25%) developed tumors. Spermatogenesis was not detected in any xenografts. Testicular cells were not detected in the tumor by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction technique. CONCLUSIONS: Human leukemia cells infiltrating testicular tissue may disturb spermatogenesis in xenografts. Xenografting cannot be considered a reliable method for the detection of human leukemic cells in testicular tissues before auto-transplantation. Other measures should be developed to preserve the fertility of prepubertal boys with leukemia.","['Fujita, Kazutoshi', 'Tsujimura, Akira', 'Hirai, Toshiaki', 'Ohta, Hiroshi', 'Matsuoka, Yasuhiro', 'Miyagawa, Yasushi', 'Takao, Tetsuya', 'Takada, Shingo', 'Nonomura, Norio', 'Okuyama, Akihiko']","['Fujita K', 'Tsujimura A', 'Hirai T', 'Ohta H', 'Matsuoka Y', 'Miyagawa Y', 'Takao T', 'Takada S', 'Nonomura N', 'Okuyama A']","['Department of Urology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080616,Australia,Int J Urol,International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,9440237,,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', '*Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Testis/*transplantation', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/12/19 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['IJU2087 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-2042.2008.02087.x [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Urol. 2008 Aug;15(8):733-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1442-2042.2008.02087.x.

However, the occurrence of cases of leukemia after the X-SCID gene therapy trial raised concerns about the safety of insertional mutagenesis inherent to the biology of the retrovirus. Although the retrovirus has long been known to integrate into the host chromosome, and thus have the potential to activate the nearby gene, there has been no convenient method of studying or assaying such a cis-activation phenomenon. METHODS: In the present study, we report an in vitro assay system in which the effect of retroviral integration on the expression of the neighbouring gene can be studied. In this system, a retroviral vector and the neighbouring reporter gene were constructed in a single plasmid as if it had integrated into the chromosome. RESULTS: Using this assay, we found that the full-length long terminal repeat (LTR) could indeed activate the neighbouring gene expression from a distance and the magnitude of its activation was highly increased when this LTR was placed in the vicinity of the transcription start site of the gene, whereas the truncated LTR exerted little influence.

We show that the success of a dose-schedule-finding method requires careful statistical modeling and a sensible dose-schedule allocation scheme. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that jointly models the unordered probabilities of toxicity and efficacy and apply a Bayesian isotonic transformation to the posterior samples of the toxicity probabilities, so that the transformed posterior samples adhere to the matrix-order constraints. On the basis of the joint posterior distribution of the order-constrained toxicity probabilities and the unordered efficacy probabilities, we develop a dose-schedule-finding algorithm that sequentially allocates patients to the best dose-schedule combination under certain criteria. We illustrate our methodology through its application to a clinical trial in leukemia and compare it with two alternative approaches.","['Li, Yisheng', 'Bekele, B Nebiyou', 'Ji, Yuan', 'Cook, John D']","['Li Y', 'Bekele BN', 'Ji Y', 'Cook JD']","['Department of Biostatistics, Division of Quantitative Sciences, University of Texas M.

In an attempt to identify new mechanisms of resistance, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of an imatinib-resistant cell line generated from the erythroblastic cell line K562 (K562-r) for which no known mechanism of resistance has been detected. Bidimensional gel electrophoresis was carried out to compare the protein expression pattern of imatinib-sensitive and of imatinib-resistant K562 cells. Among the 400 matched spots on five pairs of gels, only 14 spots had a significantly increased or decreased expression leading to the identification of 24 proteins identified as scaffold proteins, metabolic enzymes, DNA translation and maturation, and chaperon proteins. Among the chaperon family, only Hsp70 and Hsc70 are overexpressed in K562-r, results confirmed by Western blotting. We recently reported the participation of Hsp70 overexpression in imatinib resistance whereas a role for Hsc70 has yet to be determined. Hsc70 is not involved in imatinib resistance as the inhibition of its expression by siRNA does not restore sensitivity to imatinib. In contrast, the induced decreased expression of Hsc70 was accompanied by a greater overexpression of Hsp70.

MTT assay was used to determine the DADS induced cell growth inhibition in HL-60 cells. Flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation were used to examine the roles of apoptosis in DADS-mediated cell death. Western blot analysis of the expression of phospho-MAPKs (ERK and p38) was employed to elucidate the possible mechanisms of DADS induced apoptosis. We found that growth inhibition of HL-60 cells treated with DADS exhibited a dose-dependent response (P<0.05) and DADS induced significant apoptosis. DADS at the concentration of 10 mg/L persistently activated p38 and simultaneously reduced ERK activity. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK upstream activators MAPK kinase MKK1 and MKK2, promoted cytotoxicity and apoptosis in HL-60 cells treated with DADS. In contrast, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38, decreased cytotoxicity and apoptosis induced by DADS. Therefore, DADS can effectively inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of human leukemia cell line HL-60. Inhibition of ERK signaling pathways and activation of p38 signaling pathways are likely involved in DADS induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Tan, Hui', 'Ling, Hui', 'He, Jie', 'Yi, Lan', 'Zhou, Jianguo', 'Lin, Min', 'Su, Qi']","['Tan H', 'Ling H', 'He J', 'Yi L', 'Zhou J', 'Lin M', 'Su Q']","['Cancer Research Institute, University of South China, Hengyang City, Hunan Province, 421001, P.R.China. tanhuiy@sohu.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080619,Korea (South),Arch Pharm Res,Archives of pharmacal research,8000036,"['0 (Allyl Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '5HI47O6OA7 (diallyl disulfide)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'OU13V1EYWQ (SB 203580)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)']",IM,"['Allyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Shape/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/09/20 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s12272-001-1227-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pharm Res. 2008 Jun;31(6):786-93. doi: 10.1007/s12272-001-1227-0.

Here we review the recently identified and characterized putative leukemia antigens, the main vaccination strategies employed by most investigators and the results of clinical studies of immunotherapy of myeloid leukemias. Although these studies are early and often difficult to interpret, they offer evidence that effective immunity to leukemia could be induced following vaccination, and that clinical benefit can sometimes be observed, thus setting the stage for future development of this strategy and in the combinatorial approaches to treatment of myeloid leukemias that incorporate immunotherapy.","['el-Shami, K', 'Smith, B D']","['el-Shami K', 'Smith BD']","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231-1000, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20080619,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods/trends', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008148 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.148 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1658-64. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.148.

The chymotrypsin-like activities were assayed by measuring the release of the fluorescent 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) from the substrate N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC. Cytogenetic studies were performed using R-banded metaphases and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. IkappaB-alpha levels were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: No cross-resistance to daunorubicin, adriamycin, vindesine, and etoposide was found in JurkatB cells. No evidence of drug efflux was found in JurkatB cells and the expression of P-gp was negative. The PSMB5 mRNA was overexpressed in highly resistant JurkatB5 and JurkatB1 lines compared with parental Jurkat, corresponding well with the increase of chymotrypsin-like activity and a karyotype of i(14q). Amplification of PSMB5 gene was demonstrated by in situ hybridization and FISH. The decreased IkappaB-alpha level in JurkatB5 cells after bortezomib treatment indicating an upregulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of bortezomib resistance is different from that of multidrug resistance. Overexpression of PSMB5 is an important mechanism for bortezomib resistance in JurkatB lines. NF-kappaB may play a critical role in evading the apoptotic effects.","['Lu, Shuqing', 'Chen, Zhilong', 'Yang, Jianmin', 'Chen, Li', 'Gong, Shenglan', 'Zhou, Hong', 'Guo, Lieping', 'Wang, Jianmin']","['Lu S', 'Chen Z', 'Yang J', 'Chen L', 'Gong S', 'Zhou H', 'Guo L', 'Wang J']","['Department of Hematology, Changhai Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080617,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Boronic Acids)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Ubiquitin)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (PSMB5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Boronic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Bortezomib', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chymotrypsin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells/drug effects', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/drug therapy/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Ubiquitin/drug effects/metabolism']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/12/17 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/12/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00184-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.013 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Oct;36(10):1278-84. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.013.

DESIGN: A retrospective noncomparative interventional case series. PARTICIPANTS: Seven eyes of 4 patients in whom CMV retinitis developed after allogeneic HSCT using alemtuzumab. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed. CMV retinitis was diagnosed by the presence of characteristic ophthalmoscopic findings and confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-based detection of CMV in vitreal biopsy specimens. The affected eyes received intravitreal injections of 2 mg/0.1 mL of ganciclovir twice weekly during induction therapy until the lesions were inactive, followed by weekly injections as maintenance therapy. Maintenance intravitreal therapy continued until the lesions consisted of an atrophic retina with pigment epithelium mottling and attenuated vessels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, response of retinitis lesions, and postoperative complications. RESULTS: From 1999 to 2007, 294 patients received allogeneic HSCTs at our institution. Among the HSCTs, 65 were unrelated transplants, and of these, 17 were performed using alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimens. Only 4 patients went on to develop CMV retinitis. These 4 patients had several features in common. All patients received transplants from unrelated donors after an alemtuzumab-conditioning regimen for acute leukemia. One patient died before initiation of treatment. Three patients exhibited a bilateral disease, and 3 patients had neutropenia. Patients underwent a mean of 8.3 intravitreal ganciclovir injections in each eye. All 3 treated patients showed a good response. The treatment was well tolerated without serious adverse events during the mean follow-up period of 8.5 months (range, 4.5-16 months). CONCLUSIONS: An increased incidence of CMV retinitis was noted in unrelated patients undergoing HSCT using a nonmyeloablative alemtuzumab-based conditioning regimen. Intravitreal ganciclovir therapy seems to be an acceptable therapeutic option in these patients given the nature of their systemic illness, which prohibits the use of typical systemic anti-CMV drugs.","['Song, Won Kyung', 'Min, Yoo Hong', 'Kim, Yu Ri', 'Lee, Sung Chul']","['Song WK', 'Min YH', 'Kim YR', 'Lee SC']","['Department of Ophthalmology, The Institute of Vision Research, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080617,United States,Ophthalmology,Ophthalmology,7802443,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/*adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytomegalovirus Retinitis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Ganciclovir/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Visual Acuity']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/10/31 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/13 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0161-6420(08)00376-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Ophthalmology. 2008 Oct;115(10):1766-70. doi: 10.1016/j.ophtha.2008.04.015.

We investigated whether leukemic blasts from acute myeloid leukemic (AML) and acute lymphoid leukemic (ALL) patients produced LTB(4), 12- and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (12-HETE and 15-HETE) and whether these compounds affected blast proliferation and apoptosis. Leukemic blasts from AML M(0-2) and ALL patients expressed 5-LOX, 12-LOX and 15-LOX transcripts. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction indicated that 5-LOX transcripts were far more abundant than 12-LOX and 15-LOX ones. Leukemic blasts expressed 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) transcripts and produced LTB(4) in response to calcium ionophore. In contrast no 15-HETE production was found. Calcium ionophore-stimulated leukemic blasts produced 12-HETE but also released thromboxane A(2) suggesting that contaminating platelets accounted for the release of these compounds. No significant effect of LTB(4), 12-HETE or 15-HETE could be documented on leukemic blast growth and on their apoptose rate. Results of the present study indicate that immature form of leukemic blasts produce LTB(4). However, the three major lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid; i.e., LTB(4), 12-HETE or 15-HETE, had no evident effect on their growth and apoptosis. We may speculate that LTB(4)-derived blast cells might initiate, augment or prolong tissue inflammation and damages by affecting the marrow and blood cytokine network.","['Vincent, Christelle', 'Fiancette, Remi', 'Donnard, Magali', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Turlure, Pascal', 'Trimoreau, Franck', 'Denizot, Yves']","['Vincent C', 'Fiancette R', 'Donnard M', 'Bordessoule D', 'Turlure P', 'Trimoreau F', 'Denizot Y']","['Universite de Limoges, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, CNRS UMR 6101, Faculte de Medecine, 2 rue Dr. Marcland, 87025 Limoges, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080618,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1HGW4DR56D (Leukotriene B4)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '57576-52-0 (Thromboxane A2)', '59985-28-3 (12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['12-Hydroxy-5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic Acid/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/classification/*enzymology/pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/metabolism', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukotriene B4/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*enzymology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Thromboxane A2/metabolism']",2008/06/20 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2008/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/06 00:00 [revised]', '2008/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00244-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Nov;32(11):1756-62. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.05.005.

However, we sometimes encounter patients in whom puncture cannot be performed for several reasons. Recently, endoscopic transpapillary gallbladder drainage (ETGD) has been reported to be safe and effective for acute cholecystitis. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of ETGD for acute cholecystitis in which a percutaneous transhepatic approach is contraindicated or anatomically impossible. DESIGN: Retrospective case study. SETTING: This procedure was performed in Tokyo Medical University Hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-three patients with acute cholecystitis, including 32 patients taking anticoagulation or antiplatelet drugs, 4 cases of Chilaiditi syndrome, 2 each of acute leukemia, marked ascites, and anatomic abnormality, and 1 case of hemophilia A. INTERVENTION: All patients underwent ETGD. A 5F nasobiliary-drainage catheter was placed into the gallbladder. In case of failed ETGD, PTGBD or PTGBA was performed subsequently. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Efficacy and safety of this technique. RESULTS: ETGD was achieved in 36 patients (84%) without any serious procedure-related complications. A clinically favorable response for ETGD was seen in 35 patients (97%). In 7 patients in whom ETGD was unsuccessful and 1 patient in which it was ineffective, a percutaneous transhepatic approach was performed with severe hemorrhage biloma in the former and uncontrolled hemorrhage cholecystitis, leading to death in the latter. LIMITATIONS: Difficulty of maneuvering the guidewire and drainage tube into the gallbladder. CONCLUSIONS: Although comparative studies are needed to define the appropriate role of ETGD and percutaneous transhepatic approach, ETGD can be useful in patients with acute cholecystitis in which a percutaneous transhepatic approach is contraindicated or anatomically impossible.","['Itoi, Takao', 'Sofuni, Atsushi', 'Itokawa, Fumihide', 'Tsuchiya, Takayoshi', 'Kurihara, Toshio', 'Ishii, Kentaro', 'Tsuji, Shujiro', 'Ikeuchi, Nobuhito', 'Tsukamoto, Sakiko', 'Takeuchi, Mani', 'Kawai, Takashi', 'Moriyasu, Fuminori']","['Itoi T', 'Sofuni A', 'Itokawa F', 'Tsuchiya T', 'Kurihara T', 'Ishii K', 'Tsuji S', 'Ikeuchi N', 'Tsukamoto S', 'Takeuchi M', 'Kawai T', 'Moriyasu F']","['Current affiliations: Department Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080617,United States,Gastrointest Endosc,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,0010505,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde/instrumentation/*methods', 'Cholecystitis/*diagnostic imaging/*therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Drainage/instrumentation/*methods', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Video Recording']",2008/06/20 09:00,2009/01/07 09:00,['2008/06/20 09:00'],"['2007/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/20 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0016-5107(08)00284-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gie.2008.02.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Gastrointest Endosc. 2008 Sep;68(3):455-60. doi: 10.1016/j.gie.2008.02.052.

One hundred nuclear images were acquired; standard morphometric variables and texture features derived from the co-occurrence matrix were calculated. RESULTS: In T-ALL, nuclei presented higher mean and minimal gray levels and higher local homogeneity and angular second moment but lower entropy values, contrast, diagonal moment and cluster prominence than did nuclei in B-derived ALL. In T-ALL, peripheral blood (PB) leukocyte count showed significant positive correlation with minimal gray level and inverse correlation with nuclear area. In B-ALL, peripheral leukocyte count showed positive correlation with mean fluorescence intensity of CD45. In T-ALL but not in B-ALL, inverse correlation existed among age and PB leukocyte count and mean gray levels, and direct correlation existed with nuclear area and mean optical density.

UC is an autoimmune disease, which may present a wider spectrum of cancers. We wanted to examine the risk of cancer in a large population of UC patients in order to reach high statistical power. A UC research database was constructed by identifying UC patients from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and cancer patients from the Cancer Registry. Follow-up of 27,606 UC patients hospitalized for the first time during the years 1964-2004 identified 2,058 patients with cancer. Standardized incidence ratios were calculated for cancer in UC patients by comparing to subjects without hospitalization for UC. The novel tumor sites in UC patients included small intestinal (carcinoid), pancreatic, breast and prostate cancers, nonthyroid endocrine gland tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. A total of 11 sites showed an increased risk, which remained at 6 sites when tumors diagnosed in the year of UC hospitalization were excluded; even chronic myeloid leukemia was in excess. Cancer risks depended on the age at first hospitalization for UC. The SIRs for colon, rectal, liver and pancreatic cancers declined by age at hospitalization for UC, while for endocrine tumors the older patients were at higher risk. Our large study identified novel subsequent cancers in UC patients. However, some of these, including small intestinal carcinoids, prostate cancers and nonthyroid endocrine tumors, may be in excess because of intensified medical surveillance of the patients.","['Hemminki, Kari', 'Li, Xinjun', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Sundquist, Kristina']","['Hemminki K', 'Li X', 'Sundquist J', 'Sundquist K']","['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Im Neuenheimer Feld 580, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. k.hemminki@dkfz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Colitis, Ulcerative/*complications', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23666 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Sep 15;123(6):1417-21. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23666.,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this article is to study the prognostic significance of local lymph node involvement in pediatric RCC and the role of retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RLND) at diagnosis. PROCEDURE: The series included 16 patients with RCC and lymph nodes involvement registered in the Italian Rare Tumors Pediatric Age (TREP) project, accounting for 26.2% of 61 pediatric RCC observed at AIEOP centers. RESULTS: A radical nephrectomy was performed in all cases: at diagnosis in 12 cases, after preoperative chemotherapy (CT) in 4 cases. As a part of the same procedure 9 patients underwent RLND, and 7 received a more limited lymph nodes resection. Five (31.2%) developed disease recurrence 2-34 months after diagnosis (median, 6 months) plus 1 developed progression; 6 patients died, 1 of them from secondary leukemia. Among the nine patients receiving RLND, eight are alive and disease free. This compares with only one patient surviving among the seven receiving a more limited lymph nodes resection. The estimated 25-year PFS and OS rates for all patients were 61.4% (95% CI 33.2-80.5) and 50.8% (95% CI 16.5-77.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Lymph node involvement is an unfavorable prognostic factor in children with RCC. RLND appears to be a critical factor to improve the outcome. However, when compared to similar adult patients, the outcome in children appears to be better, suggesting that pediatric RCC, or the host, may be critical differences.","['Indolfi, Paolo', 'Bisogno, Gianni', 'Cecchetto, Giovanni', 'Spreafico, Filippo', 'De Salvo, Gian Luca', 'Collini, Paola', 'Jenkner, Alessandro', 'Inserra, Alessandro', 'Schiavetti, Amalia', 'di Martino, Martina', 'Casale, Fiorina']","['Indolfi P', 'Bisogno G', 'Cecchetto G', 'Spreafico F', 'De Salvo GL', 'Collini P', 'Jenkner A', 'Inserra A', 'Schiavetti A', 'di Martino M', 'Casale F']","['Pediatric Oncology Service, Pediatric Department, Second University of Napoli, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*pathology/surgery/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Italy', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/pathology', 'Male', 'Nephrectomy', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/30 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.21652 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2008 Oct;51(4):475-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.21652.,,,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Mar;52(3):430.

On day 20 after the start of chemotherapy, right lower abdominal pain and rebound tenderness developed, with a high fever. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showed a semicircular perfusion defect in the ileum. Thus, we performed partial resection of the ileum with primary anastomosis. Macroscopically, the ileum had mucosal ulcerations. Microscopically, there was transmural necrosis with microperforation and Aspergillus invading necrotic tissue and blood vessels. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 14 days after the procedure. Intestinal aspergillosis is rare and associated with high mortality. Thus, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of neutropenic patients with sudden abdominal pain and fever.","['Enjoji, Megumu', 'Ohtsukasa, Shunroh', 'Nagano, Hiroto', 'Matsuki, Moriyuki', 'Kawachi, Yasuyuki', 'Kurisu, Akane', 'Maruyama, Hiroshi', 'Kusakabe, Manabu', 'Nagata, Kaoru', 'Hamaguchi, Hiroyuki', 'Taki, Kazuhiro']","['Enjoji M', 'Ohtsukasa S', 'Nagano H', 'Matsuki M', 'Kawachi Y', 'Kurisu A', 'Maruyama H', 'Kusakabe M', 'Nagata K', 'Hamaguchi H', 'Taki K']","['Department of Surgery, Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Musashino, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080430,Japan,Surg Today,Surgery today,9204360,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Aspergillosis/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Ileal Diseases/*microbiology/surgery', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Intestinal Perforation/*microbiology/surgery', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2007/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00595-007-3639-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Surg Today. 2008;38(5):449-52. doi: 10.1007/s00595-007-3639-9.

Many mammalian RNases are not potent toxins due to the strong inhibition by ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) presented in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In search of new effective anticancer RNases we studied the effects of barnase, a ribonuclease from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, on human cancer cells. We found that barnase is resistant to RI. In MTT cell viability assay, barnase was cytotoxic to human carcinoma cell lines with half-inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)) ranging from 0.2 to 13 microM and to leukemia cell lines with IC(50) values ranging from 2.4 to 82 microM. Also, we characterized the cytotoxic effects of barnase-based immunoRNase scFv 4D5-dibarnase, which consists of two barnase molecules serially fused to the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) of humanized antibody 4D5 that recognizes the extracellular domain of cancer marker HER2. The scFv 4D5-dibarnase specifically bound to HER2-positive cells and was internalized via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The intracellular localization of internalized scFv 4D5-dibarnase was determined by electronic microscopy. The cytotoxic effect of scFv 4D5-dibarnase on HER2-positive human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) was three orders of magnitude greater than that of barnase alone. Both barnase and scFv 4D5-dibarnase induced apoptosis in SKOV-3 cells accompanied by internucleosomal chromatin fragmentation, membrane blebbing, the appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane, and the activation of caspase-3. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results demonstrate that barnase is a potent toxic agent for targeting to cancer cells.","['Edelweiss, Evelina', 'Balandin, Taras G', 'Ivanova, Julia L', 'Lutsenko, Gennady V', 'Leonova, Olga G', 'Popenko, Vladimir I', 'Sapozhnikov, Alexander M', 'Deyev, Sergey M']","['Edelweiss E', 'Balandin TG', 'Ivanova JL', 'Lutsenko GV', 'Leonova OG', 'Popenko VI', 'Sapozhnikov AM', 'Deyev SM']","['Shemyakin and Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia. edelweiss.evelina@gmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080618,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.27.- (Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ribonuclease)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bacterial Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/*drug effects/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002434 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jun 18;3(6):e2434. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002434.,,,PMC2413406,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attachment of the transferrin receptor YTRF internalization motif to a truncated G-CSFR form from a patient with SCN/AML corrected defective internalization, but not receptor degradation suggesting that receptor internalization and degradation occur independently via distinct domains and/or processes. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that distinct domains within the G-CSFR mediate separate processes for receptor internalization and degradation. Our findings using standard binding assays differ from recently published data utilizing flow cytometry.","['Hunter, Melissa G', 'McLemore, Morgan', 'Link, Daniel C', 'Loveland, Megan', 'Copelan, Alexander', 'Avalos, Belinda R']","['Hunter MG', 'McLemore M', 'Link DC', 'Loveland M', 'Copelan A', 'Avalos BR']","['Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080618,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'COS Cells', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA Primers', '*Endocytosis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/21 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/21 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0002452 [doi]'],epublish,PLoS One. 2008 Jun 18;3(6):e2452. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0002452.,,"['R01-CA75226/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21-DK068639/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA82859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 DK068639/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2409964,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Notch-1 can increase nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) activity through a variety of mechanisms. Overexpression of cleaved Notch-1 in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells activates NF-kappaB via interaction with the I kappa B kinase (IKK) signalosome. Concomitant activation of the Notch and NF-kappaB pathways has been described in a large series of cervical cancer specimens. Here, we show that wild-type, spontaneously expressed Notch-1 stimulates NF-kappaB activity in CaSki cervical cancer cells by associating with the IKK signalosome through IKKalpha. A significant fraction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-stimulated IkappaB kinase activity in CaSki cells is Notch-1-dependent. In addition, Notch-1 is found in the nucleus in association with IKKalpha at IKKalpha-stimulated promoters and is required for association of IKKalpha with these promoters under basal and TNF-alpha-stimulated conditions. Notch-1-IKKalpha complexes are found in normal human keratinocytes as well, suggesting that IKK regulation is a physiological function of Notch-1. Both Notch-1 and IKKalpha knockdown sensitize CaSki cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis to equivalent extents. Our data indicate that Notch-1 regulates NF-kappaB in cervical cancer cells at least in part via cytoplasmic and nuclear IKK-mediated pathways.","['Song, L L', 'Peng, Y', 'Yun, J', 'Rizzo, P', 'Chaturvedi, V', 'Weijzen, S', 'Kast, W M', 'Stone, P J B', 'Santos, L', 'Loredo, A', 'Lendahl, U', 'Sonenshein, G', 'Osborne, B', 'Qin, J-Z', 'Pannuti, A', 'Nickoloff, B J', 'Miele, L']","['Song LL', 'Peng Y', 'Yun J', 'Rizzo P', 'Chaturvedi V', 'Weijzen S', 'Kast WM', 'Stone PJ', 'Santos L', 'Loredo A', 'Lendahl U', 'Sonenshein G', 'Osborne B', 'Qin JZ', 'Pannuti A', 'Nickoloff BJ', 'Miele L']","['Breast Cancer Program, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080616,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH4 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Receptor, Notch4)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase/genetics/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch4', 'Receptors, Notch/metabolism', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/11 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['onc2008190 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.190 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2008 Oct 2;27(44):5833-44. doi: 10.1038/onc.2008.190.

We investigated the mechanisms of sanguinarine on the induction of apoptosis using U937 leukemia cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity was evaluated by MTT assay. Apoptosis was detected using DAPI staining, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. The protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis. Caspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric assay. RESULTS: Exposure of U937 cells to sanguinarine resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis by sanguinarine treatment was associated with the activation of caspase-3 and degradation of poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and phospholipase C-gamma 1 protein. Induction of apoptosis by sanguinarine was also accompanied by upregulation of pro-apoptotic Bax and downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression. Sanguinarine-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis were significantly attenuated in Bcl-2-overexpressing U937/Bcl-2 cells. Furthermore, a caspase-3-specific inhibitor blocked caspase-3 activation as well as PARP degradation, and increased the survival rate of sanguinarine-treated U937 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis by sanguinarine in U937 cells was associated with altering the balance of Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression and activation of the caspase-3 pathway.","['Han, Min Ho', 'Yoo, Young Hyun', 'Choi, Yung Hyun']","['Han MH', 'Yoo YH', 'Choi YH']","['Department of Biomaterial Control (BK21 Program), Dongeui University Graduate School, Busan, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080618,Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Benzophenanthridines)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'AV9VK043SS (sanguinarine)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzophenanthridines/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/*metabolism', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Down-Regulation/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*pharmacology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2007/03/30 00:00 [received]', '2007/11/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['000140359 [pii]', '10.1159/000140359 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2008;54(3):157-65. doi: 10.1159/000140359.

We show that in cell lines p27 expression is inversely correlated with expression of SKP2, the F-box protein of SCF(SKP2) (SKP1/Cul1/F-box), the E3 ubiquitin ligase that promotes proteasomal degradation of p27. Inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase causes G(1) arrest, down-regulation of SKP2, and accumulation of p27. Ectopic expression of wild-type SKP2, but not a mutant unable to recognize p27, partially rescues cell-cycle progression. A similar regulation pattern is seen in cell lines transformed by FLT3-ITD, JAK2(V617F), and TEL-PDGFRbeta, suggesting that the SKP2/p27 conduit may be a universal target for leukemogenic tyrosine kinases. Mice that received transplants of BCR-ABL-infected SKP2(-/-) marrow developed a myeloproliferative syndrome but survival was significantly prolonged compared with recipients of BCR-ABL-expressing SKP2(+/+) marrow. SKP2(-/-) leukemic cells demonstrated higher levels of nuclear p27 than SKP2(+/+) counterparts, suggesting that the attenuation of leukemogenesis depends on increased p27 expression. Our data identify SKP2 as a crucial mediator of BCR-ABL-induced leukemogenesis and provide the first in vivo evidence that SKP2 promotes oncogenesis.

They activate many of the same signal transduction pathways. To identify the critical target genes required for transformation in hematopoietic cells, we used a comparative gene expression strategy in which selective small molecules were applied to 32Dcl3 cells that had been transformed to factor-independent growth by these respective oncogenic alleles. We identified inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (Id1), a gene involved in development, cell cycle, and tumorigenesis, as a common target of these oncogenic kinases. These findings were prospectively confirmed in cell lines and primary bone marrow cells engineered to express the respective tyrosine kinase alleles and were also confirmed in vivo in murine models of disease. Moreover, human AML cell lines Molm-14 and K562, which express the FLT3-ITD and BCR-ABL tyrosine kinases, respectively, showed high levels of Id1 expression. Antisense and siRNA based knockdown of Id1-inhibited growth of these cells associated with increased p27(Kip1) expression and increased sensitivity to Trail-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that Id1 is an important target of constitutively activated tyrosine kinases and may be a therapeutic target for leukemias associated with oncogenic tyrosine kinases.","['Tam, Winnie F', 'Gu, Ting-Lei', 'Chen, Jing', 'Lee, Benjamin H', 'Bullinger, Lars', 'Frohling, Stefan', 'Wang, Andrew', 'Monti, Stefano', 'Golub, Todd R', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Tam WF', 'Gu TL', 'Chen J', 'Lee BH', 'Bullinger L', 'Frohling S', 'Wang A', 'Monti S', 'Golub TR', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Hematology Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080617,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (ID1 protein, human)', '0 (Idb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'E1IO3ICJ9A (tandutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics/physiology', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/etiology/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncogenes', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Quinazolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Signal Transduction']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49633-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-07-103010 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1981-92. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-07-103010.

We examined whether RAS mutations impact response to cytarabine in vivo. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-five patients with AML achieving complete remission on Cancer and Leukemia Group B study 8525 and randomly assigned to one of three doses of cytarabine postremission were screened for RAS mutations. We assessed the impact of cytarabine dose on cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of patients with (mutRAS) and without (wild-type; wtRAS) RAS mutations. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (18%) had RAS mutations. With 12.9 years median follow-up, the 10-year CIR was similar for mutRAS and wtRAS patients (65% v 73%; P = .31). However, mutRAS patients receiving high-dose cytarabine consolidation (HDAC; 3 g/m(2) every 12 hours on days 1, 3, and 5 or 400 mg/m(2)/d x 5 days) had the lowest 10-year CIR, 45%, compared with 68% for wtRAS patients receiving HDAC and 80% and 100%, respectively, for wtRAS and mutRAS patients receiving low-dose cytarabine (LDAC; 100 mg/m(2)/d x 5 days; overall comparison, P < .001). Multivariable analysis revealed an interaction of cytarabine dose and RAS status (P = .06). After adjusting for this interaction and cytogenetics (core binding factor [CBF] AML v non-CBF AML), wtRAS patients receiving HDAC had lower relapse risk than wtRAS patients receiving LDAC (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.67; P = .04); however, mutRAS patients receiving HDAC had greater reduction in relapse risk (HR = 0.28; P = .002) compared with mutRAS patients treated with LDAC. CONCLUSION: AML patients carrying mutRAS benefit from higher cytarabine doses more than wtRAS patients. This seems to be the first example of an activating oncogene mutation favorably modifying response to higher drug doses in AML.","['Neubauer, Andreas', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Paschka, Peter', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Liu, Edison T', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Neubauer A', 'Maharry K', 'Mrozek K', 'Thiede C', 'Marcucci G', 'Paschka P', 'Mayer RJ', 'Larson RA', 'Liu ET', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Department for Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080616,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Remission Induction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Survival Rate']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.14.0418 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.14.0418 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;26(28):4603-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.14.0418.

PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 196 adults younger than 60 years with newly diagnosed primary CN-AML, who were treated similarly on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols 9621 and 19808, for WT1 mutations in exons 7 and 9. The patients also were assessed for the presence of FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD), MLL partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations, and for the expression levels of ERG and BAALC. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients (10.7%) harbored WT1 mutations. Complete remission rates were not significantly different between patients with WT1 mutations and those with unmutated WT1 (P = .36; 76% v 84%). Patients with WT1 mutations had worse disease-free survival (DFS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 13% v 50%) and overall survival (OS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 10% v 56%) than patients with unmutated WT1. In multivariable analyses, WT1 mutations independently predicted worse DFS (P = .009; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7) when controlling for CEBPA mutational status, ERG expression level, and FLT3-ITD/NPM1 molecular-risk group (ie, FLT3-ITD(negative)/NPM1(mutated) as low risk v FLT3-ITD(positive) and/or NPM1(wild-type) as high risk). WT1 mutations also independently predicted worse OS (P < .001; HR = 3.2) when controlling for CEBPA mutational status, FLT3-ITD/NPM1 molecular-risk group, and white blood cell count. CONCLUSION: We report the first evidence that WT1 mutations independently predict extremely poor outcome in intensively treated, younger patients with CN-AML. Future trials should include testing for WT1 mutations as part of molecularly based risk assessment and risk-adapted treatment stratification of patients with CN-AML.","['Paschka, Peter', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Whitman, Susan P', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Maharry, Kati', 'Langer, Christian', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Caligiuri, Michael A', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Paschka P', 'Marcucci G', 'Ruppert AS', 'Whitman SP', 'Mrozek K', 'Maharry K', 'Langer C', 'Baldus CD', 'Zhao W', 'Powell BL', 'Baer MR', 'Carroll AJ', 'Caligiuri MA', 'Kolitz JE', 'Larson RA', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080616,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/22 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/22 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.2058 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.2058 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 1;26(28):4595-602. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.2058.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared the long-term outcome of patients with MDS treated with EPO plus G-CSF (n = 121) with untreated patients (n = 237) with MDS using multivariate Cox regression with delayed entry, for the first time adjusting for all major prognostic variables (WHO classification, karyotype, cytopenias, level of transfusion-need, age, and sex). RESULTS: The erythroid response rate to EPO plus G-CSF was 39%, and the median response duration 23 months (range, 3 to 116+). In the multivariate analysis, treatment was associated with improved overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.83; P = .002). Interestingly, this positive association was primarily observed in patients requiring fewer than 2 units of RBCs per month. Treatment was not linked to the rate of acute myeloid leukemia in any defined subgroup, including patients with an increase of marrow blasts or an unfavorable karyotype. CONCLUSION: The inherent risk of leukemic evolution in MDS makes the current investigation highly relevant, in light of the recent reports of potential negative effects of EPO treatment on outcome in patients with cancer. We conclude that treatment of anemia in MDS with EPO plus G-CSF may have a positive impact on outcome in patients with no or low transfusion need, while not affecting the risk of leukemic transformation.","['Jadersten, Martin', 'Malcovati, Luca', 'Dybedal, Ingunn', 'Della Porta, Matteo Giovanni', 'Invernizzi, Rosangela', 'Montgomery, Scott M', 'Pascutto, Cristiana', 'Porwit, Anna', 'Cazzola, Mario', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Jadersten M', 'Malcovati L', 'Dybedal I', 'Della Porta MG', 'Invernizzi R', 'Montgomery SM', 'Pascutto C', 'Porwit A', 'Cazzola M', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stockholm, Sweden. martin.jadersten@ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080616,United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Anemia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Erythropoietin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Precancerous Conditions/*drug therapy']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/13 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['JCO.2007.15.4906 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4906 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jul 20;26(21):3607-13. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4906.

We recently reported the first case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) that responded rapidly to combination therapy of bexarotene and interferon (IFN)-alpha2b with complete clinical response. We demonstrated that bexarotene induced apoptosis of the patient's malignant peripheral blood T-cells in vitro. However, our patient developed skin and nodal relapse 180 days after starting treatment. We now demonstrate that his peripheral blood malignant T cells became resistant to bexarotene-induced apoptosis. We investigated potential mechanisms that may cause aberrations in the retinoid X receptor (RXR) subunits, RXR-alpha and RXR-beta, to account for these findings. Sequence analysis did not reveal acquisition of mutations in the genes encoding RXR-alpha and RXR-beta by resistant cells. We assessed RXR-alpha and RXR-beta expression by Western blot analysis and found that resistant cells had significantly decreased RXR-alpha expression compared with pretherapy bexarotene-sensitive cells.

DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is activated by DNA damage and mediates DNA double-strand break repair. We hypothesized that inhibiting DNA-PK would sensitize CLL cells to drug-induced DNA damage and that this approach could increase the therapeutic index of agents used to treat CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fifty-four CLL cases were characterized for poor prognosis markers [del(17p), del(11q), CD38, and ZAP-70]. In selected cases, DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) expression and activity and p53 function were also measured. Ex vivo viability assays established sensitivity to fludarabine and chlorambucil and also tested the ability of a novel DNA-PK inhibitor (NU7441) to sensitize CLL cells to these drugs. The effects of NU7441 on fludarabine-induced DNA damage repair were also assessed (Comet assays and detection of gammaH2AX). RESULTS: DNA-PKcs levels correlated with DNA-PK activity and varied 50-fold between cases but were consistently higher in del(17p) (P = 0.01) and del(11q) cases. NU7441 sensitized CLL cells to chlorambucil and fludarabine, including cases with del(17p), del(11q), p53 dysfunction, or high levels of DNA-PKcs. NU7441 increased fludarabine-induced double-strand breaks and abrogated drug-induced autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at Ser2056. High DNA-PK levels predicted for reduced treatment-free interval. CONCLUSIONS: These data validate the concept of targeting DNA-PKcs in poor risk CLL, and demonstrate a mechanistic rationale for use of a DNA-PK inhibitor. The novel observation that DNA-PKcs is overexpressed in del(17p) and del(11q) cases indicates that DNA-PK may contribute to disease progression in CLL.","['Willmore, Elaine', 'Elliott, Sarah L', 'Mainou-Fowler, Tryfonia', 'Summerfield, Geoffrey P', 'Jackson, Graham H', ""O'Neill, Fran"", 'Lowe, Christopher', 'Carter, Anthony', 'Harris, Robert', 'Pettitt, Andrew R', 'Cano-Soumillac, Celine', 'Griffin, Roger J', 'Cowell, Ian G', 'Austin, Caroline A', 'Durkacz, Barbara W']","['Willmore E', 'Elliott SL', 'Mainou-Fowler T', 'Summerfield GP', 'Jackson GH', ""O'Neill F"", 'Lowe C', 'Carter A', 'Harris R', 'Pettitt AR', 'Cano-Soumillac C', 'Griffin RJ', 'Cowell IG', 'Austin CA', 'Durkacz BW']","['Northern Institute for Cancer Research, Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom.

However, little attention has been paid to remnant cell-associated domains created by cleavage of EGFR ligands. The present study focused on recent findings that cleavage of membrane-anchored heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (proHB-EGF), an EGFR ligand, induces translocation of the carboxyl-terminal fragment (CTF) of HB-EGF from the plasma membrane to the nucleus and regulates cell cycle. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Two gastric cancer cell lines, MKN28 and NUGC4, were used. KB-R7785, an inhibitor of proHB-EGF shedding, was used to suppress HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation with cetuximab, which inhibits EGFR phosphorylation. Cell growth was analyzed using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium, inner salt assay, apoptosis was evaluated by assay of caspase-3 and caspase-7, and cell cycle was investigated by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence study confirmed that KB-R7785 inhibited HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation under conditions of proHB-EGF shedding induction by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate in gastric cancer cells. KB-R7785 inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner and high-dose KB-R7785 induced apoptosis. Moreover, KB-R7785 induced cell cycle arrest and increased sub-G1 DNA content. KB-R7785 suppressed cyclin A and c-Myc expression. All effects of KB-R7785 were reinforced by combination with cetuximab. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and inhibition of HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation play crucial roles in inhibitory regulation of cancer cell growth. Suppression of HB-EGF-CTF nuclear translocation might offer a new strategy for treating gastric cancer.","['Shimura, Takaya', 'Kataoka, Hiromi', 'Ogasawara, Naotaka', 'Kubota, Eiji', 'Sasaki, Makoto', 'Tanida, Satoshi', 'Joh, Takashi']","['Shimura T', 'Kataoka H', 'Ogasawara N', 'Kubota E', 'Sasaki M', 'Tanida S', 'Joh T']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Metabolism, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KB R7785)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (EGFR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM12 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM12 protein, human)', 'PQX0D8J21J (Cetuximab)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['ADAM Proteins/metabolism', 'ADAM12 Protein', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cetuximab', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/12/3956 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4794 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;14(12):3956-65. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4794.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Targeting of these progenitors was achieved using transgenic mice in which the avian TVA retroviral receptor was placed under the control of the stem cell leukemia (scl/tal-1) gene promoter and SCL +19 enhancer. RESULTS: Injection of an avian retrovirus encoding polyoma middle T (PyMT), an oncogene that transforms endothelial cells, caused rapid lethality in all SCL-TVA mice but not in control TVA(-) littermates. The infected animals exhibited hemorrhagic foci in several organs. Histopathologic analysis confirmed the presence of hemangiomas and the endothelial origin of the PyMT-transformed cells. Surprisingly, the transformed endothelial cells contained readily detectable numbers of TVA(+) cells. By contrast, normal blood vessels had very few of these cells. The presence of TVA(+) cells in the lesions suggests that the cells originally infected by PyMT retained stem cell characteristics. Further analysis showed that the tumor cells exhibited activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and S6/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, suggesting a mechanism used by PyMT to transform endothelial progenitors in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that this experimental system can specifically deliver oncogenes to vascular endothelial progenitors in vivo and cause a fatal neoplastic disease. This animal model should allow the generation of endothelial cancer stem cells in the natural environment of an immunocompetent animal, thereby enabling the recapitulation of genetic alterations that are responsible for the initiation and progression of human malignancies of endothelial origin.","['Sausville, Justin', 'Molinolo, Alfredo A', 'Cheng, Xiangfei', 'Frampton, Jon', 'Takebe, Naoko', 'Gutkind, J Silvio', 'Feldman, Ricardo A']","['Sausville J', 'Molinolo AA', 'Cheng X', 'Frampton J', 'Takebe N', 'Gutkind JS', 'Feldman RA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (Avian Proteins)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tva receptor)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/*administration & dosage/genetics', 'Avian Proteins/*genetics', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens', 'Endothelial Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'Hemangioma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Models, Animal', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Oncogenes/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/metabolism', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Transgenes']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/12/3948 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5152 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;14(12):3948-55. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5152.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor dasatinib is 325-fold more potent against Bcr-Abl TK than imatinib in vitro, significantly inhibiting wild-type KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta TKs, and is active against cells carrying the mutant KIT-D816V gene. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: In this phase 2, open-label study, the efficacy of dasatinib (140 mg/d) was investigated in 67 patients with various Ph- myeloid disorders, including SM (n = 33; 28 KIT-D816V positive). RESULTS: The overall response rate to dasatinib in patients with SM was 33%. Only two patients, one with SM-myelofibrosis and one with SM-chronic eosinophilic leukemia, achieved complete response (elimination of mastocytosis) lasting for 5 and 16 months, respectively. Both patients were negative for KIT-D816V mutation, had low tryptase levels, abnormal WBC counts, and anemia, and had failed prior therapy with erythropoietin. Additional nine SM patients had symptomatic response, lasting 3 to 18+ months. Complete responses were achieved in two other patients (acute myeloid leukemia and hypereosinophilic syndrome). No responses were observed among patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and primary myelofibrosis. The majority of adverse events were grade 1/2. CONCLUSION: These data show that dasatinib therapy may benefit a selected group of SM patients, primarily by improving their symptoms, but it does not eliminate the disease in the patients with KIT-D816V mutation.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Cortes, Jorge', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pardanani, Animesh', 'Akin, Cem', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Thomas, Deborah', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Verstovsek S', 'Tefferi A', 'Cortes J', ""O'Brien S"", 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pardanani A', 'Akin C', 'Faderl S', 'Manshouri T', 'Thomas D', 'Kantarjian H']","['Leukemia Department, M.

We performed a phase I dose escalation trial of AraC combined with GTI-2040, a 20-mer antisense oligonucleotide shown in preclinical studies to decrease levels of the R2 subunit of ribonucleotide reductase, to determine the maximum tolerated dose in adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-three adults (ages 18-59 years) were enrolled in this dose escalation phase I trial, receiving high-dose AraC twice daily combined with infusional GTI-2040. An ELISA-based assay measured plasma and intracellular concentrations of GTI-2040. R2 protein changes were evaluated by immunoblotting in pretreatment and post-treatment bone marrow samples. RESULTS: The maximum tolerated dose was 5 mg/kg/d GTI-2040 (days 1-6) and 3 g/m2/dose AraC every 12 hours for 8 doses. Neurotoxicity was dose limiting. Eight patients (35%) achieved complete remission. Mean bone marrow intracellular concentration of GTI-2040 were higher at 120 hours than at 24 hours from the start of GTI-2040 (P = 0.002), suggesting intracellular drug accumulation over time. Reductions in bone marrow levels of R2 protein (>50%) were observed at 24 and 120 hours. Higher baseline R2 protein expression (P = 0.03) and reductions after 24 hours of GTI-2040 (P = 0.04) were associated with complete remission.

We recently showed that low OCT-1 activity is a major contributor to suboptimal response in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib. The relevance of OCT-1 activity and efflux pumps in determining intracellular uptake and retention (IUR) of dasatinib was assessed. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of OCT inhibitors on [14C]dasatinib and [14C]imatinib IUR was compared using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from newly diagnosed CML patients. The role of efflux transporters was studied using ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines and relevant inhibitors. RESULTS: Unlike imatinib, there was no significant difference in the dasatinib IUR at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C (P = 0.8), and OCT-1 inhibitors including prazosin did not reduce dasatinib IUR significantly. In CML mononuclear cells, prazosin inhibitable IUR was significantly higher for imatinib than dasatinib (6.38 versus 1.48 ng/200,000 cells; P = 0.002; n = 11). Patients with high OCT-1 activity based on their imatinib uptake had IC50(dasatinib) values equivalent to patients with low OCT-1 activity. Dasatinib IUR was significantly lower in ABCB1-overexpressing cell lines compared with parental cell lines (P < 0.05). PSC833 (ABCB1 inhibitor) significantly increased the dasatinib IUR (P < 0.05) and reduced IC50(dasatinib) (from 100 to 8 nmol/L) in K562-DOX cell line. The ABCG2 inhibitor Ko143 significantly increased dasatinib IUR in ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines and reduced IC(50)(dasatinib). CONCLUSION: Unlike imatinib, dasatinib cellular uptake is not significantly affected by OCT-1 activity, so that expression and function of OCT-1 is unlikely to affect response to dasatinib. Dasatinib is a substrate of both efflux proteins, ABCB1 and ABCG2.","['Hiwase, Devendra K', 'Saunders, Verity', 'Hewett, Duncan', 'Frede, Amity', 'Zrim, Stephanie', 'Dang, Phuong', 'Eadie, Laura', 'To, L Bik', 'Melo, Junia', 'Kumar, Sharad', 'Hughes, Timothy P', 'White, Deborah L']","['Hiwase DK', 'Saunders V', 'Hewett D', 'Frede A', 'Zrim S', 'Dang P', 'Eadie L', 'To LB', 'Melo J', 'Kumar S', 'Hughes TP', 'White DL']","['Division of Haematology, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCG2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Organic Cation Transporter 1)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily G, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Organic Cation Transporter 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperazines/pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Temperature', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/12/3881 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5095 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;14(12):3881-8. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5095.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed 494 tissues from 186 acute adulthood leukemias, 30 multiple myelomas, and 278 common solid cancers, including 90 breast, 47 gastric, 47 colon, 47 lung, and 47 hepatocellular carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. RESULTS: Overall, we found six JAK1 mutations (four in acute leukemias, one in a lung carcinoma, and one in a breast carcinoma) and three JAK3 mutations (two in breast carcinomas and one in a gastric carcinoma). Of note, three JAK1 mutations were an identical p.V658F mutation, which is homologous to JAK2 p.V617F mutation. We also found two other JAK1 mutations that occurred at very close sites (p.T782M and p.L783F). We found three of the four leukemias with JAK1 mutations expressed mutated JAK1 at the mRNA level. For JAK3 mutations, one of them was JAK3 p.V715I that is homologous to the JAK1 p.L783F. These recurrent mutations in identical and homologous sites suggest a possibility that alterations of these amino acids might be important for tumor pathogenesis. With respect to the cancer types, T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) showed the highest incidence of the mutations (3 of 11; 27.3%). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that both JAK1 and JAK3 mutations occur in common human cancers and that JAK1 mutation in T-ALL is a frequent event. The data suggest that some of the JAK1 and JAK3 mutations may to be functional and contributes to cancer development, especially to T-ALL development.","['Jeong, Eun Goo', 'Kim, Min Sung', 'Nam, Hyo Kyung', 'Min, Chang Ki', 'Lee, Seok', 'Chung, Yeun Jun', 'Yoo, Nam Jin', 'Lee, Sug Hyung']","['Jeong EG', 'Kim MS', 'Nam HK', 'Min CK', 'Lee S', 'Chung YJ', 'Yoo NJ', 'Lee SH']","['Department of Pathology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Carcinoma/*genetics', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*genetics', 'Janus Kinase 3/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms/genetics', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['14/12/3716 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4839 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;14(12):3716-21. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-4839.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematologic disorders such as aplastic anemia and leukemia induced by chloramphenicol are a major concern. However, the mechanism underlying chloramphenicol-induced leukemogenesis is not known. By investigating the effects of chloramphenicol on the activation of mouse T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibody or staphylococcal enterotoxin B, we found that chloramphenicol induces the differentiation of activated T cells into lymphoblastic leukemia-like cells, characterized by large cell size, multiploid nuclei, and expression of CD7, a maker for immature T cells and T-cell lymphocytic leukemia, thus phenotypically indicating differentiation toward leukemogenesis. High expression of cyclin B1, but not p53, c-myc, and CDC25A, was detected in chloramphenicol-treated activated T cells, which may relate to abnormal cell differentiation. Chloramphenicol inhibited the activation-induced cell death of mouse and human T-cell receptor-activated T cells by down-regulating the expression of Fas ligand. Our findings show that abnormal cell differentiation and inhibition of apoptosis may contribute to the development of leukemia associated with clinical applications of chloramphenicol.","['Yuan, Zeng-Rong', 'Shi, Yufang']","['Yuan ZR', 'Shi Y']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Ccnb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin B)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '66974FR9Q1 (Chloramphenicol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Chloramphenicol/*pharmacology', 'Cyclin B/metabolism', 'Cyclin B1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*chemically induced/*pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/12/4875 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6061 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;68(12):4875-81. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-6061.,,"['AI43384/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reports have shown that Tax, a human T-cell leukemia virus type I encoded protein that has been associated with genomic instability and perturbation of transcription and cell cycle, sensitizes HeLa cells to UV treatment. The extent to which Tax can sensitize cells and the mechanism by which it exerts its effect are unknown. In this study, we show that Tax sensitizes p53-mutant cells to a broad range of DNA-damaging agents, including mitomycin C, a bifunctional alkylator, etoposide, a topoisomerase II drug, and UV light, but not ionizing radiation, a double-strand break agent, or vinblastine, a tubulin poison. Tax caused hypersensitivity in all p53-deleted cell lines and several, but not all, mutant-expressed p53-containing cell lines, while unexpectedly being protective in p53 wild-type (wt) cells. The effect observed in p53-deleted lines could be reversed for this by transfection of wt p53. We also show that Tax activates a p53-independent proapoptotic program through decreased expression of the retinoblastoma protein and subsequent increased E2F1 expression. The expression of several proapoptotic proteins was also induced by Tax, including Puma and Noxa, culminating in a substantial increase in Bax dimerization. Our results show that Tax can sensitize p53-mutant cells to DNA damage while protecting p53 wt cells, a side benefit that might result in reduced toxicity in normal cells. Such studies hold the promise of a novel adjunctive therapy that could make cancer chemotherapy more effective.","['Mihaylova, Valia T', 'Green, Allison M', 'Khurgel, Moshe', 'Semmes, Oliver J', 'Kupfer, Gary M']","['Mihaylova VT', 'Green AM', 'Khurgel M', 'Semmes OJ', 'Kupfer GM']","['Departments of Microbiology, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (PUMA protein, mouse)', '0 (Pmaip1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (tax protein, Human T-lymphotrophic virus 1)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Dimerization', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Vinblastine/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/12/4843 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5070 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;68(12):4843-52. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-07-5070.,,"['R01 HL063776-09/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008136/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC5939382,['NIHMS130458'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that SRPK2 binds and phosphorylates acinus, an SR protein essential for RNA splicing, and redistributes it from the nuclear speckles to the nucleoplasm, resulting in cyclin A1 but not A2 up-regulation. Acinus S422D, an SRPK2 phosphorylation mimetic, enhances cyclin A1 transcription, whereas acinus S422A, an unphosphorylatable mutant, blocks the stimulatory effect of SRPK2. Ablation of acinus or SRPK2 abrogates cyclin A1 expression in leukemia cells and arrest cells at G(1) phase. Overexpression of acinus or SRPK2 increases leukemia cell proliferation. Furthermore, both SRPK2 and acinus are overexpressed in some human acute myelogenous leukemia patients and correlate with elevated cyclin A1 expression levels, fitting with the oncogenic activity of cyclin A1 in leukemia. Thus, our findings establish a molecular mechanism by which SR splicing machinery regulates cell cycle and contributes to leukemia tumorigenesis.","['Jang, Sung-Wuk', 'Yang, Seung-Ju', 'Ehlen, Asa', 'Dong, Shaozhong', 'Khoury, Hanna', 'Chen, Jing', 'Persson, Jenny L', 'Ye, Keqiang']","['Jang SW', 'Yang SJ', 'Ehlen A', 'Dong S', 'Khoury H', 'Chen J', 'Persson JL', 'Ye K']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (ACIN1 protein, human)', '0 (CCNA1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (Cyclin A1)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (SRPK2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin A/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclin A1', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Serine/chemistry/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/19 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['68/12/4559 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0021 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2008 Jun 15;68(12):4559-70. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0021.,,"['R01 NS045627/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045627-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS060680/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS060680-01A2/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2805021,['NIHMS166112'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms regulating ion channel expression in cancer cells are still poorly known. K(+) channels that belong to the human ether-a-go-go-related gene 1 (herg1) family are frequently misexpressed in cancer cells compared to their healthy counterparts. We describe here a posttranslational mechanism for the regulation of hERG1 channel surface expression in cancer cells. This mechanism is based on the activity of hERG1 isoforms containing the USO exon. These isoforms (i) are frequently overexpressed in human cancers, (ii) are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and (iii) form heterotetramers with different proteins of the hERG family. (iv) The USO-containing heterotetramers are retained intracellularly and undergo ubiquitin-dependent degradation. This process results in decreased hERG1 current (I(hERG1)) density. We detailed such a mechanism in heterologous systems and confirmed its functioning in tumor cells that endogenously express hERG1 proteins. The silencing of USO-containing hERG1 isoforms induces a higher I(hERG1) density in tumors, an effect that apparently regulates neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells and apoptosis in leukemia cells.","['Guasti, Leonardo', 'Crociani, Olivia', 'Redaelli, Elisa', 'Pillozzi, Serena', 'Polvani, Simone', 'Masselli, Marika', 'Mello, Tommaso', 'Galli, Andrea', 'Amedei, Amedeo', 'Wymore, Randy S', 'Wanke, Enzo', 'Arcangeli, Annarosa']","['Guasti L', 'Crociani O', 'Redaelli E', 'Pillozzi S', 'Polvani S', 'Masselli M', 'Mello T', 'Galli A', 'Amedei A', 'Wymore RS', 'Wanke E', 'Arcangeli A']","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, Viale G.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate that a Cox proportional hazard model with a hazard ratio parameter is equivalent to a Cox proportional hazard model with a parameter equal to the probability that a patient given one treatment will have an event earlier than if the same patient were given a different treatment. This probability will subsequently be referred to as theta. Clinically interesting differences between the treatment arms are easier for researchers to quantify in terms of in situations where they have a difficult time with the hazard ratio, allowing better communication between the statistician and the researcher. METHODS: The problem and its solution are demonstrated mathematically. The utility of the Cox proportional hazard model in terms of theta is illustrated through a Lymphoma clinical trial example. RESULTS: The Cox proportional hazard model with parameter theta is shown to be equivalent to the Cox proportional hazard model with a hazard ratio parameter Delta. A table of typical hazard ratios Delta is presented with their equivalent theta values. In the appendix the mathematical derivations are developed and an unbiased estimate of theta is provided using Gehan's [2] generalization of the Wilcoxon statistic. LIMITATIONS: The equivalence of the Cox proportional hazard model in terms of the probability theta and the hazard ratio Delta is established only for continuous failure times with a single binary covariate. Conditions under which approximate equivalence holds with multiple covariates are discussed in the Appendix. CONCLUSIONS: The probability theta provides a natural parameterization for the Cox proportional hazard model, affords a tool to conceptualize treatment differences, and provides a method to improve communication between statisticians and researchers.","['Moser, Barry K', 'McCann, Melinda H']","['Moser BK', 'McCann MH']","['Cancer and Leukemia Group B Statistical Center, Duke University Medical Center, Cancer Center Biostatistics and Information Systems, Durham, NC 27710, USA. moser004@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'CHOP protocol']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prednisone/therapeutic use', '*Proportional Hazards Models', 'Research Design', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/29 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/29 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['5/3/248 [pii]', '10.1177/1740774508091452 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Trials. 2008;5(3):248-52. doi: 10.1177/1740774508091452.,,['CA 33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Clin Trials. 2008;5(6):641-2.

Lack of response and resistance to therapies targeting ErbB receptors occur and are often associated with activation of the IGF-1R pathway. Combinations of agents that inhibit IGF-1R and ErbB receptors have been shown to synergistically block cancer cell proliferation and xenograft tumor growth. To determine the mechanism by which targeting both IGF-1R and ErbB receptors causes synergistic effects on cell growth and survival, we investigated the effects of combinations of selective IGF-1R and ErbB kinase inhibitors on proliferative and apoptotic signaling. We identified A431 squamous cell carcinoma cells as most sensitive to combinations of ErbB and IGF-1R inhibitors. The inhibitor combinations resulted in not only blockade of A431 cell proliferation, but also induced apoptosis, which was not seen with either agent alone. Upon examining phosphorylation states and expression levels of proteins in the IGF-1R and ErbB signaling pathways, we found a correlation between the ability of combinations to inhibit proliferation and to decrease levels of phosphorylated Akt and cyclin D1. In addition, the massive cell death induced by combined IGF-1R/ErbB inhibition was associated with Mcl-1 reduction and Bax activation. Thus, targeting both IGF-1R and ErbB receptors simultaneously results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through combined effects on Akt, cyclin D1, and Bax activation.","['Wilsbacher, Julie L', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Tucker, Lora A', 'Hubbard, Robert D', 'Sheppard, George S', 'Bamaung, Nwe Y', 'Fidanze, Steve D', 'Wang, Gary T', 'Hu, Xiaoming', 'Davidsen, Steven K', 'Bell, Randy L', 'Wang, Jieyi']","['Wilsbacher JL', 'Zhang Q', 'Tucker LA', 'Hubbard RD', 'Sheppard GS', 'Bamaung NY', 'Fidanze SD', 'Wang GT', 'Hu X', 'Davidsen SK', 'Bell RL', 'Wang J']","['Cancer Research, Global Pharmaceutical Research and Development, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080617,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin D)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-erbB)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, IGF Type 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin D', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Oncogene Proteins v-erbB/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Receptor, IGF Type 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/04 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/04 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49284-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M708360200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 29;283(35):23721-30. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M708360200.

OBJECTIVES: First, to analyze the frequency of neonatal tumours associated with congenital abnormalities; and second, to comment on the likely etiopathogenic hypotheses of a relationship between neonatal tumours and congenital abnormalities. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Historical series of neonatal tumours from La Fe University Children's Hospital in Valencia (Spain), from January 1990 to December 1999. Histological varieties of neonatal tumours and associated congenital abnormalities were described. A systematic review of the last 25 years was carried out using Medline, Cancerlit, Index Citation Science and Embase. The search profile used was the combination of ""neonatal/congenital-tumors/cancer/neoplasms"" and ""congenital malformations/birth defects"". RESULTS: 72 neonatal tumours were identified (2.8% of all pediatric cancers diagnosed in our hospital) and in 15 cases (20.8%) there was some associated malformation, disease or syndrome. The association between congenital abnormalities and neonatal tumours were: a) angiomas in three patients: two patients with congenital heart disease with a choanal stenosis, laryngomalacia; b) neuroblastomas in two patients: horseshoe kidney with vertebral anomalies and other with congenital heart disease; c) teratomas in two patients: one with cleft palate with vertebral anomalies and other with metatarsal varus; d) one tumour of the central nervous system with Bochdaleck hernia; e) heart tumours in four patients with tuberous sclerosis; f) acute leukaemia in one patient with Down syndrome and congenital heart disease; g) kidney tumour in one case with triventricular hydrocephaly, and h) adrenocortical tumour: hemihypertrophy. The publications included the tumours diagnosed in different pediatric periods and without unified criteria to classify the congenital abnormalities. Little data exist on the neonatal period and the majority are from medical institutions registers. The prevalence varies from 15 to 31.6%. To explain this association, the hypotheses are based on prenatal exposures (preconceptional and transplacental exposure), to mutagenic and carcinogenic risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal tumours are more often associated to congenital abnormalities than other pediatric cancers. The inclusion and classification criteria needs to be unified to better understand the association between the neonatal tumours and congenital abnormalities. The environmental history in all neonatal tumours associated to congenital abnormalities, including the constitutional and environmental risk factors, will help to improve our knowledge of the underlying prenatal mechanisms and to an advance in its prevention.","['Berbel Tornero, O', 'Ortega Garcia, J A', 'Ferris i Tortajada, J', 'Garcia Castell, J', 'Donat i Colomer, J', 'Soldin, O P', 'Fuster Soler, J L']","['Berbel Tornero O', 'Ortega Garcia JA', 'Ferris i Tortajada J', 'Garcia Castell J', 'Donat i Colomer J', 'Soldin OP', 'Fuster Soler JL']","['Unidad de Salud Medioambiental Pediatrica, Hospital Materno-Infantil Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Espana. oberbel@ono.com']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,Spain,An Pediatr (Barc),"Anales de pediatria (Barcelona, Spain : 2003)",101162596,,IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/classification/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['13123291 [pii]', '10.1157/13123291 [doi]']",ppublish,An Pediatr (Barc). 2008 Jun;68(6):589-95. doi: 10.1157/13123291.,,['M01 RR020359/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3635533,['NIHMS459185'],Tumores neonatales y malformaciones congenitas.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, diacylglycerol, ceramides and sphingosine, NAD+ and arginine exert this effect by acting as signaling molecules, while carrying out other important cellular functions. Metabolites can also be involved in the control of cell proliferation by directly regulating gene expression in ways that are signaling pathway-independent, e.g. by direct activation of transcription factors or by inducing epigenetic processes. The fact that metabolites can affect the cancer process on so many levels suggests that the change in concentration of some metabolites that occurs in cancer cells could have an active role in the progress of the disease. RESULTS: CoMet, a fully automated Computational Metabolomics method to predict changes in metabolite levels in cancer cells compared to normal references has been developed and applied to Jurkat T leukemia cells with the goal of testing the following hypothesis: Up or down regulation in cancer cells of the expression of genes encoding for metabolic enzymes leads to changes in intracellular metabolite concentrations that contribute to disease progression. All nine metabolites predicted to be lowered in Jurkat cells with respect to lymphoblasts that were examined (riboflavin, tryptamine, 3-sulfino-L-alanine, menaquinone, dehydroepiandrosterone, alpha-hydroxystearic acid, hydroxyacetone, seleno-L-methionine and 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole), exhibited antiproliferative activity that has not been reported before, while only two (bilirubin and androsterone) of the eleven tested metabolites predicted to be increased or unchanged in Jurkat cells displayed significant antiproliferative activity. CONCLUSION: These results: a) demonstrate that CoMet is a valuable method to identify potential compounds for experimental validation, b) indicate that cancer cell metabolism may be regulated to reduce the intracellular concentration of certain antiproliferative metabolites, leading to uninhibited cellular growth and c) suggest that many other endogenous metabolites with important roles in carcinogenesis are awaiting discovery.","['Arakaki, Adrian K', 'Mezencev, Roman', 'Bowen, Nathan J', 'Huang, Ying', 'McDonald, John F', 'Skolnick, Jeffrey']","['Arakaki AK', 'Mezencev R', 'Bowen NJ', 'Huang Y', 'McDonald JF', 'Skolnick J']","['Center for the Study of Systems Biology, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. adrian.arakaki@gatech.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080617,England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', '*Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Design', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/enzymology/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Systems Biology']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['1476-4598-7-57 [pii]', '10.1186/1476-4598-7-57 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2008 Jun 17;7:57. doi: 10.1186/1476-4598-7-57.,,"['R01 GM048835/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-48835/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2453147,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventionally, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), are used as feeder cells to support the growth of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in culture. To prepare for fresh MEF feeder or for MEF-conditioned medium, sacrifice of mouse fetuses repeatedly is unavoidable in these tedious culture systems. Here we report the discovery of a human endothelial cell line (ECV-304 cell line) that efficiently supports growth of mESCs LIF-free conditions. mESCs that were successfully cultured for eight to 20 passages on ECV-304 feeders showed morphological characteristics similar to cells cultured in traditional feeder cell systems. These cells expressed the stem cell markers Oct3/4, Nanog, Sox2, and SSEA-1. Furthermore, cells cultured on the ECV-304 cell line were able to differentiate into three germ layers and were able to generate chimeric mice. Compared with traditional culture systems, there is no requirement for mouse fetuses and exogenous LIF does not need to be added to the culture system. As a stable cell line, the ECV-304 cell line efficiently replaces MEFs as an effective feeder system and allows the efficient expansion of mESCs.","['Zhou, Haisheng', 'Yong, Jun', 'Sun, Xiaomeng', 'Wang, Chengyan', 'Yang, Weifeng', 'Zhang, Pengbo', 'Zhu, Jingliang', 'Shi, Cheng', 'Ding, Mingxiao', 'Deng, Hongkui']","['Zhou H', 'Yong J', 'Sun X', 'Wang C', 'Yang W', 'Zhang P', 'Zhu J', 'Shi C', 'Ding M', 'Deng H']","['Key Laboratory of Cell Proliferation and Differentiation of Ministry of Education, College of Life Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080613,England,Differentiation,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,0401650,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Embryo, Mammalian/*metabolism', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Endothelial Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2009/01/30 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-4681(09)60030-X [pii]', '10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00280.x [doi]']",ppublish,Differentiation. 2008 Nov;76(9):923-30. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-0436.2008.00280.x.

A differentiation protocol was designed using LIF as a maturation cytokine and this was compared with standard and control protocols applied to human MSCs of bone marrow origin. We observed that mesenchymal-derived hepatocyte-like cells (MDHLCs) acquired similar morphological changes when exposed to LIF or to OSM. Using protein and gene expression assays, we noticed a comparable hepatic marker expression in both differentiation conditions. Furthermore, LIF and OSM allowed the acquisition of equivalent levels of hepatocyte-like functionality as attested by evaluation of urea secretion and glycogen deposition. However, no increase in the expression of hepatocyte-like features could be observed in MDHLCs after a combined exposition to LIF and OSM.

Seven cases of DS-acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia (AMKL) were also included, DS-ALL cases showed relatively stable karyotypes with cryptic losses and gains that most frequently involved chromosomes X, 1, 2, 9, 11, 16, and 17. The most consistent change involved a deletion in 2p, spanning region Chr2:88273220-91084234, which in some cases appeared to be homozygous. ALL from non-DS patients showed a similar overall karyotypic stability, although gains of chromosome 21 were infrequent in the ETV6-RUNX1 positive cases.

Here, we investigate whether the safety and efficiency of retroviral gene transfer into HSCs can be improved by using human allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB)-derived supplements instead of fetal bovine serum (FBS). When CD34(+) cells were cultured ex vivo in UCB-derived serum (CBS) or plasma (CBP), comparable or higher maintenance of HSCs was observed than in FBS and serum-free substitution medium (SFM) as assessed by the frequency of positive engraftment and the level of engraftment in NOD/SCID mice after transplantation of cultured cells. CBS and CBP also exhibited higher level stabilization of retroviral particles than SFM during in vitro culture of retrovirus pseudotyped with gibbon ape leukemia virus or vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein. Retroviral gene transfer into CD34(+) cells performed with CBS or CBP resulted in increased gene transfer into CD34(+) cells and increased transduction of reconstituted bone marrow cells compared to transfers with SFM or FBS. The increased transduction of bone marrow cells was associated with a larger number of transduced progenitors in the recipient mice. Significant oligoclonality in the transduced progenitors, as determined by ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction, suggested efficient retroviral targeting of multiple HSCs in the CBS- or CBP-supplemented media. Combined, our results show that allogeneic UCB-derived serum or plasma is a safe and easily accessible serum supplement that can support efficient retroviral gene transfer into HSCs for the clinical-grade manipulation of HSCs.","['Moon, Noory', 'Yang, Seung-Jip', 'Park, Bo-Bae', 'Chung, Yun-Shin', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Oh, Il-Hoan']","['Moon N', 'Yang SJ', 'Park BB', 'Chung YS', 'Lee JW', 'Oh IH']","['Department of Cellular Medicine, Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul 137-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media/chemistry', '*Fetal Blood', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/physiology/virology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics/metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Plasma', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Serum', '*Transduction, Genetic', '*Transplantation, Homologous', 'Viral Envelope Proteins']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/09/18 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/18 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.2007.123 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2008 Jul;19(7):744-52. doi: 10.1089/hum.2007.123.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know.

Here we found that QU induced human leukemia cell death in a dose-dependent manner. However, it did not show a dose-dependent inhibition on ROS generation (indicated by the level of malondialdehyde, MDA) in the same cells. QU showed similar antioxidant activity at concentrations of 50, 75 and 100 microM. Consistent with that, the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) could only further decrease the ROS generation and enhance the cell death triggered by QU at the concentrations less than 50 microM. These results indicate that an additional mechanism is involved in the anticancer activity of high concentrations of QU. When the effect of QU on histone acetylation was studied, QU induced significant histone hyperacetylation at 75 and 100 microM, indicating the possible involvement of histone hyperacetylation in the anticancer activity of high concentrations of QU. This conclusion was supported by the findings that when histone acetylation in the cells treated by QU was increased by different concentrations of TSA, the cell death was significantly enhanced. Our results thus provide the first evidence that QU can induce histone hyperacetylation and this induction of histone hyperacetylation may represent an unrevealed mechanism in its anticancer activity.","['Jia, Jie', 'Chen, Jie']","['Jia J', 'Chen J']","['Shanxi Vocational Poly-tech College, Taiyuan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2008/06/19 09:00,2008/07/23 09:00,['2008/06/19 09:00'],"['2008/06/19 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/19 09:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pharmazie. 2008 May;63(5):379-83.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have devised a PCR-based assay for NPM1 exon 12 mutations using differential melting of an oligo probe labeled with a fluorescent dye. The nucleobase quenching (NBQ) phenomenon was used to detect probe hybridization, and an oligonucleotide containing locked nucleic acid (LNA) nucleotides was used as a PCR clamp to suppress amplification of the normal sequence and enhance the analytical sensitivity of the assay. After the NBQ assay, the specimens with a mutation were removed from the capillary and sequenced to identify the mutation. The use of the LNA clamp facilitates interpretation of the mutant sequence because of the lower intensity of the overlapping normal sequence. Analysis of a series of 70 patient specimens revealed 17 positive for an NPM1 mutation and 53 negatives. All of the NBQ results (positives and negatives) were confirmed with other methods. The analytical sensitivity of the NBQ assay is variable depending on the concentration of the PCR clamp and other parameters. Using a 100 nmol/L concentration of the LNA clamp, NPM1 mutations were detectable in a 10-fold excess of wild-type DNA. This assay may be valuable for screening disease specimens.","['Laughlin, Todd S', 'Becker, Michael W', 'Liesveld, Jane L', 'Mulford, Deborah A', 'Abboud, Camille N', 'Brown, Patrick', 'Rothberg, Paul G']","['Laughlin TS', 'Becker MW', 'Liesveld JL', 'Mulford DA', 'Abboud CN', 'Brown P', 'Rothberg PG']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, 601 Elmwood Avenue, Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080613,United States,J Mol Diagn,The Journal of molecular diagnostics : JMD,100893612,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/genetics', '*Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/09/23 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-1578(10)60170-5 [pii]', '10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070175 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Diagn. 2008 Jul;10(4):338-45. doi: 10.2353/jmoldx.2008.070175.

Flavopiridol is a semisynthetic flavonoid that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and also shows selective lethality against leukemic cells. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and mechanism of action of the combinatorial use of the redox-reactive thalidomide CPS49 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol as a selective antileukemic therapeutic strategy. In combination, CPS49 and flavopiridol were found to induce selective cytotoxicity associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and elevations of ROS in leukemic cells ranging from additive to synergistic activity at low micromolar concentrations. Highest synergy was observed at the level of ROS generation with a strong correlation between cell-specific cytotoxicity and reciprocal coupling of drug-induced ROS elevation with glutathione depletion. Examination of the transcriptional targeting of CPS49 and flavopiridol combinations reveals that the drugs act in concert to initiate a cell specific transcriptional program that manipulates nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), E2F-1, and p73 activity to promote enhanced mitochondrial instability by simultaneously elevating the expression of the proapoptotic factors BAX, BAD, p73, and PUMA while depressing expression of the antiapoptotic genes MCL1, XIAP, BCL-xL, SURVIVIN, and MDM2. The coadministration of CPS49 and flavopiridol acts through coordinate targeting of transcriptional pathways that enforce selective mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS elevation and is therefore a promising new therapeutic combination that warrants further preclinical exploration.","['Ge, Yun', 'Byun, Jung S', 'De Luca, Paola', 'Gueron, Geraldine', 'Yabe, Idalia M', 'Sadiq-Ali, Sara G', 'Figg, William D', 'Quintero, Jesse', 'Haggerty, Cynthia M', 'Li, Quentin Q', 'De Siervi, Adriana', 'Gardner, Kevin']","['Ge Y', 'Byun JS', 'De Luca P', 'Gueron G', 'Yabe IM', 'Sadiq-Ali SG', 'Figg WD', 'Quintero J', 'Haggerty CM', 'Li QQ', 'De Siervi A', 'Gardner K']","['Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-5065, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080612,United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (CPS 49)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Homeostasis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity/drug effects', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/09/19 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['mol.107.040808 [pii]', '10.1124/mol.107.040808 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;74(3):872-83. doi: 10.1124/mol.107.040808.

In vivo studies have shown that the primary oxidative metabolites of dasatinib are M4 (N-dealkylation), M5 (N-oxidation), M6 (carboxylic acid formation), M20, and M24 (hydroxylation). To identify the enzymes responsible for the formation of these metabolites, [(14)C]-dasatinib and nonradiolabeled dasatinib were incubated with human cDNA-expressed enzymes [cytochromes P450 (P450s) and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) 3] or human liver microsome (HLM) in the presence of selective P450 inhibitors (antibodies and chemical inhibitors). The results of these experiments showed that metabolites M4, M20, and M24 were mainly generated by CYP3A4; M5 was primarily formed by FMO3; and M6 was formed by a cytosolic oxidoreductase. The enzyme kinetic analysis showed that the formation of M4 and M5 in HLM followed the Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and the formation data of M20 and M24 fitted well to a partial substrate inhibition kinetic model. The K(m) values were determined by the kinetic analysis of the substrate-dependent metabolite formation plots from a large number of incubations with the nonlabeled dasatinib; the V(max) values were calculated with the predetermined K(m) values and the metabolite formation rates from a limited number of incubations with [(14)C]dasatinib. The intrinsic formation clearance values (V(max)/K(m)) of 52, 14, 274, and 20 microl/mg protein/min for the formation of M4, M5, M20, and M24, respectively, suggested that the formation of M20 was more efficient than other metabolites.

There are different biological subtypes of acute lymphoblastic leukemia with distinct features and prognoses; the distribution of these subtypes is not well known among adolescents. We, therefore, studied acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adolescents and young adults aged 10 to 25 years in Finland. DESIGN AND METHODS: This population-based study included 225 consecutive patients aged 10-25 years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during 1990-2004. One hundred and twenty-eight patients (10-16 years) were treated with pediatric Nordic (NOPHO) protocols, and 97 patients (17-25 years) with Finnish Leukemia Group National protocols. We characterized the biological subtypes, clinical features and outcome of these patients. RESULTS: For the whole cohort, the remission rate was 96%, 5-year event-free survival 62% and overall survival 72%. The 5-year event-free survival was 67% for the pediatric treatment group and 60% for the adult treatment group (p=n.s.). Patients with inferior outcome were those with a white blood cell count >or= 100 x 10(9)/L, the Philadelphia chromosome and MLL. Good prognostic features were TEL-AML1, hyperdiploidy, and pediatric intermediate risk stratification. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike all previous studies, we found that the outcome of adolescents and young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with pediatric or adult therapeutic protocols was comparable. The success of the adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy emphasizes the benefit of central referral of patients to academic centers and adherence to research protocols.","['Usvasalo, Anu', 'Raty, Riikka', 'Knuutila, Sakari', 'Vettenranta, Kim', 'Harila-Saari, Arja', 'Jantunen, Esa', 'Kauppila, Marjut', 'Koistinen, Pirjo', 'Parto, Katriina', 'Riikonen, Pekka', 'Salmi, Toivo T', 'Silvennoinen, Raija', 'Elonen, Erkki', 'Saarinen-Pihkala, Ulla M']","['Usvasalo A', 'Raty R', 'Knuutila S', 'Vettenranta K', 'Harila-Saari A', 'Jantunen E', 'Kauppila M', 'Koistinen P', 'Parto K', 'Riikonen P', 'Salmi TT', 'Silvennoinen R', 'Elonen E', 'Saarinen-Pihkala UM']","['Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, P.O.

Excess alpha-globin precipitates in erythroid progenitor cells resulting in cell death, ineffective erythropoiesis and severe anemia. Decreased alpha-globin synthesis leads to milder symptoms, exemplified in individuals who co-inherit alpha- and beta-thalassemia. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of utilizing short-interfering RNA (siRNA) to mediate reductions in alpha-globin expression. A number of siRNA sequences targeting murine alpha-globin were tested in hemoglobinized murine erythroleukemic cells. One highly effective siRNA sequence (si-alpha 4) was identified and reduced alpha-globin by approximately 65% at both the RNA and the protein level. Electroporation of si-alpha 4 into murine thalassemic primary erythroid cultures restored alpha :beta-globin ratios to balanced wild-type levels and resulted in detectable phenotypic correction.

DESIGN AND METHODS: With the aim of identifying surrogate markers of somatic hypermutation, a combined investigation of IgV(H) mutational status and expression profiles of 93 samples from patients with small B-cell lymphoma was performed. RESULTS: The analysis identified an somatic hypermutation signature of genes involved in the regulation of gene transcription, DNA repair and replication, and chromosome maintenance. Eight of these genes were subjected to protein analysis using tissue microarrays, for a set of 118 cases. We found a clear link between RAD51C and CDK7 protein expression and somatic hypermutation status, in that positive expression of either marker was significantly associated with a mutated status (p<0.003). We also found that positive expression of TFDP1 and POLA was significantly associated with ongoing somatic hypermutation (p<0.001). To assess the potential clinical applicability of these somatic hypermutation markers, we studied a series of cases of mantle cell lymphoma included in a tissue microarray. The expression of RCC1 and CDK7, separately and together, was found to be significantly associated with longer overall survival.

This was demonstrated by looking at the effect of adding a chelating agent-D-penicillamine (D-PEN) to CuSO4 and CuCl2 aqueous solutions as well as to rabbit blood serum. We propose that the measurement of water proton spin-lattice relaxation rate constants before and after chelation may be used as an alternative approach for monitoring the presence of free copper ions in blood serum. This method may be used in the diagnosis of some diseases (leukaemia, liver diseases and particularly Wilson's disease) because, in contrast to conventional methods like spectrophotometry which records the total number of both bound and free ions, the proton relaxation technique is sensitive solely to free paramagnetic ions dissolved in blood serum.

This work reports the cloning and sequencing of a p53-like cDNA in the mollusc bivalve Crassostreagigas. The deduced amino acid sequences of p53 shared a high degree of homology with the homologues from other mollusc species, including typical eukaryotic p53 signature sequences.

To determine whether sympatric carnivores are reservoirs of pathogens posing a disease risk for the lynx, evidence of exposure to 17 viral, bacterial and protozoan agents was investigated in 176 carnivores comprising 26 free-living lynx, 53 domestic cats, 28 dogs, 33 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), 24 Egyptian mongooses (Herpestes ichneumon), 10 common genets (Genetta genetta) and 2 Eurasian badgers (Meles meles) in the areas inhabited by the last two populations of Iberian lynx, both in Andalusia (South-Western Spain). The results indicated that the lynx had low rates of contact with viral pathogens, with one seropositive finding each for feline leukemia virus, parvovirus and canine adenovirus-1, whereas contact with bacteria and protozoa appeared more frequent. Active infections with parvovirus, Ehrlichia spp., Mycobacterium bovis, Leptospira interrogans and Cytauxzoon spp. were confirmed. In contrast, 53% of the domestic cats were exposed to some infectious agent (prevalence range 4.5-11.4%). Antibodies to canine distemper virus and parvovirus were frequently found in dogs (32% and 42%, respectively) and foxes (30% and 12%). Past or present infections with parvovirus, Ehrlichia spp., Chlamydophila spp., M. bovis, Salmonella enterica, L. interrogans, Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum were also detected in these and other species surveyed. Questionnaires to owners revealed that 14% of the dogs but none of the cats had been vaccinated, and no cat had been neutered. Based on the apparent absence of acquired immunity of the lynx against infectious agents, the frequent detection of agents among sympatric carnivores, and the reported lack of immunocompetence of the Iberian lynx, a disease outbreak among the local abundant carnivores may pose a serious disease risk for lynx conservation.","['Millan, Javier', 'Candela, Monica G', 'Palomares, Francisco', 'Cubero, Maria Jose', 'Rodriguez, Alejandro', 'Barral, Marta', 'de la Fuente, Jose', 'Almeria, Sonia', 'Leon-Vizcaino, Luis']","['Millan J', 'Candela MG', 'Palomares F', 'Cubero MJ', 'Rodriguez A', 'Barral M', 'de la Fuente J', 'Almeria S', 'Leon-Vizcaino L']","['Department of Conservation Biology, Estacion Biologica de Donana (CSIC), Sevilla, Spain. syngamustrachea@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080613,England,Vet J,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",9706281,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bacterial Infections/epidemiology/mortality/transmission/*veterinary', 'Cats', '*Conservation of Natural Resources', 'Disease Reservoirs/veterinary', 'Dogs', 'Extinction, Biological', 'Female', 'Foxes', 'Herpestidae', '*Lynx', 'Male', 'Mustelidae', 'Protozoan Infections, Animal/*epidemiology/mortality/transmission', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Virus Diseases/epidemiology/mortality/transmission/*veterinary', 'Viverridae']",2008/06/17 09:00,2009/07/23 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/14 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/07/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S1090-0233(08)00154-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Vet J. 2009 Oct;182(1):114-24. doi: 10.1016/j.tvjl.2008.04.005.

However, very little evidence exists on the impact of such evaluation in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of leukaemia patients. A systematic search of the literature from 1980 to 2007 was undertaken and studies were identified and evaluated independently, according to a pre-defined coding scheme, by three reviewers. Both HRQOL outcomes and traditional clinical reported outcomes were systematically analysed to evaluate their consistency and their relevance for supporting clinical decision making. Nine RCTs were identified, involving 3838 patients overall. There were four RCTs involving acute myeloid leukaemia patients (AML), three with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and two with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Six studies were published after 2000 and provided fairly robust methodological quality. Imatinib greatly improved HRQOL compared to interferon based treatments in CML patients and fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide does not seem to have a deleterious impact on patient's HRQOL when compared to fludarabine alone or chlorambucil in CLL patients. This study revealed the paucity of HRQOL research in leukaemia patients.

The effect of NK alloreactivity in HLA identical SCT is still under debate and in particular in transplantation for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) the data are very limited and with conflicting outcome. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of KIR genes and KIR ligands on leukemia free survival (LFS) and relapse rate in a well-defined, homogeneous group of CML patients phase upon HLA identical sibling SCT. METHODOLOGY: We retrospectively analyzed the effect of KIRs and KIR ligands (C1 and C2) on LFS and relapse in 70 CML patients in 1st chronic phase, who had received an HLA identical sibling graft. For KIR typing we used a single PCR based KIR typing protocol that also included primers allowing for the identification of the KIR binding site on HLA-Cw (AA 77 and 80). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The data show clear differences in transplant outcome between patients having both ligands (C1 and C2) as compared to patients having only one ligand (C1 or C2). In the latter group, the stimulatory KIR2DS5 gene was associated with improved leukemia free survival (p=0.007; hazard ratio 4.3; 95% confidence interval 1.3-6.7) and lower relapse rates (p=0.028; HR 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-9.1). In contrast, in patients carrying both ligands, KIR2DS5 was associated with reduced LFS (p=0.0056; HR 0.3; 95% CI 0.1-0.7) and higher relapse rate (p=0.02; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.1-0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate a role for an NK mediated anti-CML response after HLA identical sibling SCT that is influenced by KIR ligands and, more importantly, by stimulatory KIRs present in the donor.","['van der Meer, Arnold', 'Schaap, Nicolaas P M', 'Schattenberg, Anton V M B', 'van Cranenbroek, Bram', 'Tijssen, Henk J', 'Joosten, Irma']","['van der Meer A', 'Schaap NP', 'Schattenberg AV', 'van Cranenbroek B', 'Tijssen HJ', 'Joosten I']","['Department of Blood Transfusion and Transplantation Immunology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, P.O.

Because of the presence of neutrophilic leukocytosis, aCML may resemble chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, in contrast with the latter, aCML lacks a Philadelphia chromosome or the BCR/ABL fusion gene. The molecular pathogenesis of aCML and its relationship to other myeloproliferative neoplasms is unknown. To clarify these points, the presence of JAK2 V617F was examined by a retrospective analysis of archival specimens obtained from two large medical institutions. Paraffin-embedded bone marrow (BM) trephines and clot sections were examined by an allele-specific TaqMan PCR suitable for use with decalcified tissue. Fifty-nine cases of Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome negative chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (CMPN) and normal bone marrows (BM) served as controls. None of the nine amplifiable cases of aCML and none of the normal BM controls showed a JAK2 V617F mutation, in contrast to 45/59 (76%) of the Ph chromosome negative CMPN cases. Atypical CML should therefore be considered as a JAK2 negative chronic myeloid neoplasm that remains properly categorized, alongside chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia, within the WHO group of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.","['Fend, Falko', 'Horn, Thomas', 'Koch, Ina', 'Vela, Teresa', 'Orazi, Attilio']","['Fend F', 'Horn T', 'Koch I', 'Vela T', 'Orazi A']","['Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Eberhard-Karls-University, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080613,England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Blast Crisis/blood/pathology', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/deficiency/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic, Atypical, BCR-ABL Negative/blood/*classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Mastocytosis/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'World Health Organization']",2008/06/17 09:00,2009/01/10 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/10 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(08)00226-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.024 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2008 Dec;32(12):1931-5. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2008.04.024.

DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENT(S): Thirty reproductive-aged women with submucosal, intramural, or no uterine myomas who underwent hysteroscopy or hysterectomy. INTERVENTION(S): Proliferative phase endometrial sampling was performed at the time of surgery. In uteri with a submucosal myoma, directed endometrial biopsies were obtained over the myoma and over normal myometrium. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Endometrial HOXA10 expression was evaluated as a primary endpoint using quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. HOXA11, BTEB1, and LIF were evaluated using real-time RT-PCR. RESULT(S): Endometrial HOXA10 and HOXA11 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression were significantly decreased in uteri with submucosal myomas compared with controls and with uteri with intramural myomas. A similar trend was seen in BTEB1 mRNA expression; however, no difference was found in LIF mRNA expression. Immunohistochemistry localized the decrease in endometrial HOXA10 protein expression to stroma. In the presence of a submucosal myoma, there were no regional differences in gene expression. CONCLUSION(S): The molecular mechanism by which submucosal myomas adversely affect reproduction includes a global decrease in endometrial HOX gene expression, not simply a focal change over the myoma. This may explain the reproductive dysfunction observed with submucosal myomas.","['Rackow, Beth W', 'Taylor, Hugh S']","['Rackow BW', 'Taylor HS']","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Reproductive Sciences, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8063, USA. beth.rackow@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080613,United States,Fertil Steril,Fertility and sterility,0372772,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (HOXA11 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox A10 Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (KLF9 protein, human)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '140441-81-2 (HOXA10 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Embryo Implantation/physiology', 'Endometrium/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/physiology', 'Homeobox A10 Proteins', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Female/diagnosis/*etiology/genetics/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leiomyoma/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucous Membrane/metabolism/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Uterine Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology']",2008/06/17 09:00,2010/04/17 06:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2007/09/21 00:00 [received]', '2008/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2008/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2010/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0015-0282(08)00600-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.03.029 [doi]']",ppublish,Fertil Steril. 2010 Apr;93(6):2027-34. doi: 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.03.029.

In addition to the immunological and physiological barriers, the existence of numerous porcine microorganisms including viruses poses a risk for xenozoonosis. Three classes of functional gamma-type porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERV) have been identified, whereby functional polytropic PERV-A and PERV-B infect human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) and other cell lines in vitro. In the course of risk assessment for xenotransplantation the capacity of human cells to counteract PERV infections should be analyzed. Primates and other mammals display different means of protection against viral infections. APOBEC3 proteins which are cytidine deaminases and a part of the intrinsic immunity mediate potent activity against a wide range of retroviruses including murine leukemia viruses (MLV). As PERV and MLV belong to the same genus, we raised the question as to whether PERV is affected by APOBEC3 proteins. Initial data indicate that human and porcine cytidine deaminases inhibit PERV replication, thereby possibly reducing the risk for infection of human cells by PERV as a consequence of pig-to-human xenotransplantation.","['Dorrschuck, E', 'Munk, C', 'Tonjes, R R']","['Dorrschuck E', 'Munk C', 'Tonjes RR']","['Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Transplant Proc,Transplantation proceedings,0243532,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)']",IM,"['APOBEC Deaminases', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Deaminase', 'Cytosine Deaminase/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/drug effects/immunology/*pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Swine', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/08/08 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/08 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-1345(08)00236-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.03.032 [doi]']",ppublish,Transplant Proc. 2008 May;40(4):959-61. doi: 10.1016/j.transproceed.2008.03.032.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one children with newly diagnosed acute non-mature B-lymphoblastic leukemia received the ALL-XH-99 protocol treatment. Their medical data, including clinical, biological and molecule features, early responses to treatment (bone marrow evaluation on the 19th day of induction therapy), minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow after remission induction therapy, the risk grade of disease before the beginning of chemotherapy and the outcome, were retrospectively studied. RESULTS: Univariable analysis indicated that the gender and P170 levels before therapy had no effect on the outcome. Age, initial white blood cell count (WBC), prednisone response, early response to treatment, fusion genes (BCR/ABL or MLL/AF4) and MRD level were significantly related to the EFS (P<0.01). Immunophenotype, myeloid-associated antigen and the risk grade of disease were also related to the EFS (P<0.05).

The viral integrase protein is key in this essential step of the retroviral life cycle. Although the basic mechanism of integration by mammalian retroviruses has been well characterized, the factors determining how viral integration events are targeted to particular regions of the genome or to regions of a particular DNA structure remain poorly defined. Significant questions remain regarding the influence of host proteins on the selection of target sites, on the repair of integration intermediates, and on the efficiency of integration. RESULTS: We describe the results of a yeast two-hybrid screen using Moloney murine leukemia virus integrase as bait to screen murine cDNA libraries for host proteins that interact with the integrase. We identified 27 proteins that interacted with different integrase fusion proteins. The identified proteins include chromatin remodeling, DNA repair and transcription factors (13 proteins); translational regulation factors, helicases, splicing factors and other RNA binding proteins (10 proteins); and transporters or miscellaneous factors (4 proteins). We confirmed the interaction of these proteins with integrase by testing them in the context of other yeast strains with GAL4-DNA binding domain-integrase fusions, and by in vitro binding assays between recombinant proteins. Subsequent analyses revealed that a number of the proteins identified as Mo-MLV integrase interactors also interact with HIV-1 integrase both in yeast and in vitro. CONCLUSION: We identify several proteins interacting directly with both MoMLV and HIV-1 integrases that may be common to the integration reaction pathways of both viruses. Many of the proteins identified in the screen are logical interaction partners for integrase, and the validity of a number of the interactions are supported by other studies. In addition, we observe that some of the proteins have documented interactions with other viruses, raising the intriguing possibility that there may be common host proteins used by different viruses. We undertook this screen to identify host factors that might affect integration target site selection, and find that our screens have generated a wealth of putative interacting proteins that merit further investigation.","['Studamire, Barbara', 'Goff, Stephen P']","['Studamire B', 'Goff SP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Hammer Health Sciences Center, Room 1310c, New York 10032, USA. spg1@columbia.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080613,England,Retrovirology,Retrovirology,101216893,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)']",IM,"['Chromatin/chemistry/*virology', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/physiology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Integrases/*metabolism/physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/physiology', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Virus Integration']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/10/17 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2007/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['1742-4690-5-48 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-48 [doi]']",epublish,Retrovirology. 2008 Jun 13;5:48. doi: 10.1186/1742-4690-5-48.,,"['R01 CA030488/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SC2 GM088095/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', '5 R01 CA30488-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC2481268,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most recent kinase inhibitor to come to market, disatinib (Sprycel, Bristol-Myers Squibb), acts on c-SRC, ABL and Bruton's tyrosine kinase. To date, kinase inhibitor drugs are approved for oncology and demonstrate that it is possible to develop compounds with relative selectivity for the target kinase against the broader kinome.

The purpose of the present study was to determine whether this property is shared by flavonoids. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The hydrolysis of anandamide in homogenates and intact cells was measured using the substrate labelled in the ethanolamine part of the molecule. KEY RESULTS: Twenty compounds were tested. Among the commonly occurring flavonoids, kaempferol was the most potent, inhibiting FAAH in a competitive manner with a K(i) value of 5 microM. Among flavonoids with a more restricted distribution in nature, the two most active toward FAAH were 7-hydroxyflavone (IC(50) value of 0.5-1 microM depending on the solvent used) and 3,7-dihydroxyflavone (IC(50) value 2.2 microM). All three compounds reduced the FAAH-dependent uptake of anandamide and its metabolism by intact RBL2H3 basophilic leukaemia cells. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Inhibition of FAAH is an additional in vitro biochemical property of flavonoids. Kaempferol, 7-hydroxyflavone and 3,7-dihydroxyflavone may be useful as templates for the synthesis of novel compounds, which target several systems that are involved in the control of inflammation and cancer.","['Thors, L', 'Belghiti, M', 'Fowler, C J']","['Thors L', 'Belghiti M', 'Fowler CJ']","['Department of Pharmacology and Clinical Neuroscience, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080616,England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Endocannabinoids)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Polyunsaturated Alkamides)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (fatty-acid amide hydrolase)', 'UR5G69TJKH (anandamide)']",IM,"['Amidohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Arachidonic Acids/*metabolism', 'Endocannabinoids', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kaempferols/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyunsaturated Alkamides/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/10/09 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/09 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['bjp2008237 [pii]', '10.1038/bjp.2008.237 [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2008 Sep;155(2):244-52. doi: 10.1038/bjp.2008.237.

We tested the hypothesis that domestic radon exposure increases the risk for childhood cancer. METHODS: We identified 2400 incident cases of leukemia, central nervous system tumor, and malignant lymphoma diagnosed in children between 1968 and 1994 in the Danish Cancer Registry. Control children (n = 6697) were selected from the Danish Central Population Registry. Radon levels in residences of children and the cumulated exposure of each child were calculated as the product of exposure level and time, for each address occupied during childhood. RESULTS: Cumulative radon exposure was associated with risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), with rate ratios of 1.21 (95% confidence interval = 0.98-1.49) for levels of 0.26 to 0.89 x 10(3) Bq/m3-years and 1.63 (1.05-2.53) for exposure to >0.89 x 10(3) Bq/m3-years, when compared with <0.26 x 10(3) Bq/m3-years. A linear dose-response analysis showed a 56% increase in the rate of ALL per 10(3) Bq/m3-years increase in exposure. The association with ALL persisted in sensitivity analyses and after adjustment for potential confounders. No association was found with the other types of childhood cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that domestic radon exposure increases the risk for ALL during childhood but not for other childhood cancers.","['Raaschou-Nielsen, Ole', 'Andersen, Claus E', 'Andersen, Helle P', 'Gravesen, Peter', 'Lind, Morten', 'Schuz, Joachim', 'Ulbak, Kaare']","['Raaschou-Nielsen O', 'Andersen CE', 'Andersen HP', 'Gravesen P', 'Lind M', 'Schuz J', 'Ulbak K']","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. ole@cancer.dk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,['Q74S4N8N1G (Radon)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Housing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Radon/*adverse effects/analysis', 'Registries', 'Risk Assessment']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/EDE.0b013e318176bfcd [doi]', '00001648-200807000-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Epidemiology. 2008 Jul;19(4):536-43. doi: 10.1097/EDE.0b013e318176bfcd.,,,,,,['Epidemiology. 2008 Jul;19(4):544-5.

Among its other functions, TNFalpha perturbs muscle regeneration by preventing satellite cell differentiation. In the present study, the role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a mediator of TNFalpha, was investigated in differentiating myoblast cell lines. Addition of TNFalpha to C2 myoblasts induced immediate and delayed phases of JNK activity. The delayed phase is associated with myoblast proliferation. Inhibition of JNK activity prevented proliferation and restored differentiation to TNFalpha-treated myoblasts. Studies with cell lines expressing MyoD:ER chimera and lacking JNK1 or JNK2 genes indicate that JNK1 activity mediates the effects of TNFalpha on myoblast proliferation and differentiation. TNFalpha does not induce proliferation or inhibit differentiation of JNK1-null myoblasts. However, differentiation of JNK1-null myoblasts is inhibited when they are grown in conditioned medium derived from cell lines affected by TNFalpha. We investigated the induced synthesis of several candidate growth factors and cytokines following treatment with TNFalpha. Expression of IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was induced by TNFalpha in wild-type and JNK2-null myoblasts. However, LIF expression was not induced by TNFalpha in JNK1-null myoblasts. Addition of LIF to the growth medium of JNK1-null myoblasts prevented their differentiation. Moreover, LIF-neutralizing antibodies added to the medium of C2 myoblasts prevented inhibition of differentiation mediated by TNFalpha. Hence, TNFalpha promotes myoblast proliferation through JNK1 and prevents myoblast differentiation through JNK1-mediated secretion of LIF.","['Alter, Joel', 'Rozentzweig, Dafna', 'Bengal, Eyal']","['Alter J', 'Rozentzweig D', 'Bengal E']","['Department of Biochemistry, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa 31096, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080615,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Myoblasts/*cytology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(19)49379-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M801379200 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2008 Aug 22;283(34):23224-34. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M801379200.

In B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), we prospectively assessed the impact of CD40 and CD27 on outcome in 121 children treated according to the CoALL06-97 protocol. Expression of both CD40 and CD27 was found to be significantly higher in low- than in high-risk patients as defined by standard clinical risk parameters such as age and white blood cell count. In addition, in multivariable analysis, a very high percentage of CD40(+) blasts at diagnosis was identified as an independent favorable prognostic factor for relapse-free survival. Of note, high CD40 expression particularly protected against late relapse. In B cells, CD40 is known to enhance both antigen-presenting capacity and sensitivity to proapoptotic signals. Yet, although CD40 ligation does result in significant up-regulation of CD80/CD86 in our cohort, it is up-regulation of the death receptor CD95 that significantly correlates with the percentage of CD40(+) blasts.

Susceptibility to t-AML has a genetic component, yet specific genetic variants that influence susceptibility are poorly understood. We analyzed an F(2) intercross (n = 282 mice) between mouse strains resistant or susceptible to t-AML induced by the alkylator ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) to identify genes that regulate t-AML susceptibility. Each mouse carried the hCG-PML/RARA transgene, a well-characterized initiator of myeloid leukemia. In the absence of ENU treatment, transgenic F(2) mice developed leukemia with higher incidence (79.4% vs 12.5%) and at earlier time points (108 days vs 234 days) than mice in the resistant background. ENU treatment of F(2) mice further increased incidence (90.4%) and shortened median survival (171 vs 254 days). We genotyped F(2) mice at 384 informative single nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome and performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Thirteen QTLs significantly associated with leukemia-free survival, spleen weight, or white blood cell count were identified on 8 chromosomes. These results suggest that susceptibility to ENU-induced leukemia in mice is a complex trait governed by genes at multiple loci. Improved understanding of genetic risk factors should lead to tailored treatment regimens that reduce risk for patients predisposed to t-AML.","['Funk, Ryan K', 'Maxwell, Taylor J', 'Izumi, Masayo', 'Edwin, Deepa', 'Kreisel, Friederike', 'Ley, Timothy J', 'Cheverud, James M', 'Graubert, Timothy A']","['Funk RK', 'Maxwell TJ', 'Izumi M', 'Edwin D', 'Kreisel F', 'Ley TJ', 'Cheverud JM', 'Graubert TA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stem Cell Biology Section, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20080613,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*genetics', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*chemically induced/*genetics', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', '*Oncogene Proteins, Fusion', 'Organ Size/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Spleen']",2008/06/17 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49734-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-132084 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1434-42. doi: 10.1182/blood-2008-01-132084.

CD66d is a neutrophil lineage-specific marker, and CD66a and CD66c are found on epithelial and other cells. HL-60 cells continuously treated with ATRA underwent apoptosis, and cells transiently treated for 1 day underwent cell-cycle arrest, entered into senescence, and exhibited reduced apoptosis with CD66-positive cells accounting for the majority of live cells. CD66 antigens were also induced in NB4 leukemic cells upon continuous treatment with ATRA. NB4 cells underwent apoptosis with a higher frequency in transient versus continuous-treated cells (38% vs. 19% at Day 5), in contrast to HL-60 cells that underwent cell-cycle arrest and senescence when transiently treated with ATRA. CD66 antigens were not induced in transient, ATRA-treated NB4 cells compared with HL-60 cells. Cell-cycle arrest in HL-60 cells involved reduction in expression levels of p21, cyclins D and E, while Rb1 exhibited reduction in protein levels without changes in mRNA levels over the time course of ATRA treatment. Analysis of several proapoptotic proteins implicated the activation of calpain and cleavage of Bax in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, similar to published studies about the apoptosis of neutrophils. CD1d expression was also induced by ATRA in HL-60 cells and ligation with anti-CD1d antibody-induced apoptosis. In contrast, CD1d-positive primary monocytes were protected from spontaneous apoptosis by CD1d ligation. These studies demonstrate distinct cell fates for ATRA-treated HL-60 cells that provide new insights into ATRA-induced cell differentiation.","['Ozeki, Munetaka', 'Shively, John E']","['Ozeki M', 'Shively JE']","['Division of Immunology, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, 1500E.

The molecular mechanisms of this regulation, however, have been largely unknown. In this work, we show that the expression of the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) protein, an anti-apoptotic member of B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family, increases in thyroid hormone receptor-expressing human kidney-2 (HK2) cells upon 6-h incubation in 100 nM T(3); we also describe the molecular mechanisms leading to this phenomenon. Transcription regulation assays performed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells show that 100 nM T(3) increases transcription from the MCL-1 promoter twofold in the presence of thyroid hormone receptor beta1, but not of its alpha1 isoform. However, this increase is not a result of direct activation via the thyroid hormone-response element, TRE-DR4, located at the -998 to -983 position in this promoter; furthermore, the presence of 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor is not required. The promoter's activation is abolished in the presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) inhibitor, wortmannin. The -295 to -107 promoter fragment contains all sequences involved in T(3)-dependent activation of the MCL-1 promoter, and cAMP-responsive element located at the -262 to -255 position is a major mediator in this process. Therefore, MCL-1 expression is activated by T(3), which increases its promoter activity by a non-genomic mechanism using the PI3-K signal transduction pathway. We propose that this is another mechanism by which T(3) regulates apoptosis.","['Pietrzak, Maciej', 'Puzianowska-Kuznicka, Monika']","['Pietrzak M', 'Puzianowska-Kuznicka M']","['Department of Endocrinology, Medical Research Center, Polish Academy of Sciences, Pawinskiego 5, 02-106 Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080613,England,J Mol Endocrinol,Journal of molecular endocrinology,8902617,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Receptors, Thyroid Hormone)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '06LU7C9H1V (Triiodothyronine)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Receptors, Thyroid Hormone/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Retinoid X Receptors/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triiodothyronine/*pharmacology']",2008/06/17 09:00,2009/01/31 09:00,['2008/06/17 09:00'],"['2008/06/17 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/01/31 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/17 09:00 [entrez]']","['JME-08-0010 [pii]', '10.1677/JME-08-0010 [doi]']",ppublish,J Mol Endocrinol. 2008 Sep;41(3):177-86. doi: 10.1677/JME-08-0010.

In all, 10 trials were included in the analysis, which showed no significant difference in clinical failure rates and mortality for ambulatory regimens and standard hospital-based therapy. Subgroup analysis according to the type of fever episode showed no significant differences in clinical failure rates for fever of unknown origin and fever due to documented infections. Subgroup analyses in two independent trials identified an absolute neutrophil count < 100 cells/ mm3 as being predictive of outpatient treatment failure (P < 0.04). These findings need to be confirmed by further trials. Thus, outpatient management of adult cancer patients with low-risk febrile neutropenia is safe, effective, and comparable to standard hospital-based therapy.

These results define what we believe to be a novel immune dysfunction in T cells from patients with CLL that has implications for both autologous and allogeneic immunotherapy approaches and identifies repair of immune synapse defects as an essential step in improving cancer immunotherapy approaches.","['Ramsay, Alan G', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lee, Abigail M', 'Gorgun, Gullu', 'Le Dieu, Rifca', 'Blum, William', 'Byrd, John C', 'Gribben, John G']","['Ramsay AG', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lee AM', 'Gorgun G', 'Le Dieu R', 'Blum W', 'Byrd JC', 'Gribben JG']","['Institute of Cancer, Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and The London School of Medicine, University of London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Superantigens)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigen Presentation/drug effects/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Superantigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/09/26 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2008/05/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/26 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI35017 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2008 Jul;118(7):2427-37. doi: 10.1172/JCI35017.,,"['P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2423865,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fludarabine (FLU), a known anticancer drug, has been shown to downregulate Treg cells in vivo in chronic leukemia patients. Melanoma tumor antigen Mart-1(27-35)-specific CD8+ CTLs generated in vitrowith total peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) lose their activity within 14-21 days with concomitant expansion of Treg cells. When CD4+ cells are removed from PBL and CTL are generated with purified CD8+ cells, the CTL survive and maintain their activity for a significantly longer period. METHODS: We used a low dose of FLU in the cultures in Mart-1-specific CTL generation assays with total PBL. Blood samples were taken from HLA-A2-positive melanoma patients and normal donors. Autologous matured dendritic cells pulsed with Mart-1(27-35) peptide were used to generate CTL responses using purified CD8+ cells or total PBL. RESULTS: The presence of FLU in the cultures with PBL helped to generate a significantly higher number of antigen-specific CTLs as detected by Mart-1 HLA-A2 tetramer staining. Specificity of such CTLs was determined by IFN-gamma secretion or by cytotoxicity against the target cells bearing the specific antigen. The presence of FLU stopped the expansion of IL-10-producing CD4+ Treg cells in the cultures with PBL. Analyses of expanded CD4+ cells isolated from PBL in vitro cocultures with FLU showed a Th1 type of function. Those cells secreted higher amounts of IFN-gamma and very low levels of IL-10, or no IL-10 at all, upon restimulation. CONCLUSION: The observations of the study are as important for adaptive immunotherapy of cancer as they are for vaccine-based approaches.","['Hegde, Upendra', 'Chhabra, Arvind', 'Chattopadhyay, Subhasis', 'Das, Raja', 'Ray, Swagatam', 'Chakraborty, Nitya G']","['Hegde U', 'Chhabra A', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Das R', 'Ray S', 'Chakraborty NG']","['Department of Medicine, Carole and Ray Neag Comprehensive Cancer Center, Farmington, Conn., USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*immunology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/08/20 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2007/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2008/01/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/20 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['000124981 [pii]', '10.1159/000124981 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2008;75(3):200-8. doi: 10.1159/000124981.,,['MO1RR06192/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright 2008 S.

To assess the underlying mechanisms, C/EBPalpha targets were identified by microarray analyses. Upon C/EBPalpha activation, expression of c-Myb and GATA-2 was repressed in 32D-BCR/ABL, K562, and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) blast crisis (BC) primary cells but only c-Myb levels decreased slightly in CD34(+) normal progenitors. The role of these 2 genes for the effects of C/EBPalpha was assessed by perturbing their expression in K562 cells. Ectopic c-Myb expression blocked the proliferation inhibition- and differentiation-inducing effects of C/EBPalpha, whereas c-Myb siRNA treatment enhanced C/EBPalpha-mediated proliferation inhibition and induced changes in gene expression indicative of monocytic differentiation. Ectopic GATA-2 expression suppressed the proliferation inhibitory effect of C/EBPalpha but blocked in part the effect on differentiation; GATA-2 siRNA treatment had no effects on C/EBPalpha induction of differentiation but inhibited proliferation of K562 cells, alone or upon C/EBPalpha activation. In summary, the effects of C/EBPalpha in p210(BCR/ABL)-expressing cells depend, in part, on transcriptional repression of c-Myb and GATA-2. Since perturbation of c-Myb and GATA-2 expression has nonidentical consequences for proliferation and differentiation of K562 cells, the effects of C/EBPalpha appear to involve dif-ferent transcription-regulated targets.","['Soliera, Angela Rachele', 'Lidonnici, Maria Rosa', 'Ferrari-Amorotti, Giovanna', 'Prisco, Marco', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Martinez, Robert V', 'Donato, Nick J', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Soliera AR', 'Lidonnici MR', 'Ferrari-Amorotti G', 'Prisco M', 'Zhang Y', 'Martinez RV', 'Donato NJ', 'Calabretta B']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20080612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Genes, abl', 'Genes, myb/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/10/01 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/01 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49629-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-114975 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Sep 1;112(5):1942-50. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-09-114975.

Dasa-tinib showed a dose- and time-dependent reduction of global tyrosine phosphorylation and of activating phosphotyrosine levels of SFKs. Treatment with 100 nM dasatinib led to decreased levels of the activated, phosphorylated forms of Akt, Erk1/2, and p38, and induced PARP cleavage through caspase activity. In Mec1 and JVM-3 cell lines, dasatinib increased p53 protein levels and inhibited proliferation. In freshly isolated CLL cells, dasatinib reduced the expression of Mcl-1 and Bcl-x(L). Combination of 5 microM dasatinib and fludarabine increased the apoptosis induction of each by approximately 50%. In 15 primary CLL samples, cells with unmutated immunoglobulin variable heavy chain (IgV(H)) genes were more sensitive to dasatinib than those with mutated IgV(H) genes (P = .002). In summary, dasatinib shows potent inhibitory effects on the survival of CLL cells in vitro, most prominently in samples obtained from patients with unfavorable prognostic features.","['Veldurthy, Aditya', 'Patz, Michaela', 'Hagist, Susanne', 'Pallasch, Christian P', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin', 'Hallek, Michael', 'Krause, Gunter']","['Veldurthy A', 'Patz M', 'Hagist S', 'Pallasch CP', 'Wendtner CM', 'Hallek M', 'Krause G']","['Department I for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Caspases/metabolism', 'Dasatinib', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/drug effects']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49735-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-11-123984 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1443-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-11-123984.

SCL/TAL-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor absolutely critical for hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell specification and lineage maturation. Using in vitro and forced expression experimental systems, we previously suggested that SCL might have DNA-binding-independent functions. Here, to assess the requirements for SCL DNA-binding activity in vivo, we examined hematopoietic development in mice carrying a germline DNA-binding mutation. Remarkably, in contrast to complete absence of hematopoiesis and early lethality in scl-null embryos, specification of hematopoietic cells occurred in homozygous mutant embryos, indicating that direct DNA binding is dispensable for this process. Lethality was forestalled to later in development, although some mice survived to adulthood. Anemia was documented throughout development and in adulthood. Cellular and molecular studies showed requirements for SCL direct DNA binding in red cell maturation and indicated that scl expression is positively autoregulated in terminally differentiating erythroid cells. Thus, different mechanisms of SCL's action predominate depending on the developmental/cellular context: indirect DNA binding activities and/or sequestration of other nuclear regulators are sufficient in specification processes, whereas direct DNA binding functions with transcriptional autoregulation are critically required in terminal maturation processes.","['Kassouf, Mira T', 'Chagraoui, Hedia', 'Vyas, Paresh', 'Porcher, Catherine']","['Kassouf MT', 'Chagraoui H', 'Vyas P', 'Porcher C']","['Department of Haematology, Medical Research Council, Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080612,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Anemia/genetics', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/metabolism/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/09/17 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/17 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)49691-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-12-128900 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2008 Aug 15;112(4):1056-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2007-12-128900.

This was further supported by low levels of plasma soluble CD163 and a concordant low number of CD163-expressing monocytes. We show that CD163 positive monocytes and macrophages from liver, spleen, and bone marrow coexpress CD33, thus suggesting that the GO-induced cellular cytotoxicity of CD33 positive cells eradicates a significant part of the CD163 positive monocytes and macrophages. The risk of severe toxic symptoms from plasma hemoglobin should be considered after CD33-targeted chemotherapy when the disease is complicated by a pathologic intravascular hemolysis.

Because germline deletion of Mcl-1 results in peri-implantation lethality, we address the function of Mcl-1 in the nervous system using two different conditional Mcl-1 mouse mutants in the developing nervous system. Here, we show for the first time that Mcl-1 is required for neuronal development. Neural precursors within the ventricular zone and newly committed neurons in the cortical plate express high levels of Mcl-1 throughout cortical neurogenesis. Loss of Mcl-1 in neuronal progenitors results in widespread apoptosis. Double labeling with active caspase 3 and Tuj1 reveals that newly committed Mcl1 deficient neurons undergo apoptosis as they commence migration away from the ventricular zone. Examination of neural progenitor differentiation in vitro demonstrated that cell death in the absence of Mcl1 is cell autonomous. Although conditional deletion of Mcl-1 in cultured neurons does not trigger apoptosis, loss of Mcl-1 sensitizes neurons to an acute DNA damaging insult. Indeed, the rapid reduction of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels are early events after DNA damage in neurons, and maintaining high Mcl-1 levels can protect neurons against death. Together, our results are the first to demonstrate the requirement of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, for cortical neurogenesis and the survival of neurons after DNA damage.","['Arbour, Nicole', 'Vanderluit, Jacqueline L', 'Le Grand, J Nicole', 'Jahani-Asl, Arezu', 'Ruzhynsky, Vladimir A', 'Cheung, Eric C C', 'Kelly, Melissa A', 'MacKenzie, Alexander E', 'Park, David S', 'Opferman, Joseph T', 'Slack, Ruth S']","['Arbour N', 'Vanderluit JL', 'Le Grand JN', 'Jahani-Asl A', 'Ruzhynsky VA', 'Cheung EC', 'Kelly MA', 'MacKenzie AE', 'Park DS', 'Opferman JT', 'Slack RS']","['Department of Biochemistry, Microbiology, and Immunology, Ottawa Health Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada K1H 8M5.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (beta3 tubulin, mouse)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics/*physiology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System/cytology/*embryology', 'DNA Damage/genetics/*physiology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/genetics/*physiology', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*physiology', 'Stem Cells/physiology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tubulin/metabolism']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/07/11 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/11 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['28/24/6068 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4940-07.2008 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2008 Jun 11;28(24):6068-78. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4940-07.2008.,,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2681190,['NIHMS92854'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that the HTLV-1-encoded Tax protein inhibits the function of tumor suppressor p53 through a Tax-induced NF-kappaB pathway. Given these attributes, we were interested in the activity of small-molecule inhibitor 9-aminoacridine (9AA), an anticancer drug that targets two important stress response pathways, NF-kappaB and p53. In the present study, we have examined the effects of 9AA on HTLV-1-transformed cells. Treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cells with 9AA resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell viability. Consistent with these results, we observed an increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G(1) and an increase in the number of cells positive by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay following treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cells with 9AA. In each assay, HTLV-1-transformed cells C8166, Hut102, and MT2 were more sensitive to treatment with 9AA than control CEM and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Analyzing p53 function, we demonstrate that treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cells with 9AA resulted in an increase in p53 protein and activation of p53 transcription activity. Of significance, 9AA-induced cell death could be blocked by introduction of a p53 small interfering RNA, linking p53 activity and cell death. These results suggest that Tax-repressed p53 function in HTLV-1-transformed cells is ""druggable"" and can be restored by treatment with 9AA. The fact that 9AA induces p53 and inhibits NF-kappaB suggests a promising strategy for the treatment of HTLV-1-transformed cells.","['Jung, Kyung-Jin', 'Dasgupta, Arindam', 'Huang, Keven', 'Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia', 'Gurova, Katerina V', 'Brady, John N']","['Jung KJ', 'Dasgupta A', 'Huang K', 'Jeong SJ', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Gurova KV', 'Brady JN']","['Virus Tumor Biology Section, Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080611,United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '78OY3Z0P7Z (Aminacrine)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Aminacrine/*pharmacology', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling/methods', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*biosynthesis']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/09/30 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/30 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00690-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00690-08 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol. 2008 Sep;82(17):8537-47. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00690-08.

Because the outcomes of splenectomy in patients with T-LGL have been only reported sporadically, we objectively assessed the outcomes of splenectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: When a cohort of 56 T-LGL patients was analyzed, patients with splenomegaly (n = 34) and had higher frequency of bi- and pancytopenia than patients with no splenomegaly (70% vs 27%; p = 0.001). We identified 15 patients who, in their clinical course, underwent splenectomy and studied their hematological and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Indications for splenectomy included symptomatic splenomegaly and/or severe refractory cytopenia. Median spleen weight was 1300 g, consistent with diagnosis of splenomegaly; T-cell receptor (TCR)-gamma rearrangement and typical T-LGL were detected by immunophenotype in all specimens. There was no surgery-related mortality, with the median follow-up and survival of 719 and 498 days, respectively. Two patients died due to causes possibly related to the splenectomized state and/or primary disease. All patients showed lineage-specific hematologic response and achieved transfusion independence; however, precise molecular analysis of TCR and variable chain Vbeta flow cytometry showed persistence of the LGL clones. CONCLUSION: We conclude that splenectomy constitutes a viable and safe therapeutic option for patients with T-LGL, splenomegaly, and refractory cytopenia.","['Subbiah, Vivek', 'Viny, Aaron D', 'Rosenblatt, Steven', 'Pohlman, Brad', 'Lichtin, Alan', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Subbiah V', 'Viny AD', 'Rosenblatt S', 'Pohlman B', 'Lichtin A', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080611,Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/blood/complications/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Pancytopenia/*etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenectomy/*statistics & numerical data', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/*surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2008/06/14 09:00,2008/10/24 09:00,['2008/06/14 09:00'],"['2008/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/24 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/14 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(08)00176-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.005 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2008 Sep;36(9):1078-83. doi: 10.1016/j.exphem.2008.04.005.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) maintained in N2B27 supplemented with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-4 were induced to differentiate into Brachyury/T-expressing cells (measured using a green fluorescent protein reporter) and myeloid-erythroid colony-forming cells (ME-CFCs), by removing LIF, changing the base media formulation, and via the time- and concentration-dependent addition of other factors. RESULTS: Presence of 10 ng/mL BMP-4 permitted the emergence of cells expressing T and the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, however, <5% of the cells were double-positive on day 4. Adjusting the SF media formulation allowed only 5 ng/mL BMP-4 to yield 24% +/- 4% Brachyury-green fluorescent protein VEGFR-2(+) cells by day 4. These cells could develop into ME-CFC, producing 4.4 +/- 0.8 CFC per 1000 cells at day 8. We also examined the timing and concentration sensitivity of BMP-4, VEGF, and thrombopoietin (TPO) during differentiation. BMP-4 with 50 ng/mL TPO generated 232 +/- 48 CFC per 5 x 10(4) cells, similar to the serum-control, and this response could be enhanced to 292 +/- 42 CFC per 5 x 10(4) cells by early (between day 0-5), but not late (after day 5) VEGF treatment. CONCLUSION: Moving to SF systems facilitates directed differentiation by eliminating confounding signals.

Diosgenin is a very interesting natural product because, depending on the specific dose used, its biological effect is very different in HEL (human erythroleukemia) cells. For example, at 10 microM, diosgenin induced megakaryocytic differentiation, in contrast to 40 microM diosgenin, which induced apoptosis in HEL cells previously demonstrated using sedimentation field-flow fractionation (SdFFF). The goal of this work focused on the correlation between cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and thromboxane synthase (TxS) and megakaryocytic differentiation induced by diosgenin in HEL cells. Furthermore, the technique of SdFFF, having been validated in our models, was used in this new study as an analytical tool that provided us with more or less enriched differentiated cell fractions that could then be used for further analyses of enzyme protein expression and activity for the first time. In our study, we showed the implication of COX-2 and TxS in diosgenin-induced megakaryocytic differentiation in HEL cells.

HL-60 cells were divided into 5 groups: control group, Ara-C group, rsTRAIL group, Ara-C + rsTRAIL simultaneously given group, Ara-C + rsTRAIL tandem given group (Ara-C followed by rsTRAIL group). The cytotoxic effect was measured by MTT assay; cell apoptosis rate was determined by flow cytometry after Annexin V/PI staining; the expression level of DR5 on surface of HL-60 cells treated with Ara-C at different concentrations for 24 hours was determined by flow cytometry. The expression level of DR5 on surface of HL-60 cells and caspase-8 activity in HL-60 cells of rsTRAIL group and Ara-C + rsTRAIL tandem group was determined by flow cytometry. The result showed that rsTRAIL could inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells and induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The apoptosis rate of HL-60 cells in Ara-C + rsTRAIL tandem given group was higher than that in Ara-C + rsTRAIL simultaneously given group, the expression level of DR5 on surface of HL-60 cells and intracellular activity of caspase-8 in Ara-C + rsTRAIL tandem given group were higher than those in rsTRAIL group. When HL-60 cells treated with 5 and 10 mg/L of Ara-C for 24 hours, the expression level of DR5 on surface of HL-60 cells was higher than that in control group.

Ara-C can upregulate DR5 expression on the surface of HL-60 cells and enhance the effect of rsTRAIL-inducing apoptosis. Tandem treatment of HL-60 cells with Ara-C followed by rsTRAIL induce more apoptosis than that of co-treatment with rsTRAIL and Ara-C.

The effects of triptolide on apoptosis of Jurkat cells were determined by DNA fragmentation (DNA ladder), Hoechst 33258, PI and Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining. The results demonstrated that triptolide inhibited the proliferation of Jurket cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) was 4.0 microg/L. Chromatin condensation in the cells treated with triptolide could be seen by light microscopy. DNA electrophoresis showed evidence of nuclear fragmentation (DNA ladder). The hypoploid (sub-G(1)) population was increased after treatment with triptolide. The translocation of phosphatidylserine at the outer surface of the cell plasma membrane could be induced by triptolide.

Furthermore, SYBR Green real-time PCR and immunoblotting method were used to evaluate the specificity of gene expression. The results showed that the full length cDNA of MLAA-22 located on chromosome 17q11.2 was 2.0 kb in size, and a putative protein was approximately 72.4 kD for 631 amino acids. The MLAA-22 encoded a cancer/testis antigen in human, which is nonsecreting type, plasmosin, labile protein, hydrophilia, thermostability, and without signal peptide. Many motifs might related to growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Antigenic peptides was synthesized as the antigen with Fmoc/PyBOP method.

Bcl-xl was checked by immunoblotting after activation of phosphionositide-3 kinase (PI3K) in AML cells treated with SDF-1. The results indicated that the expressions of the surface molecules on AML (KG1a, ML1 and U937) cells were different.

SDF-1 promoted ML1 and U937 cell adhesion to the stroma cells (HS5, HS27), stimulated PI3K in the cells. It was also confirmed that SDF-1 could increase the leukemic cell survival by stimulate this pathway. After addition of wortmaninn or PTX, the cell death increased.

It is, however, not known whether FCM analysis can reliably be standardized for multicentric application. METHODS: An extensive standardization program was installed in four collaborating laboratories, which study FCM-MRD in children treated with the AIEOP-BFM-ALL 2000 protocol. This included methodological alignment, continuous quality monitoring, as well as personnel education by exchange and performance feed-back. RESULTS: Blinded inter-laboratory tests of list-mode data interpretation concordance (n = 202 blood and bone marrow samples from follow-up during induction of 31 randomly selected patients of a total series of n = 395) showed a very high degree of inter-rater agreement among the four centers despite differences in cytometers and software usage (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 0.979 based on n= 800 single values). Lower concordance was reached with amounts of MRD below 0.1%. Comparing data from sample exchange experiments (n = 42 samples; ICC 0.98) and from independent patient cohorts from the four centers (regarding positive samples per time-point of follow-up as well as risk estimates) concordance was also good.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), a member of the Tec family of tyrosine kinases with a crucial role in B-cell development, is consistently tyrosine phosphorylated in Bcr-Abl expressing murine pre B cells. BTK has been implicated in Bcr-Abl-mediated B-cell transformation and resistance to imatinib, implying that inhibiting BTK may be therapeutically beneficial. We decided to test whether BTK is a critical node in Bcr-Abl transformation and potential drug target in imatinib-resistant Bcr-Abl-positive cells. We depleted BTK in Ba/F3 and 32D cells expressing native and kinase domain (KD) mutant (E255K and T315I) Bcr-Abl, using shRNA. BTK levels were reduced to <10% of controls. However, no differences in viability and cell proliferation were observed and the response to imatinib was not altered. Consistent with this, proliferation and viability were unaffected by inhibition of BTK with reversible (PC-005) and irreversible (PCI-31523) small molecule inhibitors. Lastly, BTK inhibition did not affect the ability of Bcr-Abl to transform primary murine hematopoietic cells in colony forming and B-cell transformation assays.

Epigenetic changes in DNA and chromatin, which must occur to allow the accessibility of transcriptional factors at specific DNA-binding sites, are regarded as emerging major players for embryonic and hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) development and lineage differentiation. Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression, whether it be in conjunction with chromosomal alterations and gene mutations or not, is a newly recognized mechanism that leads to several diseases, including leukemia. The reversibility of epigenetic modifications makes DNA and chromatin changes attractive targets for therapeutic intervention.

PI-103 is a new potent PI3K/Akt and mTOR inhibitor. In human leukemic cell lines and in primary blast cells from AML patients, PI-103 inhibited constitutive and growth factor-induced PI3K/Akt and mTORC1 activation. PI-103 was essentially cytostatic for cell lines and induced cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase. In blast cells, PI-103 inhibited leukemic proliferation, the clonogenicity of leukemic progenitors and induced mitochondrial apoptosis, especially in the compartment containing leukemic stem cells. In contrast, apoptosis was not induced with RAD001 and IC87114 association, which specifically inhibits mTORC1 and p110delta activity, respectively. PI-103 had additive proapoptotic effects with etoposide in blast cells and in immature leukemic cells. Interestingly, PI-103 did not induce apoptosis in normal CD34(+) cells and had moderate effects on their clonogenic and proliferative properties.

Azacitidine has been shown to have survival benefits in patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and has activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). It is administered by subcutaneous (s.c.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection daily at a dose of 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days every 4 weeks. An oral formulation would facilitate dosing, reduce administration side effects and potentially maximize azacitidine pharmacologic action. Previously, oral formulations of this class of agent have failed due to rapid catabolism by cytidine deaminase and hydrolysis in aqueous environments. Development of a film-coated formulation has circumvented this difficulty. In a formulation feasibility pilot study, four subjects with solid malignant tumors, AML or MDS received single oral doses of 60 or 80 mg azacitidine. Subjects demonstrated measurable plasma concentrations of azacitidine, allowing bioavailability comparisons to be made to historical pharmacokinetic data for s.c. azacitidine. Subjects safely tolerated 80 mg, a dose for which the mean bioavailability was 17.4% of historic s.c. exposure. No severe drug-related toxicities were observed.

Here we show that spongistatin 1 potently induces cell death in patient primary acute leukemic cells with higher efficiency than 8/10 clinically used cytotoxic drugs and prevents long-term survival of leukemic cell lines. Spongistatin 1 triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in Jurkat T cells by the release of cytochrome c, Smac/DIABLO and Omi/HtrA2. As caspase-9 acts as an initiator caspase and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL overexpression suppress spongistatin 1-induced apoptosis, cell death is mediated through the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Importantly, spongistatin 1 leads to the degradation of the antiapoptotic X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. In apoptosis-resistant leukemic tumor cells overexpressing XIAP, spongistatin 1 effectively causes cell death and potentiates cell death induction by other apoptosis-promoting factors that might be caused by spongistatin 1-mediated degradation of XIAP. Our data show that spongistatin 1 represents a promising novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of leukemic tumor cells especially in the clinically highly relevant situation of chemoresistance due to overexpression of XIAP.","['Schyschka, L', 'Rudy, A', 'Jeremias, I', 'Barth, N', 'Pettit, G R', 'Vollmar, A M']","['Schyschka L', 'Rudy A', 'Jeremias I', 'Barth N', 'Pettit GR', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center for Drug Research, University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080612,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '148179-94-6 (spongistatin 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Macrolides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mitochondrial Proteins', 'Porifera', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/*drug effects/metabolism']",2008/06/13 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008146 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.146 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1737-45. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.146.

We present here the largest series of ALL patients (n=32) in whom Guthrie cards were analyzed for the presence of preleukemic cells. Rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes were used as a marker for leukemic clones. We combined our set of patients with 17 previously published cases. Preleukemic cells were detected in 31 of all 49 patients (63%). Positive screening cards were not associated with patient's age at diagnosis but were almost always found in patients with hyperdiploidy (10/11; 91%; P=0.04). High birth weight is an established risk factor for childhood ALL. Positive screening cards were strongly associated with low birth weight (P=0.01). In conclusion, the majority of childhood B-precursor ALL arise prior to birth. In the search for causes of childhood leukemia we should concentrate on prenatal factors as well as postnatal factors. Our results suggest that autologous cord bloods could be a poor choice as the source of stem cells for transplantation in leukemia, which may contain preleukemic cells.

In a multicenter study, 67 patients with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) were treated with a continuous oral dose of 200-300 mg of lonafarnib and were evaluated for hematologic, pathologic and pharmacodynamic response. The median age of patients was 70 years (range 44-86). There were 32 patients with MDS (RAEB-20 and RAEB-t-12) and 35 with CMML. Overall 16 (24%) of the patients responded with two patients achieving a complete remission and one a partial response. Responses were seen in 6/32 and 10/35 patients with MDS and CMML, respectively. Of the 19 patients who were platelet transfusion-dependent prior to treatment, 5 (26%) became transfusion-free for a median duration of 185 days. A decrease in the farnesylation of the HDJ-2 protein measured in patient-derived cells was observed in the majority of patients during treatment with lonafarnib, but no clear correlation between changes in farnesylation and clinical effect could be made. Gastrointestinal toxicity was significant with 19% of patients discontinuing therapy due to diarrhea, nausea and/or anorexia.

We investigated the interaction of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and p53 pathways after their simultaneous blockade using the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor PI-103 and the Mdm2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. We found that PI-103, which itself has modest apoptogenic activity, acts synergistically with Nutlin-3 to induce apoptosis in a wild-type p53-dependent fashion. PI-103 synergized with Nutlin-3 to induce Bax conformational change and caspase-3 activation, despite its inhibitory effect on p53 induction. The PI-103/Nutlin-3 combination caused profound dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and decreased expression of many proteins including Mdm2, p21, Noxa, Bcl-2 and survivin, which can affect mitochondrial stability. We suggest that PI-103 actively enhances downstream p53 signaling and that a combination strategy aimed at inhibiting PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and activating p53 signaling is potentially effective in AML, where TP53 mutations are rare and downstream p53 signaling is intact.","['Kojima, K', 'Shimanuki, M', 'Shikami, M', 'Samudio, I J', 'Ruvolo, V', 'Corn, P', 'Hanaoka, N', 'Konopleva, M', 'Andreeff, M', 'Nakakuma, H']","['Kojima K', 'Shimanuki M', 'Shikami M', 'Samudio IJ', 'Ruvolo V', 'Corn P', 'Hanaoka N', 'Konopleva M', 'Andreeff M', 'Nakakuma H']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Wakayama Medical University, Wakayama, Japan. k-koji@wakayama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080612,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Furans)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (PI103)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '53IA0V845C (nutlin 3)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Furans/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/drug effects', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinases/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*drug effects/genetics']",2008/06/13 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008158 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.158 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1728-36. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.158.

To assess the potential of LAA-peptide vaccines in eliminating leukemia in CML patients, we measured WT1, PR3, ELA2 and PRAME expression in CD34+ progenitor subpopulations in CML patients and compared them with minor histocompatibility antigens (mHAgs) HA1 and SMCY. All CD34+ subpopulations expressed similar levels of mHAgs irrespective of disease phase, suggesting that in the SCT setting, mHAgs are the best target for GVL. Furthermore, WT1 was consistently overexpressed in advanced phase (AdP) CML in all CD34+ subpopulations, and mature progenitors of chronic phase (CP) CML compared to healthy individuals. PRAME overexpression was limited to more mature AdP-CML progenitors only. Conversely, only CP-CML progenitors had PR3 overexpression, suggesting that PR1-peptide vaccines are only appropriate in CP-CML. Surface expression of WT1 protein in the most primitive hematopoietic stem cells in AdP-CML suggest that they could be targets for WT1 peptide-based vaccines, which in combination with PRAME, could additionally improve targeting differentiated progeny, and benefit patients responding suboptimally to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or enhance GVL effects in SCT patients.","['Yong, A S M', 'Keyvanfar, K', 'Eniafe, R', 'Savani, B N', 'Rezvani, K', 'Sloand, E M', 'Goldman, J M', 'Barrett, A J']","['Yong AS', 'Keyvanfar K', 'Eniafe R', 'Savani BN', 'Rezvani K', 'Sloand EM', 'Goldman JM', 'Barrett AJ']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, M20892-1202, USA. yonga@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20080612,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cancer Vaccines/chemistry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology/pathology', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology']",2008/06/13 09:00,2008/10/23 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['leu2008161 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.161 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2008 Sep;22(9):1721-7. doi: 10.1038/leu.2008.161.

In the 1990s, many argued that there were two different forms of CMML, a proliferative type and a myelodysplastic type. Then in 2001 the World Health Organization created a new category called the mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases, under which CMML was included. Although we still do not understand much about CMML pathogenesis nor do we have specific therapies for this disease, at least now most agree that it is in an appropriate category such that other areas of investigation can now proceed. On the other hand, we now understand a great deal of the pathogenesis underlying the disease now called juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). JMML also fits in the new category of mixed myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases. JMML is an excellent model malignancy for investigating and understanding dysregulated and aberrant signal transduction in the Ras pathway. It has also served as a teaching tool for exploring inherited predispositions to cancer.","['Emanuel, P D']",['Emanuel PD'],"['Department of Medicine, Rockefeller Cancer Institute, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR 72205, USA.

Increased osteoclast activity causes osteoporosis, a disorder resulting in a low bone mass and a high risk of fractures. Increased osteoclast size and numbers are also a hallmark of other disorders, such as Paget's disease and multiple myeloma. The protein c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor complex, is essential for osteoclast differentiation. Here we show that the Fos-related protein Fra-2 controls osteoclast survival and size. The bones of Fra-2-deficient newborn mice have giant osteoclasts, and signalling through leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and its receptor is impaired. Similarly, newborn animals lacking LIF have giant osteoclasts, and we show that LIF is a direct transcriptional target of Fra-2 and c-Jun. Moreover, bones deficient in Fra-2 and LIF are hypoxic and express increased levels of hypoxia-induced factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and Bcl-2. Overexpression of Bcl-2 is sufficient to induce giant osteoclasts in vivo, whereas Fra-2 and LIF affect HIF1alpha through transcriptional modulation of the HIF prolyl hydroxylase PHD2. This pathway is operative in the placenta, because specific inactivation of Fra-2 in the embryo alone does not cause hypoxia or the giant osteoclast phenotype. Thus placenta-induced hypoxia during embryogenesis leads to the formation of giant osteoclasts in young pups. These findings offer potential targets for the treatment of syndromes associated with increased osteoclastogenesis.","['Bozec, Aline', 'Bakiri, Latifa', 'Hoebertz, Astrid', 'Eferl, Robert', 'Schilling, Arndt F', 'Komnenovic, Vukoslav', 'Scheuch, Harald', 'Priemel, Matthias', 'Stewart, Colin L', 'Amling, Michael', 'Wagner, Erwin F']","['Bozec A', 'Bakiri L', 'Hoebertz A', 'Eferl R', 'Schilling AF', 'Komnenovic V', 'Scheuch H', 'Priemel M', 'Stewart CL', 'Amling M', 'Wagner EF']","['Research Institute of Molecular Pathology (I.M.P.), Dr. Bohr-Gasse 7, A-1030 Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080611,England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fos-Related Antigen-2)', '0 (Fosl2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Hif1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.2 (Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.11.29 (Egln1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.29 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone and Bones/cytology/metabolism/pathology', '*Cell Size', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fos-Related Antigen-2/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hypoxia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/metabolism', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-Proline Dioxygenases', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Osteoclasts/*cytology/metabolism/pathology', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', '*Signal Transduction']",2008/06/13 09:00,2008/08/14 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2007/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/14 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['nature07019 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07019 [doi]']",ppublish,Nature. 2008 Jul 10;454(7201):221-5. doi: 10.1038/nature07019.

Following 1-day DMSO treatment, HL-60 cells were committed to neutrophil differentiation with loss of their proliferative capacity, and gene expression changes were mostly related to transcription and cell cycle, including up-regulation of inhibitor of DNA binding (Id) genes and down-regulation of cyclins, CDC kinases and MCM proteins. After 3-4-day DMSO treatment, zinc finger proteins 266 and 51 (BCL-6) were dramatically up-regulated, and additional gene expression changes, involving functional and signalling proteins as well as genes involved in RNA processing, apoptosis, and protein degradation, correlated with acquisition of the mature neutrophil phenotype. Our data define changes in the gene expression pattern of a rather restricted number of genes during the differentiation process that seem to regulate neutrophil maturation, providing a molecular basis for the acquisition of neutrophil phenotype. Peripheral blood mature neutrophils showed a qualitatively similar expression profile for these selected genes. These results show changes in gene expression during the transformation of a proliferating leukaemic cell into an end apoptotic-prone cell, which might be of importance to get a molecular insight for the use of differentiation therapy in leukaemia.","['Mollinedo, Faustino', 'Lopez-Perez, Ricardo', 'Gajate, Consuelo']","['Mollinedo F', 'Lopez-Perez R', 'Gajate C']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (C.S.I.C.), Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain. fmollin@usal.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20080506,Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/genetics/metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Neutrophils/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2008/06/13 09:00,2008/09/13 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2008/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2008/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/09/13 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0378-1119(08)00169-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2008.04.015 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2008 Aug 1;419(1-2):16-26. doi: 10.1016/j.gene.2008.04.015.

Interindividual variability can result from genes involved in drug metabolism and transport, drug targets (receptors, enzymes, etc), and proteins relevant to cell survival (e.g., cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis). The purpose of the current study is to establish a flexible, cost-effective, high-throughput genotyping platform for candidate genes involved in chemoresistance and -sensitivity, and treatment outcomes. METHODS: We have adopted SNPlex for genotyping 432 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 160 candidate genes implicated in response to anticancer chemotherapy. RESULTS: The genotyping panels were applied to 39 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia undergoing flavopiridol chemotherapy, and 90 patients with colorectal cancer. 408 SNPs (94%) produced successful genotyping results. Additional genotyping methods were established for polymorphisms undetectable by SNPlex, including multiplexed SNaPshot for CYP2D6 SNPs, and PCR amplification with fluorescently labeled primers for the UGT1A1 promoter (TA)nTAA repeat polymorphism. CONCLUSION: This genotyping panel is useful for supporting clinical anticancer drug trials to identify polymorphisms that contribute to interindividual variability in drug response. Availability of population genetic data across multiple studies has the potential to yield genetic biomarkers for optimizing anticancer therapy.","['Dai, Zunyan', 'Papp, Audrey C', 'Wang, Danxin', 'Hampel, Heather', 'Sadee, Wolfgang']","['Dai Z', 'Papp AC', 'Wang D', 'Hampel H', 'Sadee W']","['Program in Pharmacogenomics, Department of Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, College of Medicine and Public Health, The Ohio State University, 5072 Graves Hall, 333 West 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210-1239, USA. dai.15@osu.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20080611,England,BMC Med Genomics,BMC medical genomics,101319628,,,,2008/06/13 09:00,2008/06/13 09:01,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2007/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2008/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/06/13 09:01 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['1755-8794-1-24 [pii]', '10.1186/1755-8794-1-24 [doi]']",epublish,BMC Med Genomics. 2008 Jun 11;1:24. doi: 10.1186/1755-8794-1-24.,,"['U01 GM061390/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 GM061390/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2442111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mostly patients suffering from underlying immune deficiency are infected with this mould, resulting in a considerably decreasing prognosis. In immunocompromised patients, cutaneous manifestations are more often associated with Fusarium sp. than with Candida sp. or Aspergillus sp. We describe one patient with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, who was first treated with chemotherapy after GMALL protocol 07/03. After relapse, the patient was successfully transplanted in second remission with a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched unrelated peripheral blood stem cell graft. Ten months later, the patient died from respiratory insufficiency and recurrence of leukaemia. Previously, Aspergillus antigen was detected in blood. In the latter course, disseminated papules appeared. One of these was examined histologically and mycologically. Conventional cultural diagnostics led to the diagnosis of a fusariosis, further supported by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, both determining the isolated strain as Fusarium proliferatum, which is a very infrequent pathogen within this genus. Our investigations underline the potential of MALDI-TOF MS based identification of Fusarium species as an innovative, time and cost efficient alternative to ITS sequencing.","['Seyfarth, Florian', 'Ziemer, Mirjana', 'Sayer, Herbert G', 'Burmester, Anke', 'Erhard, Marcel', 'Welker, Martin', 'Schliemann, Sibylle', 'Straube, Eberhard', 'Hipler, Uta-Christina']","['Seyfarth F', 'Ziemer M', 'Sayer HG', 'Burmester A', 'Erhard M', 'Welker M', 'Schliemann S', 'Straube E', 'Hipler UC']","['Klinik fur Dermatologie und Dermatologische Allergologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Jena, Germany. florian.seyfarth@med.uni-jena.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20080610,Denmark,Exp Dermatol,Experimental dermatology,9301549,"['0 (DNA, Ribosomal Spacer)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal, 5.8S)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA, Ribosomal Spacer/chemistry/*genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusarium/classification/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/*diagnosis/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Phylogeny', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 5.8S/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Skin/drug effects/microbiology/pathology', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods']",2008/06/13 09:00,2009/02/03 09:00,['2008/06/13 09:00'],"['2008/06/13 09:00 [pubmed]', '2009/02/03 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/13 09:00 [entrez]']","['EXD726 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0625.2008.00726.x [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Dermatol. 2008 Nov;17(11):965-71. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2008.00726.x.

A dendritic cell (DC) phenotype can be induced in primary human AML cells by in vitro culture in the presence of various cytokine combinations. The aim was to investigate whether this phenotypic alteration is associated with altered chemokine release. AML cells were cultured according to four protocols that have been characterized in detail for AML-DC induction: (1) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) + interleukin-4 (IL-4) days 1-14 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) for days 6-14, (2) GM-CSF + IL-4 + TNF-alpha + FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (Fl3-L) for 8 days, (3) GM-CSF + IL-4 + TNF-alpha + Flt3-L + stem cell factor (SCF) + transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) for 8 days, and (4) 25 Gy gamma-irradiation combined with culture in the presence of GM-CSF + SCF + IL-3 for 4 days. Significantly increased AML-DC release of CCL17 and CCL22 was observed for protocols 1, 2, and 3, whereas effects on CCL2-5, CXCL8, and CXCL10 differed in all protocols. Neutralization studies using a transwell migration assay demonstrated the increased level of CCL17 and CCL22 release was important for AML-DC chemotaxis of normal T cells. Induction of a dendritic AML cell phenotype is associated with an altered chemokine release profile.

In HNSCC patients, the total leukocyte count was lower and the proliferating ability of PBMCs against phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was significantly downregulated. These cells showed lower expression of the early activation marker CD69. Within this PBMC population, the proportion of CD4+, CD8+ T cells, CD3- CD56+, CD16+ NK cells and CD3+ CD56+ NK-T cells was seriously downregulated. However, the proportion of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells having suppressor function was upregulated. Other immune cells, like CD14+ monocytes/macrophages and CD20+ B cells, were also fewer in number, although this difference was not statistically significant. Assessment of the cytokine secretory status of PBMCs revealed suppressed levels of Th1 cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-12 and TNF-alpha) and elevated secretion of Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) for HNSCC PBMCs whereas just the opposite was seen for PBMCs from healthy individuals. Dysregulation in the profile of immunocompetent cells and cytokine secretion was reflected in the suppressed cytotoxic function of HNSCC PBMCs, as tested on KB (oral cancer), MCF7 (breast cancer), COLO205 (colon cancer), Jurkat (T cell leukemia), K562 (erythroleukemia) and U937 (monocytic lymphoma) cell lines.

METHODS: Forty-five female ICR mice were randomly allocated into 3 groups:(1) GnRHa+PMSG group: alarelin was give first for desensitizing the pituitary, then superovulation with PMSG; (2) PMSG group: mice were injected with PMSG only; (3) Natural cycle group: mice were given with same volume of saline. Endometrium samples were taken at 48 hours after given hCG or ovulation (control group). ER and PR in glandular cells were detected with SP immunohistochemistry semiquantitatively. Expression of LIF mRNA on endometrium was detected with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULT: The positive rate(%) and expression intense (AU) of ER and PR on glandular epithelium cells were significantly lower in GnRHa+PMSG group and PMSG group than those in natural cycle group (all P <0.01). The expression of LIF mRNA was significantly lower in GnRHa+PMSG group and PMSG group than that in natural cycle group (all P <0.01); but the expressions of ER, PR and LIF in GnRHa+PMSG group were higher than those in PMSG group. CONCLUSION: The protocol with GnRHa down regulates the expressions of ER, PR and the LIF mRNA on the mice of secretive phase endometrium, suggesting it may have an adverse effect on the endometrial receptivity in mice, but it may still be better than PMSG alone.","['Pan, Yong-Miao', 'Shi, Yi-Fu', 'Chen, Huai-Zen']","['Pan YM', 'Shi YF', 'Chen HZ']","['The Affiliated Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310006, China. panyongm@zju.edu.cn']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",,China,Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,Zhejiang da xue xue bao.

In this paper we developed a new method for predicting glycan structures from gene expression data. There are two main original aspects of the proposed method. First, we proposed to increase the number of predictable glycan structure candidates by estimating missing glycans from a global glycan structure map, which enables us to predict new glycan structures that are not stored in the database. Second, we proposed a more general scoring scheme based on real-valued gene expression intensity rather than converting it into binary information. In the result we applied the proposed method to predicting cancer-specific glycan structures from gene expression profiles for patients of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML). We confirmed that several of the predicted glycan structures successfully correspond to known cancer-specific glycan structures according to the literature, and our method outperforms the previous methods at a statistically significant level.","['Suga, Akitsugu', 'Yamanishi, Yoshihiro', 'Hashimoto, Kosuke', 'Goto, Susumu', 'Kanehisa, Minoru']","['Suga A', 'Yamanishi Y', 'Hashimoto K', 'Goto S', 'Kanehisa M']","['Bioinformatics Center, Institute for Chemical Research, Kyoto University, Gokasho, Uji, Kyoto 611-0011, Japan. suga@kuicr.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Japan,Genome Inform,Genome informatics.

The aim of present study was to analyze gene and protein expression of Ror1 in CLL cells and normal blood leukocytes. Gene expression analysis reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of ROR1 revealed that all patients with CLL (n = 100) spontaneously expressed ROR1 mRNA whereas enriched blood B and T cells as well as granulocytes from healthy donors (n = 10) were negative. A strong nonphysiological activation signal (PMA/ionomycin) was required to induce expression in vitro in normal lymphocytes. Major genomic aberrations (mutations or truncation) of ROR1 were not observed. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot using a panel of polyclonal anti-Ror antibodies as well as flow cytometry. Blood lymphocytes from 18/18 CLL patients, but none of the 10 healthy donors, expressed surface Ror1. The majority of CLL cells exhibited Ror1 surface expression (71% mean; range 36-92%) with a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 20 (range 10-45). The corresponding MFI of CD19 on CLL cells was 26 (range 9-48). There was no difference in the Ror1 protein expression comparing IgVH mutated and unmutated cases as well as progressive and nonprogressive CLL patients. Two different variants of the Ror1 protein, 105 and 130 kDa, were identified. The Ror1 protein expression in patients with CLL but not in normal leukocytes merits further studies of its role in the pathobiology of CLL, which may provide a basis for development of Ror1 directed targeted therapy.","['Daneshmanesh, Amir H', 'Mikaelsson, Eva', 'Jeddi-Tehrani, Mahmood', 'Bayat, Ali Ahmad', 'Ghods, Roya', 'Ostadkarampour, Mahyar', 'Akhondi, Mehdi', 'Lagercrantz, Svetlana', 'Larsson, Catharina', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Shokri, Fazel', 'Mellstedt, Hakan', 'Rabbani, Hodjattallah']","['Daneshmanesh AH', 'Mikaelsson E', 'Jeddi-Tehrani M', 'Bayat AA', 'Ghods R', 'Ostadkarampour M', 'Akhondi M', 'Lagercrantz S', 'Larsson C', 'Osterborg A', 'Shokri F', 'Mellstedt H', 'Rabbani H']","['Immune and Gene Therapy Lab, CCK, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23587 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Sep 1;123(5):1190-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23587.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bi20 mediated efficient and specific lysis of B-cell lines and of B cells with low CD20 expression levels that were derived from CLL patients. Remarkably, T-cell activation and tumor cell killing occurred in an entirely autologous setting without additional effector cells in 5 of 8 samples. In comparison, rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal CD20 antibody, demonstrated a significantly lower B-cell eradication rate. Additionally, Bi20, but not rituximab, upregulated the activation markers CD25 and CD69 on both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the presence of accessory immune cells. CD14(+) accessory cells and the monocyte cell line THP-1 were activated via binding of the Fc region of Bi20, given that T cells were simultaneously engaged by the antibody. Bi20 induced a strong Th1 cytokine pattern characterized by high IFN-gamma and very low IL-4 secretion.

A majority of the lymphomas expressed higher mRNA levels of CB1 and/or CB2 as compared to reactive lymphoid tissue. With the exception of MCL, which uniformly overexpresses both CB1 and CB2, the levels of cannabinoid receptors within other lymphoma entities were highly variable, ranging from 0.1 to 224 times the expression in reactive lymph nodes. Low levels of the splice variant CB1a, previously shown to have a different affinity for cannabinoids than CB1, were detected in 44% of the lymphomas, while CB1b expression was not detected. In functional studies using MCL, Burkitt lymphoma (BL), chronic lymphatic leukemia (CLL) and plasma cell leukemia cell lines, the stable anandamide analog R(+)-methanandamide (R(+)-MA) induced cell death only in MCL and CLL cells, which overexpressed both cannabinoid receptors, but not in BL.

Co-treatment with genistein increased ATO-provoked apoptosis and activated apoptosis regulatory events (Bcl-X(L) down-regulation, cytochrome c and Omi/HtrA2 release from mitochondria, XIAP decrease and caspase-8/Bid and caspase-3 activation) in U937 promonocytes and other human leukemia cell lines (HL60, THP-1, Jurkat, RPMI-8866), but not in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated non-tumor peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Genistein, alone and with ATO, stimulated reactive oxygen species generation, and apoptosis was attenuated by N-acetyl-L-cysteine and butylated hydroxyanisole. Addition of low H(2)O(2) concentrations mimicked the capacity of genistein to increase ATO-provoked apoptosis in leukemia cells, but not in PBLs. By contrast, co-treatment with genistein or H(2)O(2) failed to potentiate the toxicity of DNA-targeting agent cisplatin, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 and the histone deacetylase inhibitor MS-275. Within the here used time-period (14 hr) genistein, alone or with ATO, did not significantly affect Akt phosphorylation and NF-kappaB binding activity, nor decreased intracellular GSH content. However, it elicited N-acetyl-L-cysteine-inhibitable phosphorylation of p38-MAPK and AMPK, and apoptosis was attenuated by pharmacologic inhibitors against these kinases. The pro-oxidant capacity of genistein might be exploited to improve the efficacy of ATO as anti-leukemic agent, and perhaps the efficacy of other oxidation-based therapeutic approaches.","['Sanchez, Yolanda', 'Amran, Donna', 'Fernandez, Carlos', 'de Blas, Elena', 'Aller, Patricio']","['Sanchez Y', 'Amran D', 'Fernandez C', 'de Blas E', 'Aller P']","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genistein/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/07/19 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/07/19 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.23639 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2008 Sep 1;123(5):1205-14. doi: 10.1002/ijc.23639.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Miq (Piperaceae), was evaluated against nine human cancer cell lines (MCF-7, NCI-ADR/RES, OVCAR-3, PC-3, HT-29, NCI-H460, 786-O, UACC-62, K-562). The DCE presented antiproliferative activity with good potency against all cell lines at low concentrations (between 4.0 and 9.5 microg/mL) and with selectivity (1.55 microg/mL) for the leukemia cell line (K-652). DCE (100, 200, 300 and 400 mg/kg, ip) was also evaluated in the Ehrlich ascites tumor model. Both the survival number and the life span of the animals that died increased by at least 45 and 50%, respectively (8 animals per group), demonstrating P. umbellata extract potential anticancer activity. The results of the in vivo antitumor activity prompted the fractionation of the crude extract. The crude extract was submitted to dry column chromatography with dichloromethane-methanol (99:1). The column effluent fractions were extracted with methanol, dried under vacuum yielding fractions FR1 (less polar), FR2 (medium polarity), and FR3 (polar), which were analyzed for their growth inhibition or cytotoxic properties by a 48-h sulforhodamine B cell viability assay by measuring the total protein content. FR1 demonstrated high potency and cytotoxicity, a result compatible with the high toxicity of oxalic acid; FR2, containing 4-nerolidylcathecol, presented the lowest cytotoxic activity compared to the other two fractions but with selectivity for prostate cancer cell line; FR3, containing a mixture of steroids described in the literature as possessing various biological activities, also presented potent anticancer in vitro activity. These results suggest that P. umbellata DCE in vivo antitumor activity may be a consequence of the activity of different active principles.","['Sacoman, J L', 'Monteiro, K M', 'Possenti, A', 'Figueira, G M', 'Foglio, M A', 'Carvalho, J E']","['Sacoman JL', 'Monteiro KM', 'Possenti A', 'Figueira GM', 'Foglio MA', 'Carvalho JE']","['Departamento de Biologia Celular e Estrutural, Instituto de Biologia, Universidade Estadual de CampinasBrasilia, DF, Brasil. juliana@cpqba.unicamp.br']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '588X2YUY0A (Methylene Chloride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/*drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Male', 'Methylene Chloride/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Mice', '*Phytotherapy', 'Piperaceae/*chemistry', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2008/06/12 09:00,2008/10/07 09:00,['2008/06/12 09:00'],"['2007/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2008/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/10/07 09:00 [medline]', '2008/06/12 09:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2008000500010 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2008000500010 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2008 May;41(5):411-5. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2008000500010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main cause of morbidity and mortality is bone marrow failure, which typically arises in the first decade of life and progresses to full-blown transfusion dependence and severe neutropenia in a variable number of years. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML may arise on the background of marrow failure, although cases of patients diagnosed with MDS or overt leukaemia before the full appearance of marrow aplasia are reported. This article reviews the current options for treatment of bone marrow failure in FA and provides an algorithm for supporting decisions on treatment. The use of androgens, corticosteroids and growth factors is reviewed, as well as the results in recent cohorts of matched sibling donor haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplants and unrelated donor HSC transplants, including cord blood graft. The conditioning regimens used are analysed and commented. Up-to-date information on second tumours after HSC transplant and on experimental treatments such as gene therapy, prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis and inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines is provided.","['Dufour, C', 'Svahn, J']","['Dufour C', 'Svahn J']","[""Haematology Unit, Department of Paediatric Haemato-Oncology, G Gaslini Children's Hospital, Genova, Italy. carlodufour@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Androgens)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Androgens/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt200863 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.63 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;41 Suppl 2:S90-5. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The advantages are the rapid availability of donor cells, the possibility of using HLA-mismatched transplants and the decreased risk of acute and chronic GvHD. The Eurocord registry has collected and analyzed data on unrelated CBTs performed in European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group (EBMT) and non-EBMT centers. The literature shows that after UCBT relapse rate (RR), disease-free survival and overall survival of children with acute leukemia are similar to other hematopoietic stem cell sources (matched unrelated BM). Disease status at the time of transplantation is found in several studies to be a very important determinant of long-term outcome. In conclusion, UCB is a valuable alternative source of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in children with acute leukemia who need an allogeneic transplant, but lack a suitable sibling donor.","['Gluckman, E', 'Rocha, V']","['Gluckman E', 'Rocha V']","['Eurocord Hematology Department, APHP University Paris VII, Paris, France. elaine.gluckman@sls.aphp.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Child', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt200860 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.60 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;41 Suppl 2:S80-2. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.60.,,,PMC7091761,,,,,,,"['EBMT Paediatric, Acute Leukemia Working Parties', 'Eurocord']",,,,,,,,

In this paper, we provide practical guidelines to help define an algorithm for the treatment of children relapsing during or after first-line chemotherapy for ALL and lacking a matched sibling donor. A simultaneous search for an unrelated donor and for a cord blood unit should be started. This study focuses mainly on the effects of some factors on survival in an effort to highlight the influence that these factors have on our choices. Matching the patient for HLA-A, -B, -C and -DRB1 alleles remains the top priority: a single HLA class I or II allele mismatch has no influence on survival, while multiple mismatching for more than one class I allele and simultaneous disparities in class I and II alleles increase mortality. The impact of additional mismatches for HLA-DQ and -DP loci on survival is still controversial. Young donor age is the most important factor that has a significant effect on better survival from among several other factors, including CMV sero-status, gender and ABO. An 18- to 30-year-old, 8/8 allele-matched donor (excluding allele matching at DQB1) or for many teams 10/10 allele-matched donor; or a 4 out of 6 (considering Ag HLA-A, -B and allelic typing of DRB1) CB unit containing more than 3.0 x 10(7) nuclear cells is considered by most institutions. The choice should be made on the basis of urgency. If a donor or a CB unit is not found within an appropriate time frame, generally less than 3 months after obtention of remission, haploidentical HSCT should be offered. Some institutions consider haploidentical HSCT the second therapeutic option when a matched donor is not available.","['Lanino, E', 'Sacchi, N', 'Peters, C', 'Giardino, S', 'Rocha, V', 'Dini, G']","['Lanino E', 'Sacchi N', 'Peters C', 'Giardino S', 'Rocha V', 'Dini G']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, IRCCS G Gaslini, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Child', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Haplotypes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Remission Induction', '*Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2008/07/24 09:00,2008/08/23 09:00,['2008/07/24 09:00'],"['2008/07/24 09:00 [pubmed]', '2008/08/23 09:00 [medline]', '2008/07/24 09:00 [entrez]']","['bmt200859 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.59 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2008 Jun;41 Suppl 2:S75-9. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2008.59.,,,,,,,,,,"['EBMT Paediatric, Acute Leukemia Working Parties', 'Eurocord']",,,,,,,,

As the results of frontline and relapse protocols are improving over time, there is a strong need for prospective SCT trials, ensuring a well-standardized procedure regarding all relevant components that are potentially responsible for heterogeneity in post-SCT outcome. Therefore, in 2003, the ALL-BFM and the ALL-REZ BFM Study Group initiated a prospective, international, multicenter trial (ALL-SCT-BFM 2003). This trial will now be extended to a larger consortium, trial ALL-SCT-BFM-international (ALL-SCT-BFMi). Strict rules define HLA-typing, donor selection, conditioning regimen, GvHD prophylaxis and therapy as well as standards of supportive care to reduce treatment-related mortality and establish an early GVL effect. Moreover, comprehensive and closely reviewed documentation and serious adverse event reporting shall ensure high study quality. Case-by-case discussions of any fatal or critical course during annual meetings will improve the culture of failure management and lead to modifications of guidelines of supportive care.
