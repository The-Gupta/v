Serum cholesterol was 316 mg/dL (Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 213 mg/dL). Nilotinib was discontinued and replaced by interferon. Antiplatelet therapy and atorvastatin 40 mg/day were prescribed. Muscle pain and elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) occurred; thus, atorvastatin was replaced by ezetimibe. Afterwards, muscle pain subsided and CK reverted to normal, but 2 years later serum cholesterol was still elevated at 218 mg/dL with LDL cholesterol 126 mg/dL. Simvastatin 5 mg/day was then started, but again muscle pain occurred and CK rose to 267 U/L. Simvastatin was stopped and serum cholesterol climbed to 252 mg/dL. Creatine was prescribed and simvastatin was reintroduced. Two months later, cholesterol was 171 mg/dL, CK was 72 U/L and there was no muscle pain. This case supports the view that creatine may prevent statin-induced myopathy.","['(c) BMJ Publishing Group Limited 2018. No commercial re-use. See rights and', 'permissions.

Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have opened the door for detailed investigation of the TCR repertoire, providing paired information from TCRalpha and TCRbeta, which together determine specificity. However, a need remains for efficient methods to assess the specificity of discovered TCRs. We developed a streamlined approach for matching TCR sequences with cognate antigen through on-demand cloning and expression of TCRs and screening against candidate antigens. Here, we first demonstrate the system's capacity to identify viral-antigen-specific TCRs and compare the functional avidity of TCRs specific for a given antigen target. We then apply this system to identify neoantigen-specific TCR sequences from patients with melanoma treated with personalized neoantigen vaccines and characterize functional avidity of neoantigen-specific TCRs. Furthermore, we use a neoantigen-prediction pipeline to show that an insertion-deletion mutation in a putative chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) driver gives rise to an immunogenic neoantigen mut-MGA, and use this approach to identify the mut-MGA-specific TCR sequence. This approach provides a means to identify and express TCRs, and then rapidly assess antigen specificity and functional avidity of a reconstructed TCR, which can be applied for monitoring antigen-specific T-cell responses, and potentially for guiding the design of effective T-cell-based immunotherapies.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hu, Zhuting', 'Anandappa, Annabelle J', 'Sun, Jing', 'Kim, Jintaek', 'Leet, Donna E', 'Bozym, David J', 'Chen, Christina', 'Williams, Louise', 'Shukla, Sachet A', 'Zhang, Wandi', 'Tabbaa, Diana', 'Steelman, Scott', 'Olive, Oriol', 'Livak, Kenneth J', 'Kishi, Hiroyuki', 'Muraguchi, Atsushi', 'Guleria, Indira', 'Stevens, Jonathan', 'Lane, William J', 'Burkhardt, Ute E', 'Fritsch, Edward F', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Ott, Patrick A', 'Keskin, Derin B', 'Hacohen, Nir', 'Wu, Catherine J']","['Hu Z', 'Anandappa AJ', 'Sun J', 'Kim J', 'Leet DE', 'Bozym DJ', 'Chen C', 'Williams L', 'Shukla SA', 'Zhang W', 'Tabbaa D', 'Steelman S', 'Olive O', 'Livak KJ', 'Kishi H', 'Muraguchi A', 'Guleria I', 'Stevens J', 'Lane WJ', 'Burkhardt UE', 'Fritsch EF', 'Neuberg D', 'Ott PA', 'Keskin DB', 'Hacohen N', 'Wu CJ']",,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Toyama, Toyama, Japan.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; and."", 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; and."", 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', 'Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA; and.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180827,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cloning, Molecular/methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Melanoma/immunology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', '*T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity']",PMC6213317,,,,2018/08/29 06:00,2019/08/17 06:00,['2018/08/29 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60635-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-04-843763 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Nov 1;132(18):1911-1921. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-04-843763.

Two different types of t(16;21) translocations can be distinguished: t(16;21)(p11;q22), resulting in the FUS-ERG fusion gene; and t(16;21)(q24;q22), resulting in RUNX1-core binding factor (CBFA2T3). We collected data on clinical and biological characteristics of 54 pediatric AML cases with t(16;21) rearrangements from 14 international collaborative study groups participating in the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (I-BFM) AML study group. The AML-BFM cohort diagnosed between 1997 and 2013 was used as a reference cohort. RUNX1-CBFA2T3 (n = 23) had significantly lower median white blood cell count (12.5 x 10(9)/L, P = .03) compared with the reference cohort. FUS-ERG rearranged AML (n = 31) had no predominant French-American-British (FAB) type, whereas 76% of RUNX1-CBFA2T3 had an M1/M2 FAB type (M1, M2), significantly different from the reference cohort (P = .004). Four-year event-free survival (EFS) of patients with FUS-ERG was 7% (standard error [SE] = 5%), significantly lower compared with the reference cohort (51%, SE = 1%, P < .001). Four-year EFS of RUNX1-CBFA2T3 was 77% (SE = 8%, P = .06), significantly higher compared with the reference cohort. Cumulative incidence of relapse was 74% (SE = 8%) in FUS-ERG, 0% (SE = 0%) in RUNX1-CBFA2T3, compared with 32% (SE = 1%) in the reference cohort (P < .001). Multivariate analysis identified both FUS-ERG and RUNX1-CBFA2T3 as independent risk factors with hazard ratios of 1.9 (P < .0001) and 0.3 (P = .025), respectively. These results describe 2 clinically relevant distinct subtypes of pediatric AML. Similarly to other core-binding factor AMLs, patients with RUNX1-CBFA2T3 rearranged AML may benefit from stratification in the standard risk treatment, whereas patients with FUS-ERG rearranged AML should be considered high-risk.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Noort, Sanne', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Cuccuini, Wendy', 'Pigazzi, Martina', 'Smith, Jenny', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Hirsch, Betsy', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Locatelli, Franco', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Raimondi, Susana', 'Sonneveld, Edwin', 'Cheuk, Daniel K', 'Dworzak, Michael', 'Stary, Jan', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Arad-Cohen, Nira', 'Czogala, Malgorzata', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry', 'Zwaan, C Michel']","['Noort S', 'Zimmermann M', 'Reinhardt D', 'Cuccuini W', 'Pigazzi M', 'Smith J', 'Ries RE', 'Alonzo TA', 'Hirsch B', 'Tomizawa D', 'Locatelli F', 'Gruber TA', 'Raimondi S', 'Sonneveld E', 'Cheuk DK', 'Dworzak M', 'Stary J', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Arad-Cohen N', 'Czogala M', 'De Moerloose B', 'Hasle H', 'Meshinchi S', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink M', 'Zwaan CM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-7007', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3976-9231']","[""Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany.', 'Acute Myeloid Leukemia-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster Study Group, Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Cytogenetics, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', ""Women and Children's Health, Hematology-Oncology Laboratory, University of Padova, Padova, Italy."", 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""Children's Oncology Group, Monrovia, CA."", ""Division of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico, Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Sciences, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and.', ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Children's Cancer Research Institute and St. Anna Children's Hospital, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."", 'Czech Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, University Hospital Motol and Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Nordic Society for Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Institution for Clinical Sciences, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.', ""Pediatric Hemato-Oncology Department, Ruth Rappaport Children's Hospital, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Institute of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Seattle Children's Hospital, University of Washington, Seattle, WA;

We aimed to assess the influence of short-term and long-term ibrutinib treatment on the HLA-DR expression on CLL cells, T cells and monocytes. The immunophenotyping of CLL and immune cells in peripheral blood was performed on 16 high-risk CLL patients treated with ibrutinib. After early ibrutinib administration, the HLA-DR expression on CLL cells reduced (P = 0.032), accompanied by an increase in CLL cell counts in peripheral blood (P = 0.001). In vitro culturing of CLL cells with ibrutinib also revealed the reduction in the HLA-DR expression at protein and mRNA levels (P < 0.01). The decrease in HLA-DR on CLL cells after the first month was followed by the gradual increase of its expression by the 12th month (P = 0.001). A one-month follow-up resulted in elevated absolute counts of CD4(+) (P = 0.002) and CD8(+) (P < 0.001) T cells as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells bearing HLA-DR (P < 0.01). The long-term administration of ibrutinib was associated with the increased numbers of CD4(+) bearing HLA-DR (P = 0.006) and elevation of HLA-DR expression on all monocyte subsets (P </= 0.004). Our results provide the first evidence of the time-dependent immunomodulatory effect of ibrutinib on CLL and T cells and monocytes.

In this prospective trial we evaluated 535 AML searches from 14 participating centers with centralized donor KIR genotyping for donor selection. This represented 3% to 48% of all AML searches (median 20%) per center, totaling 3 to 172 patients (median 22) per center. Donor KIR genotype was reported at a median of 14 days after request (</=26 days for 76% of searches). In 535 searches, 2080 donors were requested for KIR genotyping (mean 4.3 per search); and a median of 1.8 (range, 0 to 4.5) per search were KIR typed. Choosing more donors for confirmatory HLA and KIR haplotype identification enriched the likelihood of finding KIR better or best donors. The search process identified a mean of 30% KIR better or best donors; the success ranged from 24% to 38% in the 11 centers enrolling >/=8 patients. More donors requested for KIR genotyping increased the likelihood of identifying KIR better or best haplotype donors. Of the 247 transplants, 9.3% used KIR best, 19% used KIR better, and 48% used KIR neutral donors while 24% used a non-KIR-tested donor. KIR genotyping did not delay transplantation. The time from search to transplant was identical for transplants using a KIR-genotyped versus a non-KIR-genotyped donor. Prospective evaluation can rapidly identify KIR favorable genotype donors, but choosing more donors per search would substantially increase the likelihood of having a KIR best or better donor available for transplantation. Transplant centers and donor registries must both commit extra effort to incorporate new characteristics (beyond HLA, age, and parity) into improved donor selection. Deliberate efforts to present additional genetic factors for donor selection will require novel procedures.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

The HEL2 group included four isoforms designated HEL2a-d. Codon-optimized genes encoding HEL1, HEL2a, and HEL2b were expressed in Escherichia coli to produce fully active soluble proteins designated rHEL1, rHEL2a, and rHEL2b. Interestingly, these lectins showed different molecular weights: approximately 15kDa for rHEL1 and approximately 120kDa for rHEL2a and rHEL2b under non-denaturing conditions. rHEL2a and rHEL2b exhibited agglutination activities, but rHEL1 did not show any agglutination activity toward animal erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity of rHEL2 lectins was strongly inhibited by glycoproteins containing mucin-type O-glycans. Glycan array analysis and isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that rHEL2 isolectins interacted strongly with O-glycans harboring the core 1 O-glycan motif, Galbeta(1,3)GalNAc. Moreover, the glycan binding specificities of rHEL2 isolectins were comparable to that of peanut agglutinin in their ability to recognize O-glycans attached to leukosialin as tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens on the surface of K562 human leukemia cells. These results indicate that rHEL2 isolectins could be used as a powerful tool for analyzing mucin-type O-glycans expressed on the surface of cancer cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the details of the mechanism are not fully understood. In this study, the apoptosis of CD4(+) T cells increased during treatment with B16-derived exosomes in vitro and in vivo, resulting in accelerated growth of melanoma cells in mice. While the release of exosomes was blocked by disrupting the expression of Rab27a, tumor growth was clearly inhibited, and the percentage of T cells in the tumor environment increased. At the same time, Western blot showed that TEX could increase the activation of caspase-3, caspase-7 and caspase-9 but not caspase-8, down-regulating the anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL-2, MCL-1 and BCL-xL in CD4(+) T cells, and indicating that the TEX activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway of CD4(+) T cells.

This myeloradicular involvement, of toxic character, is unpredictable, since these patients have repeatedly received Intrathecal chemotherapy with the same drugs without apparent injury. The toxic effect should be mainly attributed to Cytarabine and not to methotrexate, since the central nervous system lacks Cytidine deaminase, the enzyme that degrades Cytarabine. We report two patients, an 18-year-old woman and a 16 years old male, who received systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate, cytarabine) for the treatment of an acute lymphoblastic leukemia and developed, in relation to this procedure, a spinal subacute combined degeneration.

Recent clinical applications and mechanistic studies of MST are reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: MST improves complete remission rates which have no significant difference among age groups in older patients with AML. Sufficient courses of postremission therapy lead to prolonged overall survival and reduced relapse rate. MST also benefits young patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk AML who lack a human leukocyte antigen-identical donor and shows therapeutic potential extending to other malignancies. Both donor and recipient-derived T cells contribute to the antileukemic effect. Novel methods to monitor donor microchimerism and donor-recipient immune cell interaction may further unveil mechanisms of MST. SUMMARY: MST shows therapeutic efficacy to several hematological malignancies, whereas mechanistic studies still need to be promoted, and its combination with other targeted therapies is warranted to further reduce relapse rate.",,"['Cai, Bo', 'Guo, Mei', 'Ai, Huisheng']","['Cai B', 'Guo M', 'Ai H']",,"[""Department of Hematology and Transplantation, The 307th Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,,,,2018/08/28 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/08/28 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000470 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Nov;25(6):417-424. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000470.,6,417-424,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML is a heterogeneous malignancy, and investigational drugs targeting FLT3 have shown disparate effects in patients with FLT3-mutated AML, probably as a result of their inhibiting different targets and pathways at the administered doses. However, the efficacy and side effects of drugs do not just reflect the biochemical and pharmacodynamic properties of the parent compound but are often comprised of complex cooperative effects between the properties of the parent and active metabolites. Following chronic dosing, two midostaurin metabolites attain steady-state plasma trough levels greater than that of the parent drug. In this study, we characterized these metabolites and determined their profiles as kinase inhibitors using radiometric transphosphorylation assays. Like midostaurin, the metabolites potently inhibit mutant forms of FLT3 and KIT and several additional kinases that either are directly involved in the deregulated signaling pathways or have been implicated as playing a role in AML via stromal support, such as IGF1R, LYN, PDPK1, RET, SYK, TRKA, and VEGFR2. Consequently, a complex interplay between the kinase activities of midostaurin and its metabolites is likely to contribute to the efficacy of midostaurin in AML and helps to engender the distinctive effects of the drug compared to those of other FLT3 inhibitors in this malignancy.",,"['Manley, Paul W', 'Caravatti, Giorgio', 'Furet, Pascal', 'Roesel, Johannes', 'Tran, Phi', 'Wagner, Trixie', 'Wartmann, Markus']","['Manley PW', 'Caravatti G', 'Furet P', 'Roesel J', 'Tran P', 'Wagner T', 'Wartmann M']",,"['Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Oncology Disease Area, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Department of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics , Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , East Hanover , New Jersey 07936 , United States.', 'Global Discovery Chemistry, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Oncology Disease Area, Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research , Novartis International AG , CH-4002 Basel , Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180913,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BALB 3T3 Cells', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",,,,,2018/08/28 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/08/28 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00727 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Sep 25;57(38):5576-5590. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00727.

BCRs are generated through genetic recombination and can be diversified through somatic hypermutation (SHM) or class-switch recombination (CSR). Patterns of repertoire diversity can vary substantially between different health conditions. We use isotype-resolved BCR sequencing to compare B-cell evolution and class-switch fate in healthy individuals and in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We show that the patterns of SHM and CSR in B-cells from healthy individuals are distinct from CLL. We identify distinct properties of clonal expansion that lead to the generation of antibodies of different classes in healthy, malignant, and non-malignant CLL BCR repertoires. We further demonstrate that BCR diversity is affected by relationships between antibody variable and constant regions leading to isotype-specific signatures of variable gene usage.

Metformin acts by interfering with mitochondrial respiration, leading to an activation of the AMPK tumor-suppressive pathway to promote catabolic-energy saving reactions and block anabolic ones that are associated with abnormal cell proliferation. Metformin also acts at the organism level. In type 2 diabetes patients, metformin reduces hyperglycemia and increases insulin sensitivity by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in muscles, liver, and adipose tissue and by reducing glucose output by the liver. Lowering insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels that stimulate cancer growth could be important features of metformin's mode of action. Despite continuous progress in treatments with the use of targeted therapies and now immunotherapies, acute leukemias are still of very poor prognosis for relapse patients, demonstrating an important need for new treatments deriving from the identification of their pathological supportive mechanisms. In the last decade, it has been realized that if cancer cells modify and reprogram their metabolism to feed their intense biochemical needs associated with their runaway proliferation, they develop metabolic addictions that could represent attractive targets for new therapeutic strategies that intend to starve and kill cancer cells.

However, discrepancies remain regarding the association between FLT3 inhibitors use and prognosis of AML patients in clinical trials. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of FLT3 inhibitors on the treatment of AML in a systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and methods: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for studies published before August 2017 that used FLT3 inhibitors in AML. Fixed- and random-effect models were used, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed. Results: A total of 26 studies fitting our inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. The FLT3 status of patients and main treatment outcomes including overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), relapse-free survival (RFS), complete remission (CR), and overall response rate (ORR) after therapy were extracted. Five studies comparing addition of FLT3 inhibitors and placebo or blank control to chemotherapy were analyzed in Part I, showing improved OS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.75-0.99, P=0.03) in the FLT3 inhibitor group but without a significant improvement on EFS (HR=0.86, 95% CI=0.62-1.21, P=0.39) and ORR (odds ratio [OR]=1.10, 95% CI=0.89-1.35, P=0.38). Twenty-one studies evaluating the benefit of using FLT3 inhibitors in different FLT3-type AML patients were analyzed in Part II, showing that FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-positive patients were more sensitive to FLT3 inhibitor treatment and achieved better CR (OR=1.89, 95% CI=1.06-3.37, P=0.03) and ORR (OR=3.07, 95% CI=2.13-4.43, P<0.001). Conclusion: Our study showed that combined use of FLT3 inhibitors improved OS and that the FLT3 status of AML patients could affect their sensitivity to FLT3 inhibitors in terms of CR and ORR.",,"['Yang, Minglei', 'Zhao, Jian', 'Liu, Tielong', 'Yang, Xinghai', 'Wei, Haifeng', 'Xu, Wei', 'Xiao, Jianru']","['Yang M', 'Zhao J', 'Liu T', 'Yang X', 'Wei H', 'Xu W', 'Xiao J']",,"['Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.', 'Department of Orthopedic Oncology, Changzheng Hospital, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200003, China, xuweichangzheng@hotmail.com; jianruxiao83@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180814,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6097505,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-ITD', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clinical outcome', 'meta-analysis']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2018/08/28 06:00,2018/08/28 06:01,['2018/08/28 06:00'],"['2018/08/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S166387 [doi]', 'cmar-10-2635 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Aug 14;10:2635-2652. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S166387. eCollection 2018.,,2635-2652,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Secondary analysis of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 49907 prospective randomized clinical trial. SETTING: CALGB institutions in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 65 and older with Stage I to III breast cancer enrolled in CALGB 49907 who had physical function data from before and after receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy (N=256; mean age 71.5, range 65-85). MEASUREMENTS: Participants were administered the physical function subscale of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire before chemotherapy, at the end of chemotherapy, and 12 months after chemotherapy initiation. Functional decline was defined as a more than 10-point decrease from baseline at each time point. Resilience was defined as return to within 10 points of baseline. Multivariable regression was used to examine pretreatment characteristics associated with physical function changes. RESULTS: Of 42% of participants who had physical function decline from before to the end of chemotherapy, 47% recovered by 12 months (were resilient). Almost one-third experienced functional decline from before chemotherapy to 12 months later. Pretreatment fatigue was a risk factor for functional decline from before to the end of chemotherapy (P=.02). Risk factors for functional decline at 12 months included pretreatment dyspnea (P=.007) and being unmarried (P=.01). CONCLUSION: Functional decline was common in older women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in a clinical trial. Although half recovered their physical function, one-third had a clinically meaningful decline at 12 months. Strategies are needed to prevent functional decline in older adults receiving chemotherapy.

Defining the mechanisms underlying MDS HSPC maintenance is critical for developing MDS therapy. The deacetylase SIRT1 regulates stem cell proliferation, survival, and self-renewal by deacetylating downstream proteins. Here we show that SIRT1 protein levels were downregulated in MDS HSPCs. Genetic or pharmacological activation of SIRT1 inhibited MDS HSPC functions, whereas SIRT1 deficiency enhanced MDS HSPC self-renewal. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effects of SIRT1 were dependent on TET2, a safeguard against HSPC transformation. SIRT1 deacetylated TET2 at conserved lysine residues in its catalytic domain, enhancing TET2 activity. Our genome-wide analysis identified cancer-related genes regulated by the SIRT1/TET2 axis. SIRT1 activation also inhibited functions of MDS HSPCs from patients with TET2 heterozygous mutations. Altogether, our results indicate that restoring TET2 function through SIRT1 activation represents a promising means to target MDS HSPCs.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here we describe the development of CKIalpha inhibitors, which co-target the transcriptional kinases CDK7 and CDK9, thereby augmenting CKIalpha-induced p53 activation and its anti-leukemic activity. Oncogene-driving super-enhancers (SEs) are highly sensitive to CDK7/9 inhibition. We identified multiple newly gained SEs in primary mouse acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and demonstrate that the inhibitors abolish many SEs and preferentially suppress the transcription elongation of SE-driven oncogenes. We show that blocking CKIalpha together with CDK7 and/or CDK9 synergistically stabilize p53, deprive leukemia cells of survival and proliferation-maintaining SE-driven oncogenes, and induce apoptosis. Leukemia progenitors are selectively eliminated by the inhibitors, explaining their therapeutic efficacy with preserved hematopoiesis and leukemia cure potential; they eradicate leukemia in MLL-AF9 and Tet2(-/-);Flt3(ITD) AML mouse models and in several patient-derived AML xenograft models, supporting their potential efficacy in curing human leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

PC-12 cells were treated with H2 O2 to cell injury. The cells were transfected with short-hairpin RNA directed against Sox2ot (sh-Sox2ot), small interfering RNA directed against myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) isoform2 (si-MCL-1), a miR-211 mimic, a miR-211 inhibitor, and their negative controls. Under different transfected treatments, cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis as well as the expressions of apoptosis- and autophagy-related proteins were investigated. Besides, the regulatory relationships between Sox2ot and miR-211, miR-211 and MCL-1, as well as between MCL-1 and the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) signaling pathway were explored. Suppression of Sox2ot inhibited H2 O2 -induced PC-12 cell injury by increasing cell viability, migration, invasion, and decreasing apoptosis and autophagy. Moreover, suppression of Sox2ot increased miR-211 expression and alleviated H2 O2 -induced injury in PC-12 cells possibly via upregulation of miR-211. Furthermore, MCL-1 isoform2 was identified as a direct target of miR-211 and could be negatively regulated by miR-211. Suppression of miR-211 aggravated H2 O2 -induced cell injury by regulation of MCL-1 isoform2. Besides, inhibition of miR-211 suppressed the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway in H2 O2 -treated PC-12 cells, which was reversed after knockdown of MCL-1 isoform2 at the same time. Our findings indicate that downregulation of Sox2ot may protect PC-12 cells from H2 O2 -induced injury in SCI via targeting the miR-211/MCL-1 isoform2 axis. MCL-1 isoform2 may further regulate the activation of the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway to mediate H2 O2 -induced injury. The Sox2ot-miR-211-MCL-1 isoform2 axis may be a promising therapeutic strategy for SCI.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Yin, Dong', 'Zheng, Xiaoqing', 'Zhuang, Jianxiong', 'Wang, Liangze', 'Liu, Bin', 'Chang, Yunbing']","['Yin D', 'Zheng X', 'Zhuang J', 'Wang L', 'Liu B', 'Chang Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7146-2101'],"['Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, Guangdong General Hospital, Guangdong Academy of Medical Sciences, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20180826,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MIRN211 microRNA, rat)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, rat)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Movement', 'Down-Regulation', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'PC12 Cells', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa/genetics/metabolism', 'Spinal Cord Injuries/genetics/pathology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL-1', '*Sox2 overlapping transcript (Sox2ot)', '*long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)', '*miR-211', '*protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR)/p70 ribosomal S6', 'protein kinase (p70S6K) pathway', '*spinal cord injury (SCI)']",,2018/08/27 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/08/27 06:00'],"['2017/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27280 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;119(12):9675-9684. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27280.

In this novel study, we aimed to investigate the epigenetic effects of BIBR1532 on both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. K-562 human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line and U87MG glioblastoma cell line were compared with control groups without BIBR1532 treatment. Cytotoxic effects of BIBR1532 were determined by using WST-1 assay. Apoptotic effects of BIBR1532 were detected by using annexin V method. To assess expression changes in the human epigenetic chromatin modification enzyme genes, total RNA was isolated from K-562 and U87MG cells treated with BIBR1532 and untreated control cells. BIBR1532 induced 2.41-fold apoptotic cell death in U87MG cell lines compared with control groups. Apoptosis was slightly induced in K-562 cells with BIBR1532 treatment compared with control cells. We observed that BIBR1532 also regulates similar genes in both cell lines, and it is useful on epigenetic mechanisms. As a result, telomerase inhibitor BIBR1532 has a significant effect on both hematological malignancies and solid tumors.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Biray Avci, Cigir', 'Dogan, Fatma', 'Ozates Ay, Neslihan Pinar', 'Goker Bagca, Bakiye', 'Abbaszadeh, Zeka', 'Gunduz, Cumhur']","['Biray Avci C', 'Dogan F', 'Ozates Ay NP', 'Goker Bagca B', 'Abbaszadeh Z', 'Gunduz C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6856-4644'],"['Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Department of Medical Biology, Ege University Medical School, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180826,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Aminobenzoates)', '0 (BIBR 1532)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",IM,"['Aminobenzoates/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Naphthalenes/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics', 'Telomerase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BIBR1532', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*glioma']",,2018/08/27 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/08/27 06:00'],"['2018/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27301 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;119(12):9817-9824. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27301.

However, the possible effect of THZ1 on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. Our study was to investigate the roles of THZ1 in HCC cells and in subcutaneous HCC model and illustrate the molecular mechanisms. The phosphorylation levels of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 within RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) C-terminal domain (CTD) and the expression levels of Ki67, Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP, and p53 in HCC cells under different conditions were examined by Western blot analysis. Cell growth and apoptosis were assessed via 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. Tumor volume was assessed in HCC mice with THZ1 or vehicle treatment and immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis was conducted on excised tumors. THZ1 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Ser2, Ser5, and Ser7 within RNAPII-CTD in the dose-dependent and irreversible manner. MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis showed that THZ1 inhibited HCC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, respectively. Western blot analysis indicated THZ1 significantly upregulated p53 expression and downregulated the expressions of Mcl-1, survivin, XIAP, and Ki67. THZ1 suppressed tumor growth in Hep3B xenografted mice in a time-dependent manner. IHC analysis indicated that tumors in THZ1 group had less Ki67+ cells and more cleaved caspase-3+ cells than those in vehicle group. THZ1 exhibited anti-HCC effects through irreversibly inhibiting CDK7 activity, decreasing RNAPII-CTD phosphorylation, inducing p53 expression and inhibiting antiapoptotic gene expressions, which subsequently induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of HCC cells.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zhong, Liqiang', 'Yang, Sihao', 'Jia, Yuming', 'Lei, Kaijian']","['Zhong L', 'Yang S', 'Jia Y', 'Lei K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2008-3726'],"[""Department of Oncology, The Second People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin, China."", ""Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, The Second People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin, China."", ""Department of Oncology, The Second People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin, China."", ""Department of Oncology, The Second People's Hospital of Yibin, Yibin, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180826,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (THZ1 compound)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Phenylenediamines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Survivin/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*THZ1', '*antiproliferative effect', '*apoptosis-inducing effect', '*covalent cyclin-dependent kinase 7 inhibitor', '*hepatocellular carcinoma']",,2018/08/27 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/08/27 06:00'],"['2018/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27292 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;119(12):9742-9751. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27292.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the case records of 50 hospitalized patients with AML undergoing standard dose induction chemotherapy from January to December 2015. RESULTS: Out of 50 cases, 34 were males 16 females with median age of 30 years. Most common presenting symptoms were fever followed by bleeding diathesis. The clinical sites of infections were gastrointestinal tract including oral cavity (48%), respiratory tract (4%), skin/soft tissue (4%) and genitourinary tract (4%). Clinically (58%) or microbiologically (30%) documented infections were 88%, while 12% had fever without identifiable source. Overall, in 21 episodes microorganisms were isolated. Common sites of isolates were blood stream (11), stool (8), sputum (1) and urine (1). Gram negative infections accounted for 81% of total isolates; Escherichia coli (E. coli) being the commonest. Gram positive microorganisms were isolated in 19% of which methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was the most common. Gram negative bacterial infections were associated with higher mortality. CONCLUSION: Gastrointestinal tract is the most common clinical site of infection. Blood stream infection is the most common site for positive bacterial isolates. Gramnegative bacilli were the predominant cause of infections with E. coli being the most common pathogen isolated.

The results of the present study highlighted the efficacy of Aprepitant, an oral antagonist of the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R), against both APL (NB4) and pre-B ALL (Nalm-6) cell lines; however, a differential sensitivity pattern was found in these cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the molecular mechanisms of resistance to Aprepitant have been investigated and, herein, we proposed that the effectiveness of Aprepitant could be overshadowed, at least partially, through over-activated nuclear factor-kappaB in Nalm-6 pre-B ALL cells. In contrast to Nalm-6, the cytotoxic property of Aprepitant in NB4 was divulged at the lower concentrations. Of particular interest, we found that the cytotoxicity of the inhibitor became even more evident in the synergistic experiments, where an enhanced reduction in viability was noted after treatment of NB4 cells with ATO-plus-Aprepitant. The stimulatory effect of NK1R inhibition on ATO cytotoxicity is probably mediated through up-regulation of p73, which can subsequently engage p21 and NF-kappaB pathway via transcriptional suppression of c-Myc. Taken together, the present study suggests that inhibition of NK1R using Aprepitant, either alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs, could be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute leukemia, especially APL, that may be clinically accessible in the near future.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Classically, T cell-depleted grafts were associated with reduction of the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect because of delayed T cell immune reconstitution. However, natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity is also critical for an early GVL effect as well as for lymphocyte immune reconstitution. Here, we study the role of NK cells in MRD T cell-depleted HSCT, which is still poorly understood. Given that MRD ligands for inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are matched, we focused on activating KIR receptors. We retrospectively analyzed KIR genotyping in patients and MRDs in 40 ex vivo T cell-depleted pediatric HSCTs. The log-rank test and Cox proportional risk test were performed to correlate genotype with clinical outcome (relapse rate, disease-free survival, and overall survival) and immune reconstitution. The statistical analysis revealed poorer overall survival when donors have a KIR-B content score of >/=2, a best/better subtype, or present the KIR2DS1 gene. The patient's relapse rate was higher when donors present the KIR2DL5A gene, as well as a poorer probability of disease-free survival when the donor is classified with a best/better subtype. Regarding immune reconstitution, donor KIR haplotype A or the presence of inhibitory KIR genes promote best recovery of T lymphocytes, whereas donor KIR haplotype B or the presence of activating KIR genes confer better expansion of NK cells. These findings suggest that the selection of MRDs with an inhibitory KIR phenotype improve T cell expansion as well as the clinical outcome after pediatric ex vivo T cell-depleted HSCT.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

We performed a systematic review to assess the totality of evidence pertaining to the efficacy of allo-HCT in BPDCN. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane, PubMed, and Embase databases through January 5, 2018, for studies on allo-HCT for BPDCN. Two authors independently reviewed all references for inclusion and extracted data related to benefits (overall [OS] and progression-free/disease-free [PFS/DFS] survival) and harms (relapse and nonrelapse mortality) from included studies. When appropriate, data were pooled using random-effects model. RESULTS: Four studies (128 patients) were included in analysis. Pooled OS rate was 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 41-59) for all patients. Among patients who underwent allografting whose disease was in first complete remission (CR1), pooled OS and PFS/DFS rates were 67% (95% CI, 52-80) and 53% (95% CI, 29-76), respectively. For patients who underwent allografting in > CR1, pooled OS and PFS/DFS rates were 7% (95% CI, 0-32) for both outcomes. Relapse rates were higher when reduced-intensity regimens were used (40% [95% CI, 25-56] vs. 18% [95% CI, 7-31]). CONCLUSION: This systematic review represents the best available evidence supporting allo-HCT in BPDCN, especially when offered in CR1. Use of myeloablative allo-HCT results in lower pooled relapse rates (18% vs. 40%). A prospective comparative study will be needed to determine the impact of intensity of the conditioning regimen on postallograft relapse.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We recently identified CNOT3 loss-of-function mutations in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). METHODS: Here, we use different Drosophila melanogaster eye cancer models to study the potential tumor suppressor function of Not3, the CNOT3 orthologue, and other members of the CCR4-NOT complex. RESULTS: Our data show that knockdown of Not3, the structural components Not1/Not2, and the deadenylases twin/Pop2 all result in increased tumor formation. In addition, overexpression of Not3 could reduce tumor formation. Not3 downregulation has a mild but broad effect on gene expression and leads to increased levels of genes involved in DNA replication and ribosome biogenesis. CycB upregulation also contributes to the Not3 tumor phenotype. Similar findings were obtained in human T-ALL cell lines, pointing out the conserved function of Not3.

GVHD occurs when donor lymphocytes are activated by inflammatory cytokines and alloantigens. The role of donor biologic characteristics, such as basal inflammation, has not been investigated as a risk factor for GVHD but is theoretically transferrable to the recipient. We evaluated donor serum and plasma concentrations of cytokines and adipokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, leptin, suppression of tumorigenicity-2, and adiponectin) from test (n=210) and replication (n=250) cohorts of matched, unrelated transplant peripheral blood stem cell recipients identified through the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation Research between 2000 and 2011 for hematologic malignancies. Hazard ratios were estimated for acute (grades II to IV and III to IV) and chronic GVHD, overall survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse for each cytokine or adipokine, adjusting for significant covariates. The lowest cytokine quartile was considered as the reference group for each model. To account for multiple testing P < .01 was considered the threshold for significance. In the test cohort a borderline significant association was identified between donor serum IL-1beta concentrations and grades III to IV acute GVHD in the recipient (P = .01), and a significant inverse association was identified between donor TNF-alpha concentrations and chronic GVHD (P = .006). These findings were not validated in the replication cohort. Although the initial associations between cytokine levels and allo-HCT outcomes were not validated, the idea that donor characteristics may be transferable to the recipient remains an exciting area for future research.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

We report for the first time compound heterozygote germline missense DDX41 mutations located in the DEAD-box domain, identified in two siblings by exome sequencing. Both siblings have slight dysmorphic findings, psychomotor delays and intellectual disability, and one developed blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) at age five. RNA-sequencing of bone marrow showed DDX41 expression including both mutations. However, the allele fraction of p.Pro321Leu accounted for 96% in the RNA-sequencing indicating this mutation to be the more significant variant. Exome sequencing of the leukemic blasts identified no additional known driver mutations. There is no pattern indicating autosomal dominantly inherited cancer predisposition in the family, but the father has sarcoidosis, which has been associated with heterozygous DDX41 mutation.

However, the risk factors and predictive markers remain unclear for this complication. This retrospective study aims to explore whether the change of absolute monocyte count (AMC) during immunochemotherapy is correlated with IP occurrence and progression. A total of 500 lymphoma patients receiving immunochemotherapy from 2014 to 2016 were enrolled in this investigation. Interstitial pneumonia was generally diagnosed as diffused pulmonary interstitial infiltrates on computed tomography images in conjunction with respiratory symptoms or pulmonary function test, which is also adopted as a diagnosing tool of IP in this study. Among the total 500 participating patients, 40 patients were diagnosed as IP, which account for 8% of the total subjects. The median number of chemotherapy cycles for those patients prior to IP occurrence is 4. This research suggests that the increase of peripheral AMC over 0.565 x 10(9) /L after 2 cycles of immunochemotherapy is a great potential to develop IP. Using the method of multivariate analysis, lymphoma lung involvement and high AMC after 2 cycles of immunochemotherapy were identified as independent risk factors for IP. Most IP patients with sustained AMC elevation (>0.575 x 10(9) /L at IP onset) accompanied severe pulmonary symptoms, while those with AMC fall-back might tolerate subsequent immunochemotherapy. Thus, this study concludes that early increase of AMC during immunochemotherapy in lymphoma patients with lung involvement suggested a great potential to develop IP. Dynamic changes in AMC may serve as a predictive marker for IP severity and a guide for treatment adjustment for both tumor and pulmonary injuries.","['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Lang, Mingxiao', 'Yu, Jingwei', 'Wang, Xianhuo', 'Song, Zheng', 'Li, Lanfang', 'Qiu, Lihua', 'Zhang, Huilai']","['Lang M', 'Yu J', 'Wang X', 'Song Z', 'Li L', 'Qiu L', 'Zhang H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7216-060X'],"['National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.', 'National Clinical Research Center for Cancer; Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Sino-US Center for Lymphoma and Leukemia, Department of Lymphoma, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180919,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/*blood/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Lymphoma/*blood/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monocytes', 'Predictive Value of Tests']",,['NOTNLM'],"['absolute monocyte count', 'interstitial pneumonia', 'lymphoma', 'predictive marker', 'risk factors']",,2018/08/26 06:00,2018/12/21 06:00,['2018/08/26 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2556 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2018 Dec;36(5):779-785. doi: 10.1002/hon.2556.

Here, we report two cases of KMT2A-rearranged infantile AML masquerading as JMML at initial presentation. Both cases showed leukocytosis accompanied by atypical monocytosis. However, in both cases, leukemic blasts were absent at the initial examination. Thus, a diagnosis of JMML was suspected. However, initial cytogenetic analysis revealed that both cases had an 11q23 rearrangement, which is atypical in JMML. Eventually, due to the emergence of leukemic blasts and further cytogenetic studies, both cases were diagnosed with infantile AML with a KMT2A rearrangement. Although one patient remains in complete remission after the completion of AML appropriate chemotherapy, the other died of AML due to treatment failure. Our experience suggests that AML with KMT2A rearrangement should be considered for the differential diagnosis of infantile cases with atypical monocytosis suggestive of JMML.

Relapse is the main cause of treatment failure for patients with relapsed/refractory disease or with very high-risk gene mutations such as TP53, TET2, and DNMT3a. In this study, we aimed to establish the tolerance and efficacy of prophylactic donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) with G-CSF-primed peripheral blood progenitors for prevention of relapse in these very high-risk patients after haplo-PBSCT. The prophylactic DLI was given at a median of 77 days after transplantation in 31 of 45 consecutive patients with very high-risk leukemia/lymphoma. The median dose of CD3(+) cells for infusion was 1.8 x 10(7)/kg. The 100-day incidences of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades 2-4 and 3-4 after DLI were 55.3% and 10.2%. The 2-year incidences of chronic GVHD and severe chronic GVHD were 52.0% and 18.2%. The 2-year incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse were 33.1% and 32.5%. The 2-year probabilities of overall survival and relapse-free survival were 40.1% and 31.9%. Poor-risk gene mutations (p = 0.029), disease in non-remission status prior to transplantation (p = 0.005), and donors older than 40 years of age (p = 0.043) were associated with relapse after DLI. In multivariate analysis, disease in non-remission status prior to transplantation was an independent risk factor of relapse (hazard ratio = 4.079; p = 0.035).

Nevertheless, important aspects of human disease are imperfectly approximated in mouse models, notably the involvement of endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Replication-defective ERVs, present in both humans and mice, may affect tumor development and antitumor immunity through mechanisms not involving infection. Here, we revealed an adverse effect of murine ERVs with restored infectivity on the behavior of mouse cancer models. In contrast to human cancer, where infectious ERVs have never been detected, we found that ERV infectivity was frequently restored in transplantable, as well as genetic, mouse cancer models. Such replication-competent, ERV-derived retroviruses were responsible for unusually high expression of retroviral nucleic acids and proteins in mouse cancers. Infectious ERV-derived retroviruses produced by mouse cancer cells could directly infect tumor-infiltrating host immune cells and fundamentally modified the host's immune defenses to cancer, as well as the outcome of immunotherapy.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) is the only potentially curative therapy available. Eight hundred and two adults with sAML and prior MDS/MPN who received a first HCT between 2000 and 2016 were included in the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) Acute Leukemia Working Party (ALWP) study. Median age of the cohort was 59.6 years (range, 18.6-78.6 years). Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) was given to 40% of patients, and 60% received reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). Overall, the 2-year cumulative incidence of relapse (RI) was 37%, leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 40%, overall survival (OS) was 46%, nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was 23%, and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was 39%. In univariate analysis, a statistical difference between conditioning regimens 6 months after HCT in favor of the MAC group was noted with regard to RI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.47; P = .03), LFS (HR, 1.43; P = .01), and OS (HR, 1.55; P < .05). There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of NRM (HR, 1.38; P = .15). This effect was similarly seen in multivariate analysis (MVA): cumulative incidence of relapse (HR, 1.79; P < .05), LFS (HR, 1.43; P = .02), and OS (HR, 1.53; P = .005) with no difference in NRM (HR, 1; P = .98).

To derive a more precise estimation of the association, we conducted a meta-analysis. A systematic search of the PubMed database was performed. A total of 55 separate studies including 22072 cancer cases and 25433 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. We found a significant association between CYP3A4*1B and cancer risk in the overall population in dominant model (AG+GG vs. AA: OR=1.142, 95% CI=1.006-1.295). No significant association was found in recessive model (GG vs. AG+AA: OR=1.156, 95% CI=0.941-1.419), heterozygous model (AG vs. AA: OR=1.109, 95% CI=0.977-1.259), or homozygous model (GG vs. AA: OR=1.213, 95% CI=0.950-1.549). We performed subgroup meta-analysis based on the difference of ethnicity and cancer type. Ethnic subgroup analyses revealed no significant associations of African or Caucasian ethnicities in any genetic models. In the subgroup analysis by Cancer types, we observed an increased risk for leukemia in dominant model and heterozygous model. Excluding studies with controls not in HWE, a significant association was found in dominant model and heterozygous model. In summary, this meta-analysis suggests that the CYP3A4*1B polymorphism might play a modest role in susceptibility to cancer, especially for leukemia.","['(c) 2018 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']","['Zheng, Yuan', 'Xu, Yi', 'Zhou, Bu-Yu', 'Sun, Liang', 'Yu, Peng-Bo', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Xu, Jing', 'Wang, Jing-Jun']","['Zheng Y', 'Xu Y', 'Zhou BY', 'Sun L', 'Yu PB', 'Zhang L', 'Xu J', 'Wang JJ']",,"[""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China 860107810@qq.com."", ""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China."", ""Medical Device Testing Center of Shaanxi Province, Xi'an, China."", 'Fuyang Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Fuyang, China.', ""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China."", ""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China."", ""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China."", ""Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, Xi'an, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",,United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,['EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)'],IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Heterozygote', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Publication Bias', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CYP3A4 polymorphism', 'Cancer', 'Meta-analysis', 'Susceptibility']",,2018/08/26 06:00,2018/11/18 06:00,['2018/08/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/18 06:00 [medline]']",['48/4/538 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2018 Jul;48(4):538-545.,4,538-545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In small veins and in the pediatric population, successful venous puncture is sometimes followed by resistance in passing the wire. The needle seems to miss the small vein during syringe dismounting, wire mounting and wire advancement through the needle. This work describes a ""wire-loaded puncture"" technique as a solution for this problem. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Paediatric cancer patients who needed venous access for different indications were included in the study. The wire-loaded technique is described in detail, with special emphasis on the pitfalls of needle guidance under ultrasound in the ""out of plane"" technique. One-hundred and thirty-nine (139) procedures were initially included using different ultrasound and different access sets. Different operators have participated in the work. Data of patients were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: One-hundred and thirty-nine (139) paediatric cancer patients were initially included in the study. After exclusion of patients with inaccurate data registration, the number of patients decreased to 132. The most common primary pathology was leukemia, 47 cases (33.8%), and Porta-cath was the most commonly used catheter in 70 (50.3%) cases. The right internal jugular vein (IJV) was the most commonly used vein for access in 111 (79.8%) cases. The access was feasible in 130 out of 132 cases from a single puncture. No procedure related complications were recorded. CONCLUSION: The ""wire-loaded puncture"" technique is a useful technique, particularly in small veins overcoming the relatively common problem of ""resisting wire"" after a successful vein entry. The technique has a reasonable learning curve and has shown to be reproducible by different operators, machines and venous access sets. A high resolution ultrasound machine is recommended.","['Copyright (c) 2018 National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. Production and', 'hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Meanwhile, the adverse events of HMAs have become an increasing concern. There is, however, no systematic meta-analysis available to evaluate overall hematologic toxicities for HMAs. In this meta-analysis, we aim to determine the risk of hematologic toxicities in patients treated with HMAs. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Clinical Trials. gov databases incepted to February 2018. All phase II and III trials meeting the inclusion criteria included adequate safety data. We calculated the relative risk (RR) of high-grade hematologic toxicities (HTEs) with corresponding 95% CI using Review Manager. The incidences of HTEs were also evaluated by R. Heterogeneity was calculated and reported mainly via I analyses. RESULTS: A total of 2337 MDS or AML patients from 14 studies were identified in this meta-analysis. The overall incidences of high-grade hematologic toxicities in patients who received HMAs were: 27% of the patients with anemia, 45% with neutropenia, 38% with thrombocytopenia, and 25% with febrile neutropenia, respectively. There was a significantly increased RR of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia using HMAs, in comparison with conventional care regimens (CCR) based on the drug type (decitabine vs azacitidine). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of HMAs are associated with an increased risk of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in MDS or AML patients, and our results also demonstrate that HMAs exposure does not significantly increase the risk of high-grade anemia, leukopenia, or febrile neutropenia compared with CCR.",,"['Gao, Chong', 'Wang, Jia', 'Li, Ya', 'Zhao, Huan', 'Li, Ruibai', 'Hou, Li', 'Zhang, Yayue', 'Tian, Shaodan', 'Liang, Huan', 'Wang, Chong', 'Chen, Xinyi', 'Wang, Jing']","['Gao C', 'Wang J', 'Li Y', 'Zhao H', 'Li R', 'Hou L', 'Zhang Y', 'Tian S', 'Liang H', 'Wang C', 'Chen X', 'Wang J']",,"['Department of Oncology and Hematology, Dongzhimen Hospital, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine, Dongcheng District Cross Slope Community Health Service Station, Dongcheng District Community Health Service Management Center, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",,United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*adverse effects', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', 'Risk']",PMC6112947,,,,2018/08/26 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2018/08/26 06:00'],"['2018/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000011860 [doi]', '00005792-201808240-00031 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2018 Aug;97(34):e11860. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000011860.,34,e11860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) occurs when CLL cells infiltrate lymph nodes and other tissues but spare peripheral blood and bone marrow. Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is an indolent cutaneous CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by papules and nodules that develop and spontaneously regress over weeks to months. METHODS: An 84-year-old man with CLL who developed LyP is described. The features of other patients who concurrently had both of these conditions are reviewed. RESULTS: A man was diagnosed with CLL at age 50 years. At 84 years of age, he presented with red papules on his buttocks, which demonstrated a CD30+ lymphoproliferative disorder on biopsy. Correlation of the lesion history, morphology, and histopathology established the diagnosis of LyP. LyP and CLL/SLL, including in this patient, has only been reported in 11 individuals, to our knowledge. CONCLUSION: The concurrent expression of LyP and CLL/SLL is rare. Since the conditions derive from different lymphocyte subsets, the concurrent expression may be merely coincidental. However, the development of both conditions in the same individual may provide additional insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders.",,"['Cheng, Joyce Y', 'Cohen, Phillip R']","['Cheng JY', 'Cohen PR']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California. cheng.joyce.y@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20180515,United States,Dermatol Online J,Dermatology online journal,9610776,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Buttocks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphomatoid Papulosis/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,,,,2018/08/26 06:00,2018/12/15 06:00,['2018/08/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Dermatol Online J. 2018 May 15;24(5).,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effects of two n-3 PUFAs, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), in AML cell lines and primary AML blasts. EPA and DHA induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability in five AML cell lines, which was also observed with FO, but not SO (devoid of n-3 PUFAs) in cell lines and primary leucoblasts. Mitochondrial energy metabolism shifted from oxidative respiration to glycolytic metabolism in the U937, MOLM-13, and HL-60 cell lines. This phenomenon was associated with major disorganization of the mitochondrial network and mitochondrial swelling. Transcriptomic analysis after 6 h and 24 h of exposure to FO revealed a Nrf2 activation signature, which was confirmed by evidence of Nrf2 nuclear translocation in response to oxidative stress, but insufficient to prevent cell death following prolonged exposure. Apoptosis studies showed consistent phosphatidylserine exposition among the AML cell lines tested and a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. The cell-killing effect of FO was additive with that of cytarabine (AraC), by the Chou and Talalay method, and this combination effect could be reproduced in primary AML blasts. Altogether, our results show deleterious effects of n-3 PUFAs on mitochondrial metabolism of AML cells, associated with oxidative stress and Nrf2 response, leading to cell death. These observations support further investigation of n-3 PUFA addition to standard chemotherapy in AML.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in mediating pathogen-specific immunity and are the first donor-derived lymphocytes reconstituted post-HSCT. However, NK cells vary at different stages after HSCT. Here, we found that the absolute NKG2A(+) subset cell counts and the percentages of NKG2A(+) among NK cells were significantly reduced in GVHD patients after HSCT compared with those from non-GVHD patients. Moreover, the reduction in NKG2A(+) NK cells in post-HSCT GVHD patients was ascribed to increased apoptosis and a decreased proliferation capacity while retaining a strong graft-versus-leukemia effect. In vitro assays showed that co-culture of T cells with NKG2A(+) NK cells significantly reduced IFN-gamma secretion by T cells and increased IL-4 secretion. Moreover, the CD25 expression level was decreased, whereas the number of cells with the CD4(+)CD25(+)FOXP3(+) phenotype was increased. In addition, the NKG2A(+) NK cells induced T cell apoptosis and decreased T cell proliferation during the co-culture process. Importantly, NKG2A(+) NK cells mainly regulated activated but not resting T cells. In vivo assays showed that the serologic IL-10 level was evidently lower in GVHD than in non-GVHD patients, whereas the IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were higher in GVHD patients. Furthermore, the NKG2A(+) NK cell ratio from GVHD patients was markedly increased by the presence of exogenous IL-10 but not by other cytokines. In contrast, the NKG2A(+) cell ratio from non-GVHD patients was not increased by IL-10. Therefore, post-HSCT GVHD may be ascribed to the reduced induction of NKG2A(+) NK cells by IL-10, which further overactivates T cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Applying the personalized risk score (0 to 3), the relapse cumulative incidence was 70 +/- 5% in patients with a score of 3 (without GVHD and in the advanced phase) compared with 6 +/- 4% in patients with a score of 0 (with chronic GVHD and in an early phase). This score has been verified in the validation set. With a median follow-up of 54 months, the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival rate were 37 +/- 3% and 45 +/- 4%, respectively. The association of GVHD with the graft-versus-leukemia effect is clearly established in our study, and the form of GVHD associated with less relapse and the best DFS is the classical form of chronic GVHD according to the National Institutes of Health classification. The proposed relapse risk score was validated in an independent cohort and allows personalization of the prognosis.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

CD4+ T cell activation during HIV-1 infection eliminates the antiviral function of the restriction factor SAMHD1, allowing proviral integration and the reservoir establishment. The role of tyrosine kinases during T-cell activation is essential for these processes. Therefore, the inhibition of tyrosine kinases could control HIV-1 infection and restrict the formation of the reservoir. A family of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is successfully used in clinic for treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The safety and efficacy against HIV-1 infection of five TKIs was assayed in PBMCs isolated from CML patients on prolonged treatment with these drugs that were infected ex vivo with HIV-1. We determined that the most potent and safe TKI against HIV-1 infection was dasatinib, which preserved SAMHD1 antiviral function and avoid T-cell activation through TCR engagement and homeostatic cytokines. Imatinib and nilotinib showed lower potency and bosutinib was quite toxic in vitro. Ponatinib presented similar profile to dasatinib but as it has been associated with higher incidence of arterial ischemic events, dasatinib would be the better choice of TKI to be used as adjuvant of ART in order to avoid the establishment and replenishment of HIV-1 reservoir and move forward towards an HIV cure.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

KIT gene mutations are found in approximately 80% of GISTs, and most of these mutations occur in exon 9 and exon 11. Imatinib has been successfully used as a first-line treatment for advanced GIST, with a significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. However, disease progression might develop due to primary or secondary resistance to imatinib. Sunitinib and regorafenib have been approved as second- and third-line treatments for advanced GIST patients, with median PFS values of 6.8 and 4.8 months, respectively. However, these relatively modest improvements in PFS underscore the need for more effective KIT inhibitors. BPR1J373 is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor that has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of KIT-driven acute myeloid leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we found that BPR1J373 inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis by targeting KIT in GIST cells with KIT gene mutations. BPR1J373 also induced cell cycle arrest and senescent change in KIT-mutant GIST48 cells, probably by targeting aurora kinase A. In the KIT-null COS-1 cell-based system, BPR1J373 effectively inhibited KIT with single or double mutations of KIT developed in GIST. The antiproliferative effect was also consistently evident in GIST430 tumor-grafted mice. The results suggest that BPR1J373 could be a potential anticancer drug for GIST and deserves further investigation for clinical applications.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Up- or downregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is strongly associated with the formation and progression of many malignancies. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) is a significantly upregulated lncRNA in AML. Antisense locked nucleic acid (LNA) GapmeRs oligonucleotides are the novel tools for targeting lncRNAs. The purpose of the current study was to investigate the functional role of PVT1 antisense LNA GapmeRs on AEL cell line (KG-1). Materials and Methods: AEL cells were transfected with PVT1 antisense LNA GapmeRs at three different time points. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was accomplished to evaluate the PVT1 expression by PVT1 antisense LNA GapmeRs. The viability was evaluated by MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay, and the apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by Annexin V/propidium iodide staining assay. The C-MYC expression level, the target gene of PVT1, was also quantified by qRT-PCR. Results: The results indicated that PVT1 inhibition could significantly decrease the viability of AEL cells, due to induction of apoptosis and necrosis, probably through the downregulation of C-MYC. Conclusions: Their findings suggest that the inhibition of lncRNA PVT1 could serve as a novel approach for controlling the proliferation of AEL cells and could open up a path for treatment of AEL.",,"['Salehi, Mahsa', 'Sharifi, Mohammadreza', 'Bagheri, Marzieh']","['Salehi M', 'Sharifi M', 'Bagheri M']",,"['Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics and Molecular Biology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180824,United States,Cancer Biother Radiopharm,Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals,9605408,"['0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (PVT1 long-non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (locked nucleic acid)', 'Acute erythroleukemia']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Necrosis', 'Oligonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute erythroleukemia', 'antisense LNA GapmeRs', 'lncRNA', 'long noncoding RNA']",,2018/08/25 06:00,2020/02/07 06:00,['2018/08/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/cbr.2018.2510 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biother Radiopharm. 2019 Aug;34(6):371-379. doi: 10.1089/cbr.2018.2510.

Physical degradation via protein aggregation is a major concern when developing protein therapeutic candidates for clinical use. A dimer is perhaps the simplest element of protein aggregation, and thus, a better understanding of protein dimers in terms of their structures, intermolecular interactions, and chemical nature will help in the development of rational strategies for reducing aggregation propensity. In this study, two different mAb dimers were generated from an IgG2 monoclonal antibody solution, i.e., a native dimer generated under long-term storage and a thermal dimer from a thermal stress condition. Both IgG2 dimers were characterized in terms of their chemical and physical properties, bioactivity, and conformational dynamics. The native IgG2 dimer was formed mainly through noncovalent association. It displayed minimal differences in biophysical properties and higher-order structure compared to the monomer yet showed compromised in vitro potency, likely because of steric hindrance. In contrast, the thermal IgG2 dimer was mainly disulfide-linked, but even so, no new non-native disulfide bonds were detected by peptide mapping. Two regions within the Fc-CH2 domain of the thermal IgG2 dimer exhibited significantly increased flexibility as measured by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and notably, these regions are connected by an intrachain disulfide bond under natively folded conditions. These findings provide a better understanding of dimer formation under long-term storage and thermal stress conditions for this IgG2 mAb, and possible aggregation mechanisms are discussed.",,"['Zhang, Jun', 'Woods, Christopher', 'He, Feng', 'Han, Mei', 'Treuheit, Michael J', 'Volkin, David B']","['Zhang J', 'Woods C', 'He F', 'Han M', 'Treuheit MJ', 'Volkin DB']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1272-8894'],"['Process Development , Amgen Inc. , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.', 'Process Development , Amgen Inc. , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Macromolecule and Vaccine Stabilization Center , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66049 , United States.', 'Process Development , Amgen Inc. , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.', 'Pharmacokinetics & Drug Metabolism , Amgen Inc. , South San Francisco , California 94080 , United States.', 'Process Development , Amgen Inc. , Thousand Oaks , California 91320 , United States.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Macromolecule and Vaccine Stabilization Center , University of Kansas , Lawrence , Kansas 66049 , United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180905,United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*chemistry/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Conformation', '*Protein Multimerization', 'Proteolysis', 'Receptors, Antigen/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,,2018/08/25 06:00,2019/07/06 06:00,['2018/08/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00575 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2018 Sep 18;57(37):5466-5479. doi: 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00575.

The indole scaffold has been recognized as an important scaffold in the design of novel compounds acting as antimitotic agents. Indole-based chalcones, in which one of the aryl rings was replaced by an indole, have been explored in the last few years for their anticancer potential in different cancer cell lines. Eighteen novel (3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-indolyl-propenone derivatives with general structure 9 were synthesized and evaluated for their antiproliferative activity against a panel of four different human cancer cell lines. The highest IC50 values were obtained against the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cell line. This series of chalcone derivatives was characterized by the presence of a 2-alkoxycarbonyl indole ring as the second aryl system attached at the carbonyl of the 3-position of the 1-(3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl)-2-propen-1-one framework. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the indole-based chalcone derivatives was investigated by varying the position of the methoxy group, by the introduction of different substituents (hydrogen, methyl, ethyl or benzyl) at the N-1 position and by the activity differences between methoxycarbonyl and ethoxycarbonyl moieties at the 2-position of the indole nucleus. The antiproliferative activity data of the novel synthesized compounds revealed that generally N-substituted indole analogues exhibited considerably reduced potency as compared with their parent N-unsubstituted counterparts, demonstrating that the presence of a hydrogen on the indole nitrogen plays a decisive role in increasing antiproliferative activity. The results also revealed that the position of the methoxy group on the indole ring is a critical determinant of biological activity. Among the synthesized derivatives, compound 9e, containing the 2-methoxycarbonyl-6-methoxy-N-1H-indole moiety exhibited the highest antiproliferative activity, with IC50 values of 0.37, 0.16 and 0.17 muM against HeLa, HT29 and MCF-7 cancer cell lines, respectively, and with considerably lower activity against HL-60 cells (IC50: 18 muM). This derivative also displayed cytotoxic properties (IC50 values approximately 1 muM) in the human myeloid leukemia U-937 cell line overexpressing human Bcl-2 (U-937/Bcl-2) via cell cycle progression arrest at the G2-M phase and induction of apoptosis. The results obtained also demonstrated that the antiproliferative activity of this molecule is related to inhibition of tubulin polymerisation. The presence of a methoxy group at the C5- or C6-position of the indole nucleus, as well as the absence of substituents at the N-1-indole position, contributed to the optimal activity of the indole-propenone-3',4',5'-trimethoxyphenyl scaffold.",,"['Preti, Delia', 'Romagnoli, Romeo', 'Rondanin, Riccardo', 'Cacciari, Barbara', 'Hamel, Ernest', 'Balzarini, Jan', 'Liekens, Sandra', 'Schols, Dominique', 'Estevez-Sarmiento, Francisco', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Preti D', 'Romagnoli R', 'Rondanin R', 'Cacciari B', 'Hamel E', 'Balzarini J', 'Liekens S', 'Schols D', 'Estevez-Sarmiento F', 'Quintana J', 'Estevez F']",,"['a Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'a Department of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Ferrara , Ferrara , Italy.', 'b Screening Technologies Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research , National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health , Frederick , MD , USA.', 'c Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven , Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy , Leuven , Belgium.', 'c Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven , Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy , Leuven , Belgium.', 'c Rega Institute for Medical Research, KU Leuven , Laboratory of Virology and Chemotherapy , Leuven , Belgium.', 'd Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Institute in Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS) , University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC) , Spain.', 'd Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Institute in Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS) , University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC) , Spain.', 'd Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Institute in Biomedical and Health Sciences (IUIBS) , University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (ULPGC) , Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,England,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem,Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,101150203,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6116705,['NOTNLM'],"['Microtubule', 'apoptosis', 'indole derivatives', 'structure-activity relationship', 'tumour cell growth']",,2018/08/25 06:00,2018/09/08 06:00,['2018/08/25 06:00'],"['2018/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14756366.2018.1493473 [doi]'],ppublish,J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem. 2018 Dec;33(1):1225-1238. doi: 10.1080/14756366.2018.1493473.,1,1225-1238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, a distinct variation in both incidence and type distribution was reported between countries. Aim: To estimate the incidence and mortality rates of childhood cancer in Basrah, Iraq during 2012-2016. Methods: This registry based descriptive study included children aged 0-14 years with primary cancer who were newly diagnosed in Basrah during 2012-2016. The types of malignant tumors were classified according to International Classification of Childhood Cancer, Version 3 (ICCC-3). The overall and specific incidence and mortality rates by age and sex were calculated per 100,000 population. Results: A total of 723 new cases of childhood cancer were registered during the five- year study period, with a male to-female ratio of 1.2/1. Children aged <4 years accounted for 43.1% of patients. The overall incidence rate was 13.74/100,000, and the age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was 13.87/100,000. Boys showed higher incidence rate than girls (14.78 vs. 12.66/100,000). Leukemia was the most common type of childhood cancer accounting for 35.4%, followed by lymphoma (17.8%), and central nervous system tumors 11.9%. The overall cancer-specific mortality rate was 6.04/100,000 and the ASMR was 6.08/100,000 children.

It is very important to response to glucocorticoid in the prognosis of these patients. Therefore, resistance to treatment is a major problem in lymphoid leukemia cases. In, this study, CCRF-CEM cell line was selected as a chemotherapy-resistant model. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of high dose prednisolone on induction of apoptosis and changes in BAX and BCL-2 gene expression at different times. Methods: CCRF-CEM cell lines were grown in standard conditions. Based on previous studies, a dose of 700 muM as subtoxic dose was selected. Changes in gene expression of BAX and BCL-2 were evaluated by using real time PCR techniques. Also stained with annexin V and the induction of apoptosis was assessed by FACS machine. Results: In this study it was found that prednisolone in high doses at different times significantly increased the gene expression of BAX and on the other hand the amount of BCL-2 expression was reduced. Cells that treated for 48 hours had more significant changes in gene expression. Based on flowcytometry data, prednisolone can induce apoptosis in a time dependent manner on this cancerous resistant cell line. Conclusions: Apoptosis induced by high-dose prednisolone in the CCRF-CEM cells, which is almost resistant, and possibly mediated by reducing the expression of BCL-2 and BAX up-regulation.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Ghasemi, Amin', 'Khanzadeh, Taghi', 'Zadi Heydarabad, Milad', 'Khorrami, Arash', 'Jahanban Esfahlan, Akram', 'Ghavipanjeh, Somayeh', 'Gholipour Belverdi, Mahdi', 'Darvishani Fikouhi, Saghar', 'Darbin, Akbar', 'Najafpour, Malihe', 'Azimi, Ako']","['Ghasemi A', 'Khanzadeh T', 'Zadi Heydarabad M', 'Khorrami A', 'Jahanban Esfahlan A', 'Ghavipanjeh S', 'Gholipour Belverdi M', 'Darvishani Fikouhi S', 'Darbin A', 'Najafpour M', 'Azimi A']",,"['Student Research Committee, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.

Since longitudinal data on this topic remains scarce, we analyzed reasons for ICU admission as well as short- and long-term outcome of critically ill HSCT recipients. METHODS: A total of 942 consecutive adult patients were transplanted at Hannover Medical School from 2000 to 2013. Of those, 330 patients were at least admitted once to the ICU and included in this retrospective study. To analyze time-dependent improvements, we separately compared patient characteristics as well as reasons and outcome of ICU admission for the periods 2000-2006 and 2007-2013. RESULTS: The main reasons for ICU admission were acute respiratory failure (ARF) in 35%, severe sepsis/septic shock in 23%, and cardiac problems in 18%. ICU admission was clearly associated with shortened survival (p < 0.001), but survival of ICU patients after hospital discharge reached 44% up to 5 years and was comparable to that of non-ICU HSCT patients. When ICU admission periods were compared, patients were older (48 vs. 52 years; p < 0.005) and the percentage of ARF as leading cause for ICU admission decreased from 43% in the first to 30% in the second period. Over time ICU and hospital survival improved from 44 to 60% (p < 0.01) and from 26 to 43% (p < 0.01), respectively. The 1- and 3-year survival rate after ICU admission increased significantly from 14 to 32% and from 11 to 23% (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Besides ARF and septic shock, cardiac events were especially a major reason for ICU admission.

The hexokinase (1-4) family of enzymes catalyze the first step of glycolysis. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) is one of the most highly upregulated metabolic enzymes in both cancer and activated T cells. HK2 is required for the development and/or growth of cancer in several cancer models, but the necessity of HK2 in T cells is not fully understood. The clinical applicability of HK2 inhibition in cancer may be significantly limited by any potential negative effects of HK2 inhibition on T cells. Therefore, we investigated the necessity of HK2 for T cell function. In order to identify additional therapeutic cancer targets, we performed RNA-seq to compare in vivo proliferating T cells to T cell leukemia. Methods: HK2 was genetically ablated in mouse T cells using a floxed Hk2 allele crossed to CD4-Cre. CD4+ and CD8+ cells from mice were characterized metabolically and tested in vitro. T cell function in vivo was tested in a mouse model of colitis, Th2-mediated lung inflammation, and viral infection. Treg function was tested by crossing Hk2-floxed mice to FoxP3-Cre mice. Hematopoietic function was tested by deleting HK2 from bone marrow with Vav1-iCre. RNA-seq was used to compare T cells proliferating in response to virus with primary T-ALL leukemia induced with mutant Notch1 expression. Results: We unexpectedly report that HK2 is largely dispensable for in vitro T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. Loss of HK2 does not impair in vivo viral immunity and causes only a small impairment in the development of pathological inflammation. HK2 is not required for Treg function or hematopoiesis in vivo. One hundred sixty-seven metabolic genes were identified as being differentially expressed between T cells and leukemia. Conclusions: HK2 is a highly upregulated enzyme in cancer and in T cells. The requirement for HK2 in various cancer models has been described previously. Our finding that T cells are able to withstand the loss of HK2 indicates that HK2 may be a promising candidate for cancer therapy. Furthermore, we identify several other potential metabolic targets in T-ALL leukemia that could spare T cell function.",,"['Mehta, Manan M', 'Weinberg, Samuel E', 'Steinert, Elizabeth M', 'Chhiba, Krishan', 'Martinez, Carlos Alberto', 'Gao, Peng', 'Perlman, Harris R', 'Bryce, Paul', 'Hay, Nissim', 'Chandel, Navdeep S']","['Mehta MM', 'Weinberg SE', 'Steinert EM', 'Chhiba K', 'Martinez CA', 'Gao P', 'Perlman HR', 'Bryce P', 'Hay N', 'Chandel NS']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7208-3886'],"['1Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, McGaw Pavilion, Rm.

Pseudohyperkalemia is believed to be an in vitro phenomenon that does not reflect in vivo serum potassium and therefore should not be treated. Here, we present a case who unfortunately underwent unnecessary treatment because of failure to detect the common lab abnormality of pseudohyperkalemia. Case Presentation: A 91-year-old female with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented to the emergency with nausea and vomiting 24 hours after her first chemotherapy with chlorambucil. Physical examination was overall unremarkable. She had a leukocytosis of 210 x 10(3)/microL with 96% lymphocytes along with chronic anemia with hemoglobin of 8.1 g/dL. Her initial sodium and potassium levels were normal. During the clinical course, her potassium progressively worsened and failed to improve despite standard medical treatment. Patient ultimately underwent dialysis. Conclusions: Differentiating true hyperkalemia from pseudohyperkalemia is very important in selected group of patients to avoid unnecessary medications, higher level of care, and unnecessary procedure including dialysis.

AraC is a nucleoside analog that differs from 2'-deoxycytidine only by the presence of an additional hydroxyl group at the C2' position of the 2'-deoxyribose. The active form of the drug AraC 5'-triphosphate (AraCTP) is utilized by human replicative DNA polymerases to insert AraC at the 3' terminus of a growing DNA chain. This impedes further primer extension and is a primary basis for the drug action. The Y-family translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerase eta (Poleta) counteracts this barrier to DNA replication by efficient extension from AraC-terminated primers. Here, we provide high-resolution structures of human Poleta with AraC incorporated at the 3'-primer terminus. We show that Poleta can accommodate AraC at different stages of the catalytic cycle, and that it can manipulate the conformation of the AraC sugar via specific hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions.

However, studies of how these patients understand the risks and benefits of such treatments are lacking. METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal study of older patients newly diagnosed with AML assessing patients' (n = 100) and oncologists' (n = 11) perceptions of treatment-related mortality at enrollment and prognosis at 1 month. We examined concordance between patients' and oncologists' perceptions using Cohen's kappa (kappa < 0.10 indicates little/no concordance). RESULTS: We enrolled patients within 72 hours of initiating intensive (n = 50) or nonintensive (n = 50) chemotherapy. Whereas 91% of patients reported that they were ""somewhat"" to ""extremely likely"" to die from treatment, oncologists estimated that only 12% were at high risk of dying because of treatment (kappa = -0.09). Ninety percent of patients reported that they were ""somewhat"" or ""very likely"" to be cured of their AML, whereas oncologists estimated this chance of cure for only 31% of patients (kappa = 0.05). Among patients receiving intensive chemotherapy, 98% reported that they were ""somewhat"" or ""very likely"" to be cured, whereas their oncologists estimated this likelihood of cure for only 49% (kappa = 0.04); among those receiving nonintensive chemotherapy and their clinicians, these proportions were 82% and 13%, respectively (kappa = 0.03). Patients who indicated a lower likelihood of cure reported significantly higher depression symptoms (p = .03). CONCLUSION: Older patients with AML overestimate the risks and benefits of treatment. Interventions to facilitate communication and enhance patients' understanding of the goals of therapy and treatment risk are needed. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Older patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are confronted with challenging decisions regarding treatment with ""intensive"" chemotherapy that carries significant toxicity for a small chance of a cure versus ""nonintensive"" chemotherapy to control the disease, but with fewer side effects.

Recently, a highly specific MCL-1 inhibitor, S63845, showing sixfold higher affinity to human compared with mouse MCL-1, has been described. To accurately test efficacy and tolerability of this BH3-mimetic (BH3-only protein mimetic) drug in preclinical cancer models, we developed a humanized Mcl-1 (huMcl-1) mouse strain in which MCL-1 was replaced with its human homolog. huMcl-1 mice are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type mice but are more sensitive to the MCL-1 inhibitor S63845. Importantly, nontransformed cells and lymphomas from huMcl-1;Emicro-Myc mice are more sensitive to S63845 in vitro than their control counterparts. When huMcl-1;Emicro-Myc lymphoma cells were transplanted into huMcl-1 mice, treatment with S63845 alone or alongside cyclophosphamide led to long-term remission in approximately 60% or almost 100% of mice, respectively.

This article reviews the incidence and survival of adrenal gland tumors as second primary tumors, according to data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. METHOD: The SEER 13 Registries Database from 1992 to 2013 was used. All primary cancer sites were selected using the Multiple Primary Standardized Incidence Ratios (MP-SIR) session. RESULTS: Data for a total of 2,887,468 persons with cancer were reviewed. 117 of whom had suffered second primary adrenal tumors. The overall standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of adrenal gland tumor as a second primary was 1.49. A high incidence ratio of the event was also detected in specific primary tumor sites: hypopharynx (Observed/Expected(O/E) = 44.59); other endocrine tissue (including the thymus) (O/E=38.27); chronic myeloid leukemia (O/E=11.15); small intestine (O/E=8.86); liver (O/E=8.74); stomach (O/E=4.95); nodal NHL (O/E=3.79); kidney and renal pelvis (O/E=3.19); and breast (O/E=1.78). CONCLUSION: The underlying shared mechanisms should be investigated between adrenal tumors and hypopharyngeal, endocrine and other tumors. Racial disparity is an important challenge in cancer treatment at US and should be taken into consideration in the design of cancer prevention programs. This could be achieved through follow-up programs at specialized national cancer networks, especially for rare tumors like adrenal gland.",,"['Rashed, Wafaa M', 'Saad, Anas M', 'Al-Husseini, Muneer J', 'Galal, Ahmed Mahmoud', 'Ismael, Assem Mohamed', 'Al-Tayep, Ahmed M', 'El Shafie, Ayman', 'Ali, Mahmoud Ahmed', 'Alfaar, Ahmed Samir']","['Rashed WM', 'Saad AM', 'Al-Husseini MJ', 'Galal AM', 'Ismael AM', 'Al-Tayep AM', 'El Shafie A', 'Ali MA', 'Alfaar AS']",,"[""W Rashed, Research department, Children's Cancer Hospital Egypt, Cairo, Egypt."", 'A Saad, Damascus University Faculty of Medicine, Damascus, Syrian Arab Republic.', 'M Al-Husseini, Oncology Department, Ain Shams University Faculty of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'A Galal , Research department, Armed Forces College of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'A Ismael, Research department, Armed Forces College of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'A Al-Tayep , Research department, Armed Forces College of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'A El Shafie , Physical Medicine department, Armed Forces College of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'M Ali , Microbiology and Immunology department, Armed Forces College of Medicine, Cairo, Egypt.', 'A Alfaar, Ophthalmology Department, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin Institut fur Medizin- Pflegepadagogik und Pflegewissenschaft, Berlin, Germany ahmadsfar@gmail.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180823,England,Endocr Connect,Endocrine connections,101598413,,,,PMC6198183,,,,2018/08/25 06:00,2018/08/25 06:00,['2018/08/25 06:00'],"['2018/01/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['EC-18-0304 [pii]', '10.1530/EC-18-0304 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Endocr Connect. 2018 Aug 23. pii: EC-18-0304. doi: 10.1530/EC-18-0304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their incidence is increasing with global population aging. Although many genetic, epigenetic, splicing, and metabolic aberrations have been identified in patients with MDS, their clinical features are quite similar. Here, we show that hypoxia-independent activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1A) signaling is both necessary and sufficient to induce dysplastic and cytopenic MDS phenotypes. The HIF1A transcriptional signature is generally activated in MDS patient bone marrow stem/progenitors. Major MDS-associated mutations (Dnmt3a, Tet2, Asxl1, Runx1, and Mll1) activate the HIF1A signature. Although inducible activation of HIF1A signaling in hematopoietic cells is sufficient to induce MDS phenotypes, both genetic and chemical inhibition of HIF1A signaling rescues MDS phenotypes in a mouse model of MDS. These findings reveal HIF1A as a central pathobiologic mediator of MDS and as an effective therapeutic target for a broad spectrum of patients with MDS.Significance: We showed that dysregulation of HIF1A signaling could generate the clinically relevant diversity of MDS phenotypes by functioning as a signaling funnel for MDS driver mutations. This could resolve the disconnection between genotypes and phenotypes and provide a new clue as to how a variety of driver mutations cause common MDS phenotypes. Cancer Discov; 8(11); 1438-57.

This study was conducted in a prospective observational study design and collected data of patients with a diagnosis of any cancer, at a tertiary care oncology hospital in Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India, during a 2-year period. The PICC was inserted in 352 patients and most commonly used in hematological conditions (n = 295, 83.8%), followed by solid malignancies 57 (16.2%). In the hematological malignancy group, acute myeloid leukemia (48.01%) was the most common indication, and in the solid malignancies group, osteosarcoma (n = 9, 2.55%) was the most common indication for PICC insertion. PICCs were inserted most commonly in the left side of the venous system in 70.7% cases. The complications in the PICC study group included infections (12.5%), thrombosis (4.82%), catheter blockage (4.82%), arrhythmias (4%), premature catheter removal (3%), bleeding (2.55%), and pneumothorax (2.55%). The median days of the PICC use in situ were 152 days. To conclude from our study, PICCs are most commonly indicated in malignancies that are requiring long-term chemotherapy, such as hematological malignancy, especially acute myeloid leukemia, and solid malignancies, usually osteosarcoma, and these catheters are associated with complications such as infection, thrombosis, catheter blockage, arrhythmia, bleeding, and pneumothorax. The most disturbing aspect of the treatment of a cancer patient is multiple painful venipunctures made for administration of cytotoxic agents, antibiotics, blood products, and nutritional supplements. From this study, we can infer that PICC lines can be used for various malignancies that require long-term chemotherapy.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Society for Vascular Nursing. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, its use has been limited by a high rate of hypersensitivity in the long-term used. Hence, there is a continuing need to search for other L-asparaginase sources capable of producing an enzyme with less adverse effects. METHODS: Production of extracellular L-asparaginase by Streptomyces brollosae NEAE-115 was carried out using submerged fermentation. L-asparaginase was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation and pure enzyme was reached using ion-exchange chromatography, followed by enzyme characterization. Anticancer activity towards Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells was investigated in female Swiss albino mice by determination of tumor size and the degree of tumor growth inhibition. The levels of anti-L-asparaginase IgG antibodies in mice sera were measured using ELISA method. RESULTS: The purified L-asparaginase showed a total activity of 795.152 with specific activity of 76.671 U/mg protein and 7.835 - purification fold. The enzyme purity was confirmed by using SDS-PAGE separation which revealed only one distinctive band with a molecular weight of 67 KDa. The enzyme showed maximum activity at pH 8.5, optimum temperature of 37 degrees C, incubation time of 50 min and optimum substrate concentration of 7 mM. A Michaelis-Menten constant analysis showed a Km value of 2.139 x 10(- 3) M with L-asparagine as substrate and Vmax of 152.6 UmL(- 1) min(- 1). The half-life time (T1/2) was 65.02 min at 50 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic, while being 62.65 min at 60 degrees capital ES, Cyrillic. Furthermore, mice treated with Streptomyces brollosae NEAE-115 L-asparaginase showed higher cytotoxic effect (79% tumor growth inhibition) when compared to commercial L-asparaginase group (67% tumor growth inhibition).

Methods: The clinical data of 473 patients with NMOSD admitted into the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and the Department of Neurology, Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University from June 2012 to March 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Eleven NMOSD patients complicated with malignant tumors were screened out (3 with breast cancer, 2 with cervical cancer, 2 with rectal cancer, 2 with leukemia, 1 with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, 1 with thyroid cancer). Fifty patients without NMOSD were included as controls. Results: Most of the NMOSD patients were complicated by low-moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma/adenocarcinoma, mainly seen in breast, reproductive system, digestive system and hematological system. In terms of sex ratio and autoantibodies, the NMOSD patients with and without malignant tumors showed no significant difference. However, comparing to the patients without malignant tumor, the ones with malignant tumor showed a tendency of lower rate of initial brain symptoms and relapse rate, while with older onset age, higher initial EDSS score, protein content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), higher rates of initial symptom resulted from the focus of posterior region of the medulla and of significant image focus. Of the 8 NMOSD patients who diagnosed as malignant tumors in our hospital, 2 with breast cancer and 1 with cervical cancer had a good prognosis (follow-up EDSS score <3). All the 3 patients received aggressive surgery and chemotherapy treatment. However, the other 5 patients had poor prognosis (follow-up EDSS score >/=3 points). All the 11 patients received anti-tumor therapy, 4 patients had first NMOSD attack after anti-tumor treatment and no relapse. Only one case from the remaining 7 patients had relapse; Among the 9 patients received immunosuppressive therapy, 7 patients had no relapse, and 8 cases maintained stable; while, among all the 9 patients received immunosuppressive agents and anti-tumor therapy, only one case had relapse. Conclusions: There are some differences in the clinical features between the NMOSD patients with malignant tumors and the NMOSD patients without malignant tumors. Immunosuppressive therapy can improve the prognosis of patients with NMOSD and tumor, without increasing the risk of malignant tumor. The pathological type, staging and antitumor therapy may influence the prognosis of NMOSD.

The aim of this study was to explore the effect of imperatorin, a linear furanocoumarin compound, on gammadelta T cell-mediated cytotoxicity against CD133+ lung cancer cells. METHODS: CD133+ and CD133- subgroups from A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells were sorted by using flow cytometry. The cytotoxicity of gammadelta T cells against cancer cells was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. The concentration of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand in the co-culture system was determined by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential, expression of death receptor 4 (DR4) and DR5 on the cell surface, and rate of apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. Cytochrome c release and cellular protein expression were detected by western blot analysis. RESULTS: Compared with CD133- cells, CD133+ cells were resistant to gammadelta T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. However, imperatorin significantly increased the sensitivity of CD133+ lung cancer cells to gammadelta T cell treatment in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, we found that myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL-1), an important anti-apoptotic protein belonging to the Bcl-2 family, was overexpressed in CD133+ A549 and PC9 cells compared to their corresponding CD133- cells. Co-treatment with imperatorin and gammadelta T cells suppressed the expression of MCL-1, and thus promoted the mitochondrial apoptosis mediated by gammadelta T cells in CD133+ A549 and PC9 lung cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Up-regulated MCL-1 in CD133+ lung cancer cells is responsible for their resistance to gammadelta T cells. Furthermore, the combination of gammadelta T cells with imperatorin sensitized CD133+ lung cancer cells to gammadelta T cell-mediated cytotoxicity by targeting MCL-1.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Capable of affecting the initiation, promotion, and progression of carcinogenesis through multiple mechanisms, curcumin has potential utility for both chemoprevention and chemotherapy. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin can inhibit ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity in human leukemia and breast cancer cells, and pretreatment with dietary curcumin blocks carcinogen-induced ODC activity in rodent models of skin, colon, and renal cancer. The current study investigated the regulation of polyamine metabolism in human gastric and colon carcinoma cell lines in response to curcumin. Curcumin treatment significantly induced spermine oxidase (SMOX) mRNA and activity, which results in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, a source of ROS. Simultaneously, curcumin down regulated spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) activity and the biosynthetic enzymes ODC and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC), thereby diminishing intracellular polyamine pools. Combination treatments using curcumin with the ODC inhibitor 2-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), an agent currently in clinical chemoprevention trials, significantly enhanced inhibition of ODC activity and decreased growth of GI cancer cell lines beyond that observed with either agent alone. Similarly, combining curcumin with the polyamine analogue bis(ethyl)norspermine enhanced growth inhibition that was accompanied by enhanced accumulation of the analogue and decreased intracellular polyamine levels beyond those observed with either agent alone. Importantly, cotreatment with curcumin permitted the lowering of the effective dose of ODC inhibitor or polyamine analogue. These studies provide insight into the polyamine-related mechanisms involved in the cancer cell response to curcumin and its potential as a chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agent in the GI tract.",,"['Murray-Stewart, Tracy', 'Dunworth, Matthew', 'Lui, Yuan', 'Giardiello, Francis M', 'Woster, Patrick M', 'Casero, Robert A Jr']","['Murray-Stewart T', 'Dunworth M', 'Lui Y', 'Giardiello FM', 'Woster PM', 'Casero RA Jr']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8679-6414'],"['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC, United States of America.', 'Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180823,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)', '121749-39-1 (N(1),N(11)-diethylnorspermine)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.3.- (polyamine oxidase)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.57 (diamine N-acetyltransferase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'EC 4.1.1.50 (Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'ZQN1G5V6SR (Eflornithine)']",IM,"['Acetyltransferases/metabolism', 'Adenosylmethionine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biosynthetic Pathways/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Eflornithine/pharmacology', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/genetics', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Spermine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",PMC6107220,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2018/08/24 06:00,2019/02/09 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0202677 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-04877 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Aug 23;13(8):e0202677. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0202677. eCollection 2018.,8,e0202677,['R01 CA204345/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two different approaches to MTX intensification exist but had not been compared in T-cell ALL (T-ALL): the Children's Oncology Group (COG) escalating dose intravenous MTX without leucovorin rescue plus pegaspargase escalating dose, Capizzi-style, intravenous MTX (C-MTX) regimen and the Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster (BFM) high-dose intravenous MTX (HDMTX) plus leucovorin rescue regimen. PATIENTS AND METHODS: COG AALL0434 included a 2 x 2 randomization that compared the COG-augmented BFM (ABFM) regimen with either C-MTX or HDMTX during the 8-week interim maintenance phase. All patients with T-ALL, except for those with low-risk features, received prophylactic (12 Gy) or therapeutic (18 Gy for CNS3) cranial irradiation during either the consolidation (C-MTX; second month of therapy) or delayed intensification (HDMTX; seventh month of therapy) phase. RESULTS: AALL0434 accrued 1,895 patients from 2007 to 2014. The 5-year event-free survival and overall survival rates for all eligible, evaluable patients with T-ALL were 83.8% (95% CI, 81.2% to 86.4%) and 89.5% (95% CI, 87.4% to 91.7%), respectively. The 1,031 patients with T-ALL but without CNS3 disease or testicular leukemia were randomly assigned to receive ABFM with C-MTX (n = 519) or HDMTX (n = 512). The estimated 5-year disease-free survival ( P = .005) and overall survival ( P = .04) rates were 91.5% (95% CI, 88.1% to 94.8%) and 93.7% (95% CI, 90.8% to 96.6%) for C-MTX and 85.3% (95% CI, 81.0%-89.5%) and 89.4% (95% CI, 85.7%-93.2%) for HDMTX. Patients assigned to C-MTX had 32 relapses, six with CNS involvement, whereas those assigned to HDMTX had 59 relapses, 23 with CNS involvement. CONCLUSION: AALL0434 established that ABFM with C-MTX was superior to ABFM plus HDMTX for T-ALL in approximately 90% of patients who received CRT, with later timing for those receiving HDMTX.",,"['Winter, Stuart S', 'Dunsmore, Kimberly P', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Esiashvili, Natia', 'Chen, Zhiguo', 'Eisenberg, Nancy', 'Briegel, Nikki', 'Hayashi, Robert J', 'Gastier-Foster, Julie M', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Asselin, Barbara L', 'Gaynon, Paul S', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Rabin, Karen R', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Zweidler-Mckay, Patrick A', 'Winick, Naomi J', 'Carroll, William L', 'Hunger, Stephen P']","['Winter SS', 'Dunsmore KP', 'Devidas M', 'Wood BL', 'Esiashvili N', 'Chen Z', 'Eisenberg N', 'Briegel N', 'Hayashi RJ', 'Gastier-Foster JM', 'Carroll AJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Asselin BL', 'Gaynon PS', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Loh ML', 'Rabin KR', 'Raetz EA', 'Zweidler-Mckay PA', 'Winick NJ', 'Carroll WL', 'Hunger SP']",,"[""Stuart S.

China: a retrospective case-control study.",10.1080/19932820.2018.1508273 [doi],"OBJECTIVES: Our research investigated the relationship between childhood leukemia and breastfeeding in the P. R. of China. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case-control study from March 2008 to April 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, Zhejiang province, P. R. of China, which reviewed 958 children who had been diagnosed with leukemia in case group and 785 healthy children in control group. Data were obtained from medical records, and if the medical records were incomplete, we called mothers of children by phone to complete the data. RESULTS: Breastfeeding reduces the risk of childhood leukemia; the effect is greater, if feeding continued for 7-9 months (p = 0.002). In addition, we suggest that some factors such as maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, abortion history, genetic factors, parents use of hair dye, and the history of using birth control pills before pregnancy can increase the risk of childhood leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that promoting breastfeeding for 7-9 months may help lower the childhood leukemia incidence. Our study firstly demonstrates that breastfeeding has protective effects against childhood leukemia in the P. R. of China.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target the ATP-binding site have transformed CML into a chronic manageable disease. However, some patients develop drug resistance due to ATP-site mutations impeding drug binding. We describe the discovery of asciminib (ABL001), the first allosteric BCR-ABL1 inhibitor to reach the clinic. Asciminib binds to the myristate pocket of BCR-ABL1 and maintains activity against TKI-resistant ATP-site mutations. Although resistance can emerge due to myristate-site mutations, these are sensitive to ATP-competitive inhibitors so that combinations of asciminib with ATP-competitive TKIs suppress the emergence of resistance. Fragment-based screening using NMR and X-ray yielded ligands for the myristate pocket. An NMR-based conformational assay guided the transformation of these inactive ligands into ABL1 inhibitors. Further structure-based optimization for potency, physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and drug-like properties, culminated in asciminib, which is currently undergoing clinical studies in CML patients.",,"['Schoepfer, Joseph', 'Jahnke, Wolfgang', 'Berellini, Giuliano', 'Buonamici, Silvia', 'Cotesta, Simona', 'Cowan-Jacob, Sandra W', 'Dodd, Stephanie', 'Drueckes, Peter', 'Fabbro, Doriano', 'Gabriel, Tobias', 'Groell, Jean-Marc', 'Grotzfeld, Robert M', 'Hassan, A Quamrul', 'Henry, Chrystele', 'Iyer, Varsha', 'Jones, Darryl', 'Lombardo, Franco', 'Loo, Alice', 'Manley, Paul W', 'Pelle, Xavier', 'Rummel, Gabriele', 'Salem, Bahaa', 'Warmuth, Markus', 'Wylie, Andrew A', 'Zoller, Thomas', 'Marzinzik, Andreas L', 'Furet, Pascal']","['Schoepfer J', 'Jahnke W', 'Berellini G', 'Buonamici S', 'Cotesta S', 'Cowan-Jacob SW', 'Dodd S', 'Drueckes P', 'Fabbro D', 'Gabriel T', 'Groell JM', 'Grotzfeld RM', 'Hassan AQ', 'Henry C', 'Iyer V', 'Jones D', 'Lombardo F', 'Loo A', 'Manley PW', 'Pelle X', 'Rummel G', 'Salem B', 'Warmuth M', 'Wylie AA', 'Zoller T', 'Marzinzik AL', 'Furet P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7003-3305', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0829-0412']","['Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research , 250 Massachusetts Avenue , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research , 250 Massachusetts Avenue , Cambridge , Massachusetts 02139 , United States.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.', 'Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Novartis Campus , CH-4056 Basel , Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180907,United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (asciminib)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Allosteric Regulation', 'Animals', 'Dogs', '*Drug Discovery', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Niacinamide/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,2018/08/24 06:00,2019/10/15 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01040 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2018 Sep 27;61(18):8120-8135. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01040.

Infectious parasitic diseases were listed among factors that predispose to cancer. Because of the resemblance between the life cycle of cancer cells and some parasites, this study aimed to prepare pyran derivatives with cytotoxic and antiprotozoal potencies. Therefore, 7 chromenes, 10 pyranocoumarins, and an unexpected intermediate were obtained from a multi-reagent one-pot reaction. These compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity on sensitive and resistant leukemia cancer cells lines and against two protozoan parasites, namely Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania amazonensis amastigote. Promising cytotoxicity (IC50 values of less than 1 microM) was obtained for two of the synthetic products (12 and 15). Compound 12 induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells in G0/G1 while compound 15 and doxorubicin induced apoptosis and arrest in the S and G2/M phases.

This article presents a case report of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a patient who was involved in the 1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and suffered an acute radiation syndrome of degree II severity. Based on clinical and cytogenetic dosimetry, the average absorbed radiation dose to the whole body was estimated to be 4.3 Gy. During long-term clinical follow-up (27 years), moderate transient instability of hematological parameters was observed: lymphocytosis, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, which was associated with chronic viral hepatitis C. Further cytogenetic investigations demonstrated a very high frequency of translocations, up to 50 times background values, that persisted over 3 decades. In 2014, the patient was diagnosed and operated on for prostate cancer and received a course of radiotherapy (total fractionated local dose of 35 Gy) in May 2015. From December 2015 through April 2016, the patient experienced general weakness and developed progressive cytopenia. A diagnosis of AML, resulting from a myelodysplastic syndrome, was confirmed by abnormal complex clones detected in 38% of metaphases by the mFISH-method, along with other chromosomal rearrangements.

Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a precursor clonal state that confers increased risk of leukemia and occurs at an elevated rate in patients with thyroid cancer relative to other solid tumors. Objective: We explore if the high prevalence of CH may be a result of RAI exposure and whether CH may be a surrogate in the association between RAI and leukemia. Design: CH, CH-potential driver (CH-PD), and overall survival were evaluated in 279 patients with advanced thyroid carcinoma. Results: The prevalence of CH in patients with thyroid cancer was 37%, and that of CH-PD was 5.2%. Age was the strongest predictor of CH and CH-PD. For every year increase in age, there was a 5% and 13% increase in the odds of CH and CH-PD, respectively. RAI dose was significantly associated with CH and CH-PD, even after adjustment for age, external beam radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. For every 10 mCi increase in the dose of RAI administered, there was a 2% and 4% increase in the odds of CH and CH-PD, respectively. Patients with CH-PD previously exposed to RAI had a significantly poorer survival, even when stratified by age (heart rate = 3.75, 95% CI = 1.23 to 11.5, P = 0.02). Conclusions: RAI was associated with a high prevalence of CH, and CH is a precursor state of hematologic malignancies. The implications of this study may favor identification of CH in patients where the risks might outweigh the benefits of receiving RAI therapy for thyroid cancer.",,"['Boucai, Laura', 'Falcone, John', 'Ukena, Jenny', 'Coombs, Catherine C', 'Zehir, Ahmet', 'Ptashkin, Ryan', 'Berger, Michael F', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Fagin, James A']","['Boucai L', 'Falcone J', 'Ukena J', 'Coombs CC', 'Zehir A', 'Ptashkin R', 'Berger MF', 'Levine RL', 'Fagin JA']",,"['Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Division of Endocrinology, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",,United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/radiation effects', 'Carcinoma/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoiesis/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/radiation effects', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/genetics/pathology/prevention & control', 'Precancerous Conditions/*epidemiology/etiology/pathology', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/mortality/*radiotherapy']",PMC6194804,,,,2018/08/24 06:00,2019/09/11 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['5075165 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2018-00803 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2018 Nov 1;103(11):4216-4223. doi: 10.1210/jc.2018-00803.,11,4216-4223,"['K12 CA120780/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA172012/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01775072'],,,,,,,,,

However, the function of P2 receptors in viral infection has been little explored. Here we demonstrated that P2Y13 and its ligand ADP play an important role in protecting hosts from viral infections. First, we demonstrate that P2Y13, as a typical interferon-stimulated gene, is induced together with extracellular ADP during viral infection. Most importantly, extracellular ADP restricts the replication of different kinds of viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus, Newcastle disease virus, herpes simplex virus 1, and murine leukemia virus. This kind of protection is dependent on P2Y13 but not P2Y1 or P2Y12, which are also considered as receptors for ADP. Furthermore, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and EPAC1 are downregulated by extracellular ADP through the P2Y13-coupled Gi alpha subunit. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of EPAC1 significantly eliminates ADP/P2Y13-mediated antiviral activities. Taken together, our results show that P2Y13 and ADP play pivotal roles in the clearance of invaded virus and have the potential as antiviral targets.","['(c) The Author(s) (2018).

The current study assessed how the general public in the United Kingdom (UK) values AML health states. METHODS: The composite time trade-off (cTTO) methodology was employed to elicit health state utilities in AML. Pertinent AML literature related to symptom and quality-of-life impact including physical, functional and emotional well-being, as well as the safety profile of AML treatments, were taken into consideration for drafting health state descriptions. Ten health states included in the study were newly diagnosed AML, induction, consolidation, maintenance, long-term follow-up, relapsed/refractory, stem-cell transplant (SCT) procedure, SCT recovery, SCT long-term follow-up with complications and SCT long-term follow-up without complications. The descriptions were validated by haematologists and nurse specialists for clinical accuracy and completeness. A total of 210 individuals from the general UK population participated in the cTTO interviews. Descriptive statistics were computed for health state utility values. RESULTS: The mean age of the participants was 44.0 years (standard deviation [SD] 14.9, range 18-81) and comprised 129 (61.4%) female participants. The utility values ranged from 0.94 (SD 0.13) for SCT long-term follow-up without complications to - 0.21 (SD 0.62) for the SCT procedure.

However, this drug has numerous side effects, which include impaired healing and regeneration after injuries or tissue damages. It suggests negative effects of morphine on stem cells which are responsible for tissue regeneration. Therefore, we studied the impact of morphine on the properties and functional characteristics of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The presence of mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors (OR) in untreated MSCs, and the enhanced expression of OR in MSCs pretreated with proinflammatory cytokines, was demonstrated using immunoblotting and by flow cytometry. Morphine modified in a dose-dependent manner the MSC phenotype, inhibited MSC proliferation and altered the ability of MSCs to differentiate into adipocytes or osteoblasts. Furthermore, morphine rather enhanced the expression of genes for various immunoregulatory molecules in activated MSCs, but significantly inhibited the production of the vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor or leukemia inhibitory factor. All of these observations are underlying the selective impact of morphine on stem cells, and offer an explanation for the mechanisms of the negative effects of opioid drugs on stem cells and regenerative processes after morphine administration or in opioid addicts.",,"['Holan, Vladimir', 'Cechova, Kristina', 'Zajicova, Alena', 'Kossl, Jan', 'Hermankova, Barbora', 'Bohacova, Pavla', 'Hajkova, Michaela', 'Krulova, Magdalena', 'Svoboda, Petr', 'Javorkova, Eliska']","['Holan V', 'Cechova K', 'Zajicova A', 'Kossl J', 'Hermankova B', 'Bohacova P', 'Hajkova M', 'Krulova M', 'Svoboda P', 'Javorkova E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2011-3390'],"['Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic. holan@biomed.cas.cz.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic. holan@biomed.cas.cz.', 'Department of Biomathematics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Biomathematics, Institute of Physiology of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Transplantation Immunology, Institute of Experimental Medicine of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 4, 142 20, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Science, Charles University, 128 43, Prague 2, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Stem Cell Rev Rep,Stem cell reviews and reports,101752767,"['0 (Receptors, Opioid)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)']",IM,"['Adipocytes/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Morphine/*pharmacology', 'Osteoblasts/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Opioid/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytokines', '*Gene expression', '*Growth factors', '*Mesenchymal stem cells', '*Morphine', '*Opioid receptors']",,2018/08/24 06:00,2019/01/24 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12015-018-9843-8 [doi]', '10.1007/s12015-018-9843-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Stem Cell Rev Rep. 2018 Dec;14(6):801-811. doi: 10.1007/s12015-018-9843-8.,6,801-811,"['17-07070S and 17-05903S/Grant Agency of the Czech Republic/International', 'LO1309 and LO1508/Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An increased risk of cancer in patients with CVID has been documented. This study was undertaken to highlight radiation sensitivity in CVID patients and to clarify the genetic basis of this defect in these cases. Stimulated lymphocytes of the studied subjects were exposed to low-dose gamma-rays in the G2 phase or the G0 phase of the cell cycle and chromosomal aberrations were scored. Lymphocytes of healthy individuals, ataxia telangiectasia (AT) cases and a group of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients were investigated in the same way as controls. By two methods of analysis (one-way ANOVA and unpaired t-test), the CVID cases were significantly more radiosensitive than healthy controls based on the results of the G2 and the G0 assays. First-degree relatives of CVID patients were radiosensitive by the micronucleus assay which showed a significant difference as compared with normal controls (p = 0.001). In conclusion, this study may support that chromosomal radiosensitivity in CVID patients is a marker of genetic predisposition to the disease.

However, how this histone modifier affects in a cell type-dependent manner remains unclear. Here, we show that in contrast to its oncogenic effect in preleukemia state and lymphoid malignancies, JMJD3 relieves the differentiation-arrest of certain subtypes (such as M2 and M3) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. RNA sequencing and ChIP-PCR analyses revealed that JMJD3 exerts anti-AML effect by directly modulating H3K4 and H3K27 methylation levels to activate the expression of a number of key myelopoietic regulatory genes. Mechanistic exploration identified a physical and functional association of JMJD3 with C/EBPbeta that presides the regulatory network of JMJD3. Thus, the leukemia regulatory role of JMJD3 varies in a disease phase- and lineage-dependent manner, and acts as a potential oncorepressor in certain subsets of AML largely by coupling to C/EBPbeta-centered myelopoietic program.",,"['Yu, Shan-He', 'Zhu, Kang-Yong', 'Chen, Juan', 'Liu, Xiang-Zhen', 'Xu, Peng-Fei', 'Zhang, Wu', 'Yan, Li', 'Guo, He-Zhou', 'Zhu, Jiang']","['Yu SH', 'Zhu KY', 'Chen J', 'Liu XZ', 'Xu PF', 'Zhang W', 'Yan L', 'Guo HZ', 'Zhu J']",,"['State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China.', 'School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, Shanghai, 200040, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Medical Genomics, Shanghai Institute of Hematology and Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China. zhujiang@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'School of Life Sciences & Biotechnology, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University, Shanghai, 200040, China. zhujiang@shsmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180822,England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.5.- (Kdm6b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-beta/genetics/*metabolism', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Computational Biology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID']",PMC6105679,,,,2018/08/24 06:00,2018/12/18 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2017/06/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41467-018-05548-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41467-018-05548-z [pii]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2018 Aug 22;9(1):3369. doi: 10.1038/s41467-018-05548-z.,1,3369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Argirein, a new synthetic compound was demonstrated to inactivate NADPH oxidase to alleviate cardiac dysfunction in T2DM. Here, we investigated whether argirein medication attenuated the vascular dysfunction in T2DM by inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis which was associated with NADPH oxidase. The rat aortic endothelial cells (RAECs) were incubated with glucose (30 mM) for 48 hour in vitro. It was shown that high glucose significantly increased the protein expression of BAX (Bcl-2 Associated X protein) and Caspase-3 and decreased Bcl2 (B-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma 2) protein level in RAECs, which was normalized by argirein medication. The annexin V-FITC bound cell percentage and DNA fragments in agarose electrophoresis were markedly suppressed by argirein to confirm the anti-apoptotic property of argirein in RAECs. Furthermore, we found that argirein blocked the endothelin (ET)-1/Nox4 signal-dependent superoxide (O2(-.)) generation, which regulated endothelial cell apoptosis in RAECs. In vivo, argirein intervention relieved the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine and restored the expressions of Nox4 and BAX in the aorta endothelium of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed rats following streptozocin (STZ) injection. For the first time, we demonstrated that argirein could inhibit vascular endothelial cell apoptosis, which was attributed to blocking ET-1/Nox4 signal-dependent O2(-) generation in RAECs. This current study revealed the therapeutic effects of argirein to prevent the vascular complication in T2DM through inhibiting endothelial cell apoptosis which was associated with the anti-oxidative property of argirein.",,"['Su, Jie', 'An, Xing-Rong', 'Li, Qing', 'Li, Xiao-Xue', 'Cong, Xiao-Dong', 'Xu, Ming']","['Su J', 'An XR', 'Li Q', 'Li XX', 'Cong XD', 'Xu M']",,"['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Preclinical Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Preclinical Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Preclinical Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School of Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Hangzhou, 311400, China.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Preclinical Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China. mingxu@cpu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180822,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Endothelin-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (argirein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 4)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (Nox4 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anthraquinones/*pharmacology', 'Aorta', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arginine/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Endothelin-1/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/metabolism', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Male', 'NADPH Oxidase 4/*metabolism', 'NADPH Oxidases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Streptozocin/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6105644,,,,2018/08/24 06:00,2019/11/27 06:00,['2018/08/24 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-30386-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-30386-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 22;8(1):12620. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30386-w.,1,12620,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, APRIL receptor TACI expression is significantly higher in regulatory T cells (Tregs) than conventional T cells (Tcons) from the same patient, confirmed by upregulated Treg markers, i.e., Foxp3, CTLA-4. APRIL significantly stimulates proliferation and survival of Tregs, whereas neutralizing anti-APRIL monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) inhibit these effects. Besides TACI-dependent induction of cell cycle progression and anti-apoptosis genes, APRIL specifically augments Foxp3, IL-10, TGFbeta1, and PD-L1 in Tregs to further enhance Treg-inhibited Tcon proliferation. APRIL further increases MM cell-driven Treg (iTreg) via TACI-dependent proliferation associated with upregulated IL-10, TGFbeta1, and CD15s in iTreg, which further inhibits Tcons. Osteoclasts producing APRIL and PD-L1 significantly block Tcon expansion by iTreg generation, which is overcome by combined treatment with anti-APRIL and anti-PD1/PD-L1 mAbs. Finally, APRIL increases IL-10-producing B regulatory cells (Bregs) via TACI on BM Bregs of MM patients.

While allogeneic stem cell transplantation may provide cure in some patients, many still relapse after transplant and are then left with limited therapeutic options and poor survival. Moreover, the quality of the end-of-life care for these patients has not been previously reported. We describe here the end-of-life experience of a cohort of 72 older patients with AML who relapsed after first allogeneic stem cell transplant at our dedicated cancer center. Despite a median overall survival of only 4 months, we find a high level of primary palliative care delivered by transplant/leukemia physicians through goals of care discussions and/or advanced care planning and provide evidence for high-quality end-of-life care outcomes, often with concurrent disease-directed therapy.

Patients (median age, 58 years) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; n = 1258), who were in first or subsequent remission, or with MDS (n = 951) who had refractory anemia with unilineage or multilineage dysplasia, 5q- syndrome, or refractory anemia with excess blasts received nonirradiation-containing regimens and were transplanted between 2009 and 2014 in the United States. Three-year RFS with high-intensity busulfan/cyclophosphamide (Bu4/Cy; 44%) was comparable to conditioning with high-intensity fludarabine/busulfan (Flu/Bu4; 44%), reduced-intensity fludarabine/melphalan (Flu/Mel; 52%; P = .53), and Flu/Mel + anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG; 44%; P = .38).

RFS with Flu/Mel was superior to RFS with Flu/Bu2 (P = .01) and Flu/Bu2 + ATG (P = .0006). The 3-year incidence of relapse was 22% with Flu/Mel compared with 46% with Flu/Bu2 and 56% with Flu/Bu2 + ATG. With only a modest reduction in nonrelapse mortality with the Flu/Bu2 regimens, the higher relapse incidence resulted in lower RFS.

However, a sensitive and easily implemented NGS methodology for routine clinical laboratories is lacking and clinical utility of NGS-MRD surveillance in a post-remission setting to predict clinical relapse has not been determined. METHODS: Here we described a simple and quantitative NGS platform and assessed its performance characteristics, quantified NGS-MRD levels in 122 B-ALL samples from 30 B-ALL patients, and explored the clinical merit of NGS-based MRD surveillance. RESULTS: The current NGS platform has an analytic sensitivity of 0.0001% with excellent specificity and reproducibility. Overall, it performs better than routine multi-color flow cytometry (MCF) in detecting MRD. Utilizing this assay in MRD surveillance in a post-remission setting showed that it detected conversion to positive MRD (CPMRD) in patients with NGS-based molecular remission much earlier than MCF, and that positive MRD conversion could be detected as early as 25.6 weeks prior to clinical relapse in closely surveilled patients. Post-remission CPMRD, but not NGS-based MRD positivity at end of induction, can accurately predict clinical relapse in our limited cohort of B-ALL patients.

In this study, we assessed whether NRG-1 could protect the heart by mimicking the cardioprotective effects of ischaemic postconditioning (IP). METHODS: We used a myocardial reperfusion injury rat model in vivo to compare the cardioprotective effects of NRG-1(3 mug/kg, iv. at the onset of reperfusion) and IP. In Langendorff isolated heart perfusion experiments, we used the erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homolog 4 (ErbB4) inhibitor AG1478, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal regulated kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 to clarify whether the protective effects of NRG-1and IP depend on the NRG-1/ErbB4 signals and the reperfusion injury salvage kinase (RISK) pathway. Infarct size was detected by Evans blue and TTC. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assays. The expression of NRG-1/ErbB4 and downstream ERK1/2, AKT, AMPK and p70s6K were detected by western blotting. Hematoxylin/eosin (H&E) staining was used for histological analysis. RESULTS: We found that NRG-1 and IP had similar effects on reducing myocardial infarct size and apoptosis in vivo. NRG-1 heart protein levels were upregulated in the IP group. Phosphorylation of AKT, ERK1/2 and ErbB4 were also increased in both the IP and NRG-1 groups. Furthermore, in Langendorff analyses, the ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 suppressed the phosphorylation of ErbB4 and the RISK pathway and aggravated myocardial edema and fiber fracture, thereby inhibited the cardioprotective effects in both the IP and NRG-1 groups. For assessment of downstream signals, the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the MEK inhibitor PD98059 suppressed the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2 respectively and abolished the cardioprotective effects induced by IP and NRG-1. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, both IP and NRG-1 could reduce infarct size and apoptosis through ErbB4-dependent activation of the RISK pathway in the same model; these results indicated the therapeutic potential of NRG-1 as a pharmacological postconditioning agent against myocardial reperfusion injury.",,"['Wang, Fuhua', 'Wang, Huan', 'Liu, Xuejing', 'Yu, Haiyi', 'Zuo, Bo', 'Song, Zhu', 'Wang, Ning', 'Huang, Wei', 'Wang, Guisong']","['Wang F', 'Wang H', 'Liu X', 'Yu H', 'Zuo B', 'Song Z', 'Wang N', 'Huang W', 'Wang G']",,"[""Department of Cardiology, Peking University Third Hospital, Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Molecular Biology and Regulatory Peptides, Ministry of Health, Key Laboratory of Molecular Cardiovascular Sciences, Ministry of Education.

Particularly interesting is the class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including the recently described subclass of circular RNAs (circRNAs), which display tissue- and cell-type specific expression patterns and exert diverse regulatory functions in the cells. B-cells undergo complex and tightly regulated processes in order to develop from antigen naive cells residing in the bone marrow to the highly diverse and competent effector cells circulating in peripheral blood. These processes include V(D)J recombination, rapid proliferation, somatic hypermutation and clonal selection, posing a risk of malignant transformation at each step. The aim of this review is to provide insight into how lncRNAs including circRNAs, participate in normal B-cell differentiation, and how deregulation of these molecules is involved in the development of B-cell malignancies. We describe the prognostic value and functional significance of specific deregulated lncRNAs in diseases such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma, and we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the role of circRNAs in these diseases.",,"['Dahl, Mette', 'Kristensen, Lasse Sommer', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Dahl M', 'Kristensen LS', 'Gronbaek K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5980-7939'],"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. mette.dahl.01@regionh.dk.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, BRIC, Copenhagen University, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark. mette.dahl.01@regionh.dk.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark. lasse@mbg.au.dk.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000 Aarhus, Denmark. lasse@mbg.au.dk.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, DK-2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.

MIM1 is a specific low molecular Mcl-1 protein inhibitor able to induce Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells death. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of MIM1 as well as MIM1 and temozolomide (TMZ) mixture on cell viability, apoptosis and cell cycle progression in human U87MG glioblastoma cells. Cell viability was performed by the WST-1 assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential, Annexin V assay, DNA fragmentation and cell cycle distribution were determined by fluorescence image cytometer NucleoCounter NC-3000. The obtained results show that MIM1 and MIM1/TMZ mixture decrease glioblastoma cells viability in a dose- and time- dependent manner. Moreover, the exposure of U87MG cells to MIM1 and MIM1/TMZ mixture causes mitochondrial dysfunction as well as DNA fragmentation and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase.

This retrospective study, conducted at Shanghai's Children's Medical Center in China (SCMC), aimed to investigate the long-term results of childhood ALL and to identify prognostic factors. The Pediatric Oncology Network Database, designed by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA, were used to collect data for the enrolled patients starting in 2005. From 2005 to 2014, 1085 evaluable patients with ALL aged 1 to 18 years old were enrolled and treated using SCMC-ALL-2005 risk-stratified protocol. Complete remission was achieved in 95.6% of patients. At 5 and 10 years, the event-free survival rate was 68.3 +/- 1.4% and 64.6 +/- 1.6%, and the overall survival rate was 80.0 +/- 1.2% and 76.3 +/- 1.6%, respectively. The 5-year event-free survival rates were 81.8 +/- 2.0%, 67.0 +/- 1.9%, and 14.3 +/- 4.0% for patients in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively. The cumulative risk of relapse was 24.5% at 10 years. Induction failure conferred worse prognosis. Patients younger than 1 year of age at diagnosis, intermediate-risk/high-risk group, male gender, and positive minimal residual disease (MRD) results at day 55, both in the univariate and multivariate analysis, were associated with significantly worse prognosis (P < .05). Patients with positive MRD at both day 35 and day 55 were related to a significantly poor outcome (P < .0001), but not for patients with negitive MRD at day 35. The overall outcomes for ALL patients treated with protocol SCMC-ALL-2005 in SCMC are lower than in developed countries.

Due to limited population data, however, disease surveillance statistics are typically truncated at age 84 years and then grouped into a terminal age category of >/=85 years. We used more detailed older age data from the 2010 census in conjunction with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry records for 2008-2012 diagnoses to estimate 5-year age-specific incidence rates through ages 90-94 years and >/=95 years for major cancers. Overall cancer rates increased to a maximum in the 80-89-year ranges and subsequently declined. Incidence rates peaked in younger age groups for several specific cancers, including breast, cervix uteri, corpus uteri, and prostate. Whereas, rates for colon and rectum, leukemia, melanoma, pancreas, stomach, and urinary bladder continued to rise among men and women into their early 90s. Rates of liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer showed an initial spike among men aged 60-64 years followed by a larger peak at ages 80-84. Since these age-specific incidence patterns were based on cross-sectional data, they may vary over time for some cancers (eg, lung and liver) as the prevalence of major risk factors change across birth cohorts. Future studies using new, publicly available databases with these additional older age groups can examine cancer subtypes defined by our emerging understanding of molecular biomarkers.

We investigate what happens during prolonged prometaphase that leads to daughter cell arrest in the absence of DNA damage. We find that progressive loss of anti-apoptotic MCL-1 activity and oxidative stress act in concert to partially activate the apoptosis pathway, resulting in the delayed death of some daughters and senescence for the rest. At physiological oxygen levels, longer prometaphase durations are needed for all daughters to arrest. Partial activation of apoptosis during prolonged prometaphase leads to persistent caspase activity, which activates the kinase cascade mediating the post-mitotic activation of p38. This in turn activates p53, and the consequent expression of p21stops the cell cycle. This mechanism can prevent cells suffering intractable mitotic defects, which modestly prolong mitosis but allow its completion without DNA damage, from producing future cell generations that are susceptible to the evolution of a transformed phenotype.",,"['Uetake, Yumi', 'Sluder, Greenfield']","['Uetake Y', 'Sluder G']",,"['Department of Radiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655.', 'Department of Radiology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180822,United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cellular Senescence/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', '*Prometaphase/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC6249836,,,,2018/08/23 06:00,2019/05/18 06:00,['2018/08/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.E18-01-0026 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2018 Nov 1;29(22):2632-2643. doi: 10.1091/mbc.E18-01-0026.

Having the potential to trigger apoptosis in various human leukemia cell lines, resveratrol is regarded as a robust agent in chemotherapy regimens. The current study was aimed to assess whether the apoptotic effect of resveratrol on T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, CCRF-CEM, is exerted through DNA methylation of BAX and BCL2 gene promoters. For this purpose, the CCRF-CEM cells were treated by resveratrol under standard cell culture. To analyze the promoter DNA methylation changes, we used methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction technique following the resveratrol treatment at different dosages and time intervals. Based on our previous study, the resveratrol treatment can trigger apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cell line via upregulation of apoptotic BAX gene and downregulation of antiapoptotic BCL2 gene. Despite these alterations in gene expression, the current study reveals no changes in DNA methylation patterns of subjected genes following the resveratrol treatment. Unchanged status of DNA methylation of BAX and BCL2 genes may suggest that resveratrol causes the gene expression changes through a distinct mechanism which requires further studies to be understood.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zadi Heydarabad, Milad', 'Vatanmakanian, Mousa', 'Abdolalizadeh, Jalal', 'Mohammadi, Hamed', 'Azimi, Ako', 'Mousavi Ardehaie, Reza', 'Movasaghpour, Aliakbar', 'Farshdousti Hagh, Majid']","['Zadi Heydarabad M', 'Vatanmakanian M', 'Abdolalizadeh J', 'Mohammadi H', 'Azimi A', 'Mousavi Ardehaie R', 'Movasaghpour A', 'Farshdousti Hagh M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7347-4272', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2340-6594']","['Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Basic Science, Maragheh University of Medical Sciences, Maragheh, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Laboratory, Division of Medical Genetics, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Drug Applied Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180821,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Resveratrol/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/*genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA methylation', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*apoptosis', '*methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction', '*resveratrol']",,2018/08/23 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/08/23 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;119(12):10033-10040. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27333.

We examined outcomes and toxicities of CLL patients who would have been excluded from the pivotal study, specifically <65 and/or those with del[17p13]. This multicenter, retrospective cohort study examined CLL patients treated with front-line ibrutinib at 20 community and academic centers, categorizing them based on key inclusion criteria for the RESONATE-2 trial: <65 vs >/=65 and present vs absent del[17p13]. Of 391 included patients, 57% would have been excluded from the pivotal study. Forty-one percent of our cohort was <65, and 30% had del(17p13). Patients <65 were more likely to start 420 mg of ibrutinib daily; those who started at reduced doses had inferior PFS. The most common adverse events were arthralgias, fatigue, rash, bruising, and diarrhea. Twenty-four percent discontinued ibrutinib at 13.8 months median follow-up; toxicity was the most common reason for discontinuation, though progression and/or transformation accounted for a larger proportion of discontinuations in <65 and those with del(17p13). Response rates were similar for <65 and those with del(17p13). However, patients with del(17p13) had inferior PFS and OS. Ibrutinib in the front-line setting has extended beyond the population in which it was initially studied and approved. This study highlights and compares important differences in ibrutinib dosing, treatment interruptions, toxicities, reasons for discontinuation, and survival outcomes in two important patient populations not studied in RESONATE-2.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mato, Anthony R', 'Roeker, Lindsey E', 'Allan, John N', 'Pagel, John M', 'Brander, Danielle M', 'Hill, Brian T', 'Cheson, Bruce D', 'Furman, Richard R', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Tam, Constantine S', 'Handunnetti, Sasanka', 'Jacobs, Ryan', 'Lansigan, Frederick', 'Bhavsar, Erica', 'Barr, Paul M', 'Shadman, Mazyar', 'Skarbnik, Alan P', 'Goy, Andre', 'Beach, Douglas F', 'Svoboda, Jakub', 'Pu, Jeffrey J', 'Sehgal, Alison R', 'Zent, Clive S', 'Tuncer, Hande H', 'Schuster, Stephen J', 'Pickens, Peter V', 'Shah, Nirav N', 'Rhodes, Joanna', 'Ujjani, Chaitra S', 'Nabhan, Chadi']","['Mato AR', 'Roeker LE', 'Allan JN', 'Pagel JM', 'Brander DM', 'Hill BT', 'Cheson BD', 'Furman RR', 'Lamanna N', 'Tam CS', 'Handunnetti S', 'Jacobs R', 'Lansigan F', 'Bhavsar E', 'Barr PM', 'Shadman M', 'Skarbnik AP', 'Goy A', 'Beach DF', 'Svoboda J', 'Pu JJ', 'Sehgal AR', 'Zent CS', 'Tuncer HH', 'Schuster SJ', 'Pickens PV', 'Shah NN', 'Rhodes J', 'Ujjani CS', 'Nabhan C']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8724-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6099-3313', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8458-9649', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4336-1071']","['CLL Program, Division of Hematological Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'CLL Program, Division of Hematological Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'New York Presbyterian & Weill Cornell, New York, New York.', 'Center for Blood Disorders and Stem Cell Transplantation, Swedish Cancer Institute, Seattle, Western Australia.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Cellular Therapy, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.', 'Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia.', 'New York Presbyterian & Weill Cornell, New York, New York.', 'Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, University of Melbourne, East Melbourne, VI, Australia.', 'Peter McCallum Cancer Centre, University of Melbourne, East Melbourne, VI, Australia.', 'Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas Healthcare System, Charlotte, North Carolina.', 'Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire.', 'New York Presbyterian & Weill Cornell, New York, New York.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Western Australia.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Penn State Health, Hershey, Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Wilmot Cancer Institute, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York.', 'Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Abington Hematology/Oncology Associates Inc., Willow Grove, Pennsylvania.', 'Division of Hematology & Oncology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, District of Columbia.', 'Cardinal Health, Dublin, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180926,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC7552812,,,,2018/08/23 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/23 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25261 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1394-1401. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25261.

The current study evaluated cell signaling regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt, and 5'AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to autophagy and apoptosis induced by sorafenib. Sorafenib induced early (3-12 hr) ER stress characterized by an increase of (Ser51) P-eIF2alpha/eIF2alpha, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), IRE1alpha, and sXBP1, but a decrease of activating transcription factor 6 expression, overall temporally associated with the increase of (Thr183,Tyr185) P-JNK1/2/JNK1/2, (Thr172) P-AMPKalpha, (Ser413) P-Foxo3a, (Thr308) P-AKt/AKt and (Thr32) P-Foxo3a/Foxo3a ratios, and reduction of (Ser2481) P-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/mTOR and protein translation. This pattern was related to a transient increase of tBid, Bim EL , Beclin-1, Bcl-xL, Bcl-2, autophagy markers, and reduction of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) expression. The progressive increase of CHOP expression, and reduction of (Thr308) P-AKt/AKt and (Ser473) P-AKt/AKt ratios were associated with the reduction of autophagic flux and an additional upregulation of Bim EL expression and caspase-3 activity (24 hr). Small interfering-RNA (si-RNA) assays showed that Bim, but not Bak and Bax, was involved in the induction of caspase-3 in sorafenib-treated HepG2 cells. Sorafenib increased autophagic and apoptotic markers in tumor-derived xenograft model. In conclusion, the early sorafenib-induced ER stress and regulation of JNK and AMPK-dependent signaling were related to the induction of survival autophagic process. The sustained drug treatment induced a progressive increase of ER stress and PERK-CHOP-dependent rise of Bim EL , which was associated with the shift from autophagy to apoptosis. The kinetic of Bim EL expression profile might also be related to the tight balance between AKt- and AMPK-related signaling leading to Foxo3a-dependent BIM EL upregulation.","['(c) 2018 Wiley

However, the correlation between ITGA2 expression and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is still unclear. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was carried out to analyze ITGA2 messenger RNA level. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and bisulfite sequencing PCR were performed to detect the methylation of ITGA2 promoter. ITGA2 expression was significantly upregulated in 134 de novo AML patients compared with 33 controls (p = 0.007). ITGA2(high) group had markedly lower complete remission (CR) rate than ITGA2(low) group (p = 0.011). Furthermore, the overall survival in ITGA2(high) patients was significantly shorter than ITGA2(low) patients throughout AML cohort, non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and cytogenetic normal-AML (p = 0.001, 0.002, and 0.044, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that ITGA2 overexpression served as an independent prognostic factor in both whole-cohort AML patients (p = 0.018) and non-APL AML patients (p = 0.021). Besides, ITGA2 expression level was significantly decreased in AML patients after CR (p = 0.011), and was returned at the time of relapse phase (p = 0.021). Moreover, unmethylated ITGA2 promoter was identified in normal controls, leukemia cell lines, and primary leukemia cells with low or high ITGA2 expression. In conclusions, methylation-independent ITGA2 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in AML.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lian, Xin-Yue', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Wu, De-Hong', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Zhang, Zhi-Hui', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Lian XY', 'Zhang W', 'Wu DH', 'Ma JC', 'Zhou JD', 'Zhang ZH', 'Wen XM', 'Xu ZJ', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4704-9157', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2649-8121']","[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, The Third People's Hospital of Kunshan City, Kunshan, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.', ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China."", 'The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180821,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,['0 (Integrin alpha2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ITGA2', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*expression', '*methylation', '*prognosis']",,2018/08/23 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/08/23 06:00'],"['2017/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26866 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Dec;233(12):9584-9593. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26866.

Not all AML patients are candidates for the mainstay induction and consolidation treatment options. In addition, despite available therapies, most patients will eventually relapse on, or be refractory to, standard induction therapy, with limited subsequent choices and poor prognosis. Recently, several new and emerging therapies, with a variety of mechanisms of action, have broadened the treatment landscape in newly diagnosed and relapsed/refractory (R/R) AML, providing patients and healthcare providers with more options and several targeted treatment approaches. Preclinical data indicate that the anti-apoptotic protein myeloid cell leukemia-1 (MCL-1) is important to AML cell survival. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9), a transcriptional activator necessary for the expression of MCL-1, represents a promising target for future AML therapies. A number of CDK9 inhibitors, as well as several direct MCL-1 inhibitors, are currently in clinical or preclinical development. The CDK9 inhibitors alvocidib, atuveciclib, and TG02 have completed phase 1/2 clinical trials, with results available for the alvocidib trial showing improved complete remission rates (70% vs 46%; P = .003) for alvocidib in combination with cytarabine and mitoxantrone, versus cytarabine/daunorubicin, in patients with newly diagnosed AML. In addition, several phase 1 clinical trials with CDK9 inhibitors are currently recruiting for treatment of advanced AML. A phase 1b study is also ongoing to investigate alvocidib in combination with B-cell lymphoma-2 inhibitor venetoclax for R/R AML.

Despite advances in the management of hematologic malignancies, the development of novel targeted and immune therapies, and improvements in supportive care, the overall outcome for patients with AML remains poor due to several factors, including increased frequency in the older population, poor response to chemotherapy, high relapse rates, and limited effective therapy options in relapsed patients. In addition, AML presents a substantial clinical and financial burden attributable in part to the heterogenic characteristics at presentation, such as varied age distributions and cytogenetic and molecular abnormalities, coupled with prolonged hospitalizations, high rates of infectious complications, and need for allogeneic stem cell transplants. Several unmet needs exist in AML. For instance, more-effective, less-toxic treatments are urgently needed because many patients with AML are not candidates for standard induction therapy. AML is also characterized by high rates of relapsed/refractory disease; therefore, strategies to reduce relapse are important. Other unmet needs center on poor quality of life from disease- and therapy-related toxicities and inadequate psychosocial support frequently experienced by many patients with AML and by their caregivers.

In this study, we describe a cohort study for the verification of miR143 expression, as well as the investigation of the molecular mechanisms of miR143 in MDS/acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a series of experiments, miR143 recombinant lentiviral vectors transformed into SKM1 cells were either overexpressed or knocked down, and the results illustrated that the overexpression of miR143 inhibited SKM1 cell growth, arrested the SKM1 cells in the G0/G1 phase, interfered with cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis via the Fas/FasL pathway. Conversely, miR143 knockdown induced a decrease in the apoptosis and promoted the proliferation of SKM1 cells. Moreover, miR143 was shown to suppress MLLT3/AF9 expression by binding to its 3'UTR. Taken together, the findings of this study indicate that miR143 may be a critical regulator of MDS/AML cell carcinogenesis, acting as a potent antitumour molecular target for the diagnosis or treatment of cancers associated with the abnormal expression of MLLT3/AF9, hence facilitating the development of potential therapeutics against MDS/AML.",,"['Cui, Jiaqi', 'Wei, Chunmei', 'Deng, Linli', 'Kuang, Xingyi', 'Zhang, Zengtie', 'Pierides, Chryso', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Cui J', 'Wei C', 'Deng L', 'Kuang X', 'Zhang Z', 'Pierides C', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, P.R.

An understanding of the magnitude and variation of doses from these sources is important, and the ability to predict them is required for epidemiological studies. In the present paper, indoor measurements of naturally occurring gamma-rays at representative locations in Great Britain are summarized. It is shown that, although the individual measurement data appear unimodal, the distribution of gamma-ray dose-rates when averaged over relatively small areas, which probably better represents the underlying distribution with inter-house variation reduced, appears bimodal. The dose-rate distributions predicted by three empirical and geostatistical models are also bimodal and compatible with the distributions of the areally averaged dose-rates. The distribution of indoor gamma-ray dose-rates in the UK is compared with those in other countries, which also tend to appear bimodal (or possibly multimodal). The variation of indoor gamma-ray dose-rates with geology, socio-economic status of the area, building type, and period of construction are explored. The factors affecting indoor dose-rates from background gamma radiation are complex and frequently intertwined, but geology, period of construction, and socio-economic status are influential; the first is potentially most influential, perhaps, because it can be used as a general proxy for local building materials. Various statistical models are tested for predicting indoor gamma-ray dose-rates at unmeasured locations. Significant improvements over previous modelling are reported. The dose-rate estimates generated by these models reflect the imputed underlying distribution of dose-rates and provide acceptable predictions at geographical locations without measurements.",,"['Kendall, G M', 'Chernyavskiy, P', 'Appleton, J D', 'Miles, J C H', 'Wakeford, R', 'Athanson, M', 'Vincent, T J', 'McColl, N P', 'Little, M P']","['Kendall GM', 'Chernyavskiy P', 'Appleton JD', 'Miles JCH', 'Wakeford R', 'Athanson M', 'Vincent TJ', 'McColl NP', 'Little MP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9195-754X'],"['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, NDPH, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Headington, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.

To identify the partners that interact with each member of the CADM family proteins, we set up a platform for multiple detection of the extracellular protein-protein interactions using surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) and analyzed the interactions between the CADM family proteins and 10 IgSF of their structurally related cell adhesion molecules. SPRi analysis identified a new interaction between CADM1 and CADM4, where this heterophilic interaction was shown to be involved in morphological spreading of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) cells expressing CADM1 when incubated on CADM4-coated glass. Moreover, class-I MHC-restricted T-cell-associated molecule (CRTAM) was identified to show the highest affinity to CADM1 among its binding partners by comparing the dissociation constants calculated from the SPR sensorgrams.

While clinical prognostic factors of survival have been identified, the contribution of patient-reported symptoms has only received marginal attention. Fatigue is one of the most commonly reported symptoms of AML. There is some evidence that fatigue is associated with shorter survival in hematological malignancies. However, the prognostic effects of fatigue in a homogenous cohort of patients with untreated AML has not been tested. We here report results of a prospective study on the prognostic value of patient-reported fatigue prior to onset of treatment, for 2-year survival in 94 AML patients. Cox regression models controlling for demographic and clinical factors showed that those with severe fatigue (22%) had decreased survival rates (Hr = 2.255, 95% CI = 1.16-5.60, p = 0.019). Further exploration showed that fatigue was associated with increased plasma concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, but not with demographic or disease-related factors. In conclusion, we here show for the first time that the experience of severe fatigue prior to remission induction chemotherapy (IC) is prognostic for shorter survival in patients with AML of all ages. These findings point to the importance of interventions aimed at relieving fatigue especially before or in the early phases of treatment in order to improve survival.",,"['Lacourt, Tamara E', 'Kavelaars, Annemieke', 'Ohanian, Maro', 'Shah, Nina D', 'Shelburne, Samuel A', 'Futreal, Andrew', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Heijnen, Cobi J']","['Lacourt TE', 'Kavelaars A', 'Ohanian M', 'Shah ND', 'Shelburne SA', 'Futreal A', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Heijnen CJ']",,"['Neuroimmunology Laboratory, Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Neuroimmunology Laboratory, Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Genomic Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control, and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Neuroimmunology Laboratory, Department of Symptom Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180727,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6101294,['NOTNLM'],"['Cox regression', 'Kaplan-Meier', 'fatigue', 'mortality', 'patient-reported outcome']",['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.'],2018/08/23 06:00,2018/08/23 06:01,['2018/08/23 06:00'],"['2018/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/23 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25787 [doi]', '25787 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jul 27;9(58):31244-31252. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25787. eCollection 2018 Jul 27.,58,31244-31252,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and methods: A prospective noninvasive study comprising 43 acute lymphocytic leukemic pediatric patients at various stages of therapy. They were examined on day of their each blood examination, and lesions were recorded on a self-designed pro forma. A total of 133 observations were recorded by a single observer. The treatment was divided into the phase of induction, consolidation, maintenance, and relapse. Results: The data were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 10.1. There were 24 males and 19 females in this study, aged between 3 and 13 years. The common oral lesions seen were dental caries, lymphadenopathy (86.04%), pallor (65.11%), ulcers (13.95%), mucositis (16.27%), gingival enlargement, hemorrhages (20.93%), candidiasis, herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, xerostomia (44.18%), paresthesia, and tooth mobility. Herpes simplex virus infection was seen only during induction and consolidation phases. Ulcers were seen during all phases of therapy. Clinical significance: Orofacial manifestations may be seen as the first sign of leukemia and a dentist may play a significant role in the diagnosis of the disease per se. This study highlights not only about commonly occurring lesions but also their variation during various phases of therapy. To the best of our knowledge, no study has such an extensive reporting of orofacial manifestations of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patients under treatment.How to cite this article: Aggarwal A, Pai KM.

Here we demonstrate that TYK2 is highly expressed in all cases of human ALCL, and that in a mouse model of NPM-ALK-induced lymphoma, genetic disruption of Tyk2 delays the onset of tumors and prolongs survival of the mice. Lymphomas in this model lacking Tyk2 have reduced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and reduced expression of Mcl1, a pro-survival member of the BCL2 family. These findings in mice are mirrored in human ALCL cell lines, in which TYK2 is activated by autocrine production of IL-10 and IL-22 and by interaction with specific receptors expressed by the cells. Activated TYK2 leads to STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation, activated expression of MCL1 and aberrant ALCL cell survival. Moreover, TYK2 inhibitors are able to induce apoptosis in ALCL cells, regardless of the presence or absence of an ALK-fusion. Thus, TYK2 is a dependency that is required for ALCL cell survival through activation of MCL1 expression. TYK2 represents an attractive drug target due to its essential enzymatic domain, and TYK2-specific inhibitors show promise as novel targeted inhibitors for ALCL.",,"['Prutsch, Nicole', 'Gurnhofer,

Therefore, current research focuses on reducing long-term sequelae of treatment. Osteonecrosis (ON) is a severe long-term complication of HL treatment which has so far not been systematically evaluated. Hence, we investigated incidence, risk factors and timing of symptomatic ON in HL patients. Further endpoints included localization, intervention and outcome of ON. We included all qualified HL patients of the randomized German Hodgkin Study Group trials HD10-15 and HD18, recruited between 05/1998 and 07/2014 and aged from 16 to 60 years. Among 11 330 patients, 66 developed symptomatic ON after first-line treatment, 83.3% within three years. The incidence of symptomatic ON was 0.2% in early-stage HL and 1.0% in advanced-stage HL. Logistic regression revealed the total cumulative corticosteroid dose to be a strong risk factor interacting with younger age. Male sex additionally increased the risk of symptomatic ON. The prognostic value of the corresponding logistic regression model was rather high (AUC = 0.78). Other tested potential risk factors including obesity, IPS and radiotherapy did not further increase the risk of ON.

This paper describes work done by the Childhood Cancer Research Group (CCRG) on this topic METHODS: Most UK investigations have made use of the National Registry of Childhood Tumours and associated controls. Epidemiological investigations have included national incidence and mortality analyses, geographical investigations, record linkage and case-control studies. Dosimetric studies use biokinetic and dosimetric modelling. RESULTS: This paper reviews the work of the CCRG on the association between exposure to ionising radiation and childhood cancer, 1975-2014. CONCLUSION: The work of CCRG has been influential in developing understanding of the causes of 'clusters' of childhood cancer and the risks arising from exposure to ionising radiation both natural and man-made. Some clusters around nuclear installations have certainly been observed, but ionising radiation does not seem to be a plausible cause. The group's work has also been instrumental in discounting the hypothesis that paternal preconception irradiation was a cause of childhood cancers and has demonstrated an increased leukaemia risk for children exposed to higher levels of natural gamma-ray radiation.",,"['Kendall, Gerald M', 'Bithell, John F', 'Bunch, Kathryn J', 'Draper, Gerald J', 'Kroll, Mary E', 'Murphy, Michael F G', 'Stiller, Charles A', 'Vincent, Tim J']","['Kendall GM', 'Bithell JF', 'Bunch KJ', 'Draper GJ', 'Kroll ME', 'Murphy MFG', 'Stiller CA', 'Vincent TJ']",,"['Cancer Epidemiology Unit, Nuffield Department of Population Health, University of Oxford, Richard Doll Building, Old Road Campus, Oxford, OX3 7LF, UK.

BLT1 is phosphorylated at several serine and threonine residues upon stimulation with the inflammatory lipid LTB4 Using Phos-tag gel electrophoresis to separate differentially phosphorylated forms of BLT1, we identified two distinct types of phosphorylation, basal and ligand-induced, in the carboxyl terminus of human BLT1. In the absence of LTB4, the basal phosphorylation sites were modified to various degrees, giving rise to many different phosphorylated forms of BLT1. Different concentrations of LTB4 induced distinct phosphorylation events, and these ligand-induced modifications facilitated additional phosphorylation events at the basal phosphorylation sites. Because neutrophils migrate toward inflammatory sites along a gradient of LTB4, the degree of BLT1 phosphorylation likely increases in parallel with the increase in LTB4 concentration as the cells migrate. At high concentrations of LTB4, deficiencies in these two types of phosphorylation events impaired chemotaxis and beta-hexosaminidase release, a proxy for degranulation, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, respectively. These results suggest that an LTB4 gradient around inflammatory sites enhances BLT1 phosphorylation in a stepwise manner to facilitate the precise migration of phagocytic and immune cells and the initiation of local responses, including degranulation.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American', 'Association for the Advancement of Science.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells targeting tumor-associated antigens have shown promise in the treatment of some malignancies. However, CAR-T cell development for AML has been limited by lack of an antigen with high specificity for AML cells that is not present on normal hematopoietic stem cells, and thus will not result in myelotoxicity. Here we demonstrate that leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor-B4 (LILRB4) is a tumor-associated antigen highly expressed on monocytic AML cells. We generated a novel anti-LILRB4 CAR-T cell that displays high antigen affinity and specificity. These CAR-T cells display efficient effector function in vitro and in vivo against LILRB4(+) AML cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate anti-LILRB4 CAR-T cells are not toxic to normal CD34(+) umbilical cord blood cells in colony-forming unit assays, nor in a humanized hematopoietic-reconstituted mouse model. Our data demonstrate that anti-LILRB4 CAR-T cells specifically target monocytic AML cells with no toxicity to normal hematopoietic progenitors. This work thus offers a new treatment strategy to improve outcomes for monocytic AML, with the potential for elimination of leukemic disease while minimizing the risk for on-target off-tumor toxicity.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

As an oncometabolite, 2-HG can cause epigenetic changes and impair cell differentiation. Inhibiting the activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutants (mIDH) is considered to be an effective therapy for the treatment of mIDH positive cancers, including glioma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The presently disclosed allosteric inhibitors work only on one of the mIDH1 and mIDH2, and it is shown that mIDH1 and mIDH2 have different allosteric inhibition pockets. However, AG-881 from Agios Pharmaceuticals was found to be a pan-IDH inhibitor against both mIDH1 and mIDH2, and is undergoing Phase I clinical trials for tumors with an IDH1 and/or IDH2 mutation. To understand the binding mode of AG-881 to mIDHs, we solved the crystal structures of IDH1-R132H/NADPH/AG-881 and IDH2-R140Q/NADPH/AG-881 complexes, and acquired the IC50 values of AG-881 for IDH1-R132H and IDH2-R140Q homodimers after different pre-incubation times. Our data show that AG-881 binds IDH1-R132H and IDH2-R140Q in the same allosteric pockets and that the subtle difference in the pockets of these two proteins may contribute to their remarkably different inhibitory kinetics by AG-881. The structural pharmacological data provided in this report may benefit the future development of pan-IDH inhibitors targeting mIDH1 and mIDH2.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We used decellularized Wharton's jelly matrix (DWJM), the gelatinous material in the umbilical cord, as a scaffolding material to culture leukemia cells, because it contains many components of the bone marrow extracellular matrix, including collagen, fibronectin, lumican, and hyaluronic acid (HA). Leukemia cells cultured in DWJM demonstrated decreased proliferation without undergoing significant differentiation. After culture in DWJM, these cells also exhibited changes in morphology, acquiring a spindle-shaped appearance, and an increase in the ALDH(+) cell population. When treated with a high-dose of doxorubicin, leukemia cells in DWJM demonstrated less apoptosis compared with cells in suspension. Serial colony forming unit (CFU) assays indicated that leukemia cells cultured in DWJM showed increased colony-forming ability after both primary and secondary plating. Leukemia cell culture in DWJM was associated with increased N-cadherin expression by flow cytometry.

We analyzed the impact of the mutation on NPM interaction with nucleolin (NCL) which is also prevalently localized into the nucleolus and cooperates with wild-type NPM (NPMwt) in many cellular processes.

This study explored use of MRD testing in adult and pediatric B-cell ALL patients, and academic versus community settings. METHODS: A survey was administered to US-based hematologists/oncologists currently managing >/=5 B-cell ALL patients and using MRD tests. Descriptive analyses (frequencies and percentages) and Pearson's chi square testing assessed any differences in various characteristics. RESULTS: 150 adult treaters (treating physicians: 100 community, 50 academic) and 30 pediatric treaters participated. Use of MRD testing was higher among pediatric treaters (93% of patients) than adult treaters (73% of patients) (p < 0.05), and higher among adult treaters at academic centers than in community settings (84% and 67% of patients, respectively; p < 0.01). MRD testing is part of a standard protocol for 93% of pediatric treaters versus 53% of adult treaters. Pediatric treaters most commonly administer an MRD test during/after induction or upon relapse. No consensus on timing among adult treaters was noted. DISCUSSION: MRD testing is an important tool in the prediction of relapse in ALL. Resolving barriers could improve detection of molecular relapse in patients with ALL, particularly among adults and in community settings.

Using ibrutinib data from the RESONATE-2 (PCYC-1115/1116) study conducted in patients >/=65 years without del(17p), we performed a cross-trial comparison with CIT data from published phase 3 studies in first-line treatment of CLL. Progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety data for ibrutinib (median follow-up 35.7 months) were evaluated alongside available CIT data. CIT regimens included: fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab (CLL8, CLL10), bendamustine + rituximab (CLL10), obinutuzumab + chlorambucil and rituximab + chlorambucil (CLL11), and ofatumumab + chlorambucil (COMPLEMENT-1). Median age across studies was 61-74 years, with older populations receiving ibrutinib, obinutuzumab + chlorambucil, or rituximab + chlorambucil. Median follow-up varied across studies/regimens (range 14.5-37.4 months). Among all patients, PFS appeared longer with ibrutinib relative to CIT and OS appeared comparable. Relative to CIT studies that similarly excluded patients with del(17p) (CLL10) or enrolled older/less-fit patients (CLL11), PFS appeared favorable for ibrutinib in high-risk subgroups, including advanced disease, bulky lymph nodes, unmutated IGHV status, and presence of del(11q). Grade >/= 3 infections ranged from 9% (ofatumumab + chlorambucil) to 40% (fludarabine + cyclophosphamide + rituximab), and was 25% with ibrutinib. Grade >/= 3 neutropenia was 12% for ibrutinib and 26%-84% for CIT. Although definitive conclusions cannot be made due to inherent limitations of cross-trial comparisons, this report suggests that ibrutinib has a favorable benefit/risk profile and may potentially eliminate the need for chemotherapy in some patients. Randomized, comparative studies are needed to support these findings.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Immunoglobulin (Ig) replacement reduces major infections but not mortality, and is costly. No prospective randomised trials have compared Ig replacement with prophylactic antibiotics. AIMS: To identify variation in current practice regarding management of secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia in Australia and New Zealand, to identify barriers to best practice, and to inform the development of a clinical trial assessing antibiotic prophylaxis in secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia. METHODS: We conducted an online survey of current clinical practice regarding management of secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia among haematologists in Australia and New Zealand. RESULTS: Seventy-two haematologists responded; 89% of whom reported commencing Ig replacement for secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia in the setting of recurrent or severe infection. Most monitored trough immunoglobulin G levels, most often 3 monthly. Criteria for stopping Ig replacement varied. Most respondents recommended influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, while only 21% reported using antibiotic prophylaxis. Few respondents (3%) reported prescribing prophylactic antibiotics before commencing Ig replacement.

CONCLUSION: In comparison to limited international data, this survey finds variation in practice, which may be due to differences in local policies governing access to Ig.

A variety of techniques that use polymorphic markers have been established to survey hematopoietic chimerism status. The highest sensitivity is achieved using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) analysis of insertion/deletion polymorphism, which allows the detection of disease recurrence and subsequently the earlier initiation of therapeutic intervention. The purpose of this study is the evaluation of multiplex RQ-PCR for MC assessment (six biallelic genetic systems and Y-specific locus), allowing the amplification and detection of target gene of interest and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase reference housekeeping gene in a single microtube. With optimized amounts of primers and probe, the quantification of target DNA was shown to be linear throughout the tested range (100%-0.05%). The efficiencies of multiplex RQ-PCR were in a range of 0.89 to 1.07. The sensitivity of individual systems ranged 0.02% to 0.04% with an average of 0.034%. A high degree of linear correlation between the chimerism results obtained by multiplex RQ-PCR vs singleplex RQ-PCR was observed (P < 0.0001, Spearman's coefficient = 0.9927), while correlation between multiplex RQ-PCR vs short tandem repeat analysis was also statistically significant (P < 0.0001, Spearman's coefficient = 0.9769).

Somatic mutation E76K in SHP2 is the most commonly identified mutation found in up to 35% of patients with JMML. To investigate the effect of gain-of-function mutation-E76K on SHP2 activity, molecular dynamic simulations on the wild-type SHP2 (SHP2-WT) system and the mutated E76K (SHP2-E76K) system were performed. The evaluation of stability of these two systems indicated that the simulated trajectories were stable after simulation for 3 nanoseconds. The root mean square fluctuation and the per-residue root mean square deviation illustrated that there were two regions (residues Tyr 81-Glu 83 and Glu 258-Leu 261) in the wild-type system and the mutated system, which had large differences. The principal component analysis, dynamic cross correlation maps analysis, as well as secondary structure analysis suggested that the mutated E76K impacted the movement of these two regions in SHP2 protein. Furthermore, residue interaction network analysis, hydrogen bond occupancy, and binding free energies analysis were used to explain how the two regions were specifically affected by the mutant. The results indicated that the primary variances between SHP2-WT and SHP2-E76K were the different interactions between Glu/Lys 76 and Arg 265, Tyr 80 and Leu 77, Leu 77 and Tyr 81, Thr 73 and Glu 258, Ala 75 and Cys 259, Phe 71 and Tyr 81, Ala 75 and Glu 258, and Tyr 73 and Glu/Lys 76. Consequently, these findings here might provide insights into the increased activity in SHP2-E76K.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Li, Wei-Ya', 'Wei, Hui-Yu', 'Sun, Ying-Zhan', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Ma, Ying', 'Wang, Run-Ling']","['Li WY', 'Wei HY', 'Sun YZ', 'Zhou H', 'Ma Y', 'Wang RL']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9501-6483'],"['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Eye Hospital, School of Optometry and Ophthalmology, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics (Theranostics), School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180820,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN11 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11)']",IM,"['*Gain of Function Mutation', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*genetics', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 11/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*SHP2-E76K', '*juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML)', '*molecular dynamic (MD) simulation', '*mutation', '*post-dynamic analysis']",,2018/08/22 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27316 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Dec;119(12):9941-9956. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27316.

Persistent minimal residual disease (MRD) after induction repeatedly correlated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS). However, none of the published studies analyzed patients treated with RM. The main purpose was to analyze prognostic significance of MRD in the elderly patients with newly diagnosed MCL treated according to the recently published observational trial protocol (alternation of R-CHOP and R-cytarabine, 3 + 3 cycles, GovTrial number NCT03054883) at the centers that implemented RM. Minimal residual disease was evaluated by a EuroMRD standardized real-time PCR approach after 3 and 6 cycles of the induction therapy. Prognostic significance of MRD was analyzed in a subcohort of patients treated at the centers that implemented RM as a standard approach. Bone marrow proved to be a significantly more sensitive source for MRD detection than peripheral blood. In either compartment MRD (positive versus negative) after 3 or 6 cycles of the induction therapy did not correlate with PFS.

Objective: To evaluate the frequency and types of oral conditions presented by patients on a hematology ward. Methods: Data were collected by oral examinations during weekly visits to a hematology ward. Six trained dentists performed the oral assessment based on the principles of oral semiology. All patients who accepted to be examined were included in the study. Patients who were unavailable or unable to have oral examinations were excluded. Data were recorded on protocol forms and in the electronic records of the institution. A descriptive analysis was performed. Results: Seventy-nine patients were included in the analysis; 50.6% were female and the mean age was 41.49 years. The most common reasons for hospitalization were chemotherapy and complications (81%), relapse (13.9%) and pre-transplant preparation (5%). The most frequent underlying diseases were multiple myeloma (17.7%), acute myeloid leukemia (15.4%) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (11.5%). Oral conditions were found in 36 (45.6%) patients, some of whom presented more than one condition. The most common oral conditions were dry lips (12.6%), mucositis (10.1%), petechiae (8.9%) and candidiasis (7.6%). Of the detected oral conditions, 56.9% were related to the underlying disease or chemotherapy and 20.2% were not related to the disease.

To address this problem, we designed a novel theranostic strategy of DNA nanotriangle-scaffolded multivalent split activatable aptamer probe (NTri-SAAP), which combines advantages of programmable self-assembly, multivalent effect and target-activatable architecture. Methods: NTri-SAAP was assembled by conjugating multiple split activatable aptamer probes (SAAPs) on a planar DNA nanotriangle scaffold (NTri). Leukemia CCRF-CEM cell line was used as the model to investigate its detection, imaging and therapeutic effect both in vitro and in vivo. Binding affinity and stability were evaluated using flow cytometry and nuclease resistance assays. Results: In the free state, NTri-SAAP was stable with quenched signals and loaded doxorubicin, while upon binding to target cells, it underwent a conformation change with fluorescence activation and drug release after internalization. Compared to monovalent SAAP, NTri-SAAP displayed greatly-improved target binding affinity, ultralow nonspecific background and robust stability in harsh conditions, thus affording contrast-enhanced tumor imaging within an extended time window of 8 h. Additionally, NTri-SAAP increased doxorubicin loading capacity by ~5 times, which further realized a high anti-tumor efficacy in vivo with 81.95% inhibition but no obvious body weight loss. Conclusion: These results strongly suggest that the biocompatible NTri-SAAP strategy would provide a promising platform for precise and high-quality theranostics.",,"['Lei, Yanli', 'Qiao, Zhenzhen', 'Tang, Jinlu', 'He, Xiaoxiao', 'Shi, Hui', 'Ye, Xiaosheng', ""Yan, Lv'an"", 'He, Dinggeng', 'Wang, Kemin']","['Lei Y', 'Qiao Z', 'Tang J', 'He X', 'Shi H', 'Ye X', 'Yan L', 'He D', 'Wang K']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemo/Biosensing and Chemometrics, College of Biology, College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Hunan University, Key Laboratory for Bio-Nanotechnology and Molecular Engineering of Hunan Province, Changsha 410082, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180716,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Aptamers, Nucleotide)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Aptamers, Nucleotide/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Carriers/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Mice, Nude', 'Models, Theoretical', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/*methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Nanoparticles/*administration & dosage', 'Theranostic Nanomedicine/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6096399,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA self-assembly', '*activatable imaging', '*cancer theranostics', '*multivalent effect', '*split aptamer']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2018/08/22 06:00,2019/09/05 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/01/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.24683 [doi]', 'thnov08p4062 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2018 Jul 16;8(15):4062-4071. doi: 10.7150/thno.24683. eCollection 2018.,15,4062-4071,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Arsenic trioxide is a traditional Chinese medicine, which has been previously identified as an efficient tumor suppressor, particularly in the treatment of acute pro-myelocytic leukemia. However, studies have also reported that long-term exposure to arsenicals may lead to the formation of malignant tumors. In the present study, the effect of low-dose arsenic trioxide on the proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells was investigated, as were the potential underlying mechanisms of this effect. The data demonstrated that low-dose arsenic trioxide (0.1 microM) enhanced the viability and apoptosis of tumor cells expressing hERG channels following long-term incubation. However, in tumor cells lacking hERG channels, low-dose arsenic trioxide had no effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that this hormesis effect of low-dose arsenic trioxide on tumor cells may be associated with the hERG channel. Furthermore, low dose arsenic trioxide promoted the hERG-channel current by changing the kinetics of channel gating and prolonging the open-channel stage. Simultaneously, high-dose As2O3 (1 or 10 microM) significantly reduced the expression of hERG in tumor cells compared with the control group, which resulted in reduced proliferation rate and promotion of apoptotic rate. The results of the present study demonstrate that the dual effects of arsenic trioxide on hERG channels vary according to concentration, resulting in the dual effects on tumor cells. This provides a theoretical basis for the potential clinical application of arsenic trioxide, suggesting that hERG channels are an important target in preventing and treating tumorigenesis during arsenicosis.",,"['Zhang, Xiao', 'Yu, Dahai', 'Geng, Huaize', 'Li, Fengmei', 'Lv, Lin', 'Zhao, Lei', 'Yan, Caichuan', 'Li, Baoxin']","['Zhang X', 'Yu D', 'Geng H', 'Li F', 'Lv L', 'Zhao L', 'Yan C', 'Li B']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, College of Pharmacy, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang 150086, P.R.

PI staining showed that ailanthone increased the percentage of G0/G1-phase cells in a dose-dependent manner. Acridine orange staining suggested that ailanthone induced the formation of acidic vesicular organelles in HL-60 cells and pretreatment with BaF-A1 could attenuate this process. Western blotting showed that ailanthone up-regulated the protein expression levels of beclin-1 and LC3-II and down-regulated those of LC3-I and p62 in a dose-dependent manner.

Focal hyperproliferation was frequently identified in the vertebral body, breast bones and iliac bones. Bone marrow maximum standardized uptake values (SUV) of AA were associated, to certain extents, with the degree of proliferation and the bone marrow T/B cell ratio. The overall bone marrow SUV of AA were lower compared with those of healthy individuals and AL or patients with MDS, indicating hypometabolism.

A total of 390 pediatric patients diagnosed as B-ALL and receiving regular chemotherapy in Jining First People's Hospital from August 2010 to May 2016 were selected. The clinical characteristics, therapeutic response and prognosis were compared between the two groups. There were significant differences in the comparisons of age, leukocyte count in the initial diagnosis and glucocorticoid sensitive test between B-cell ALL (B-ALL) relapse group and non-relapse group; the minimal residual disease (MRD) levels of pediatric patients in the two groups at 33 days and 12 weeks were significantly different. The 3-year event-free survival (EFS) rates of pediatric patients with early, medium and late B-ALL relapse were 12.5+/-7.8%, 33.1+/-9.8% and 63.6+/-6.1%, respectively, and the prognosis of late relapse was significantly better than that of early relapse (P<0.001). The 3-year EFS rates of pediatric patients with bone marrow relapse in standard risk group, intermediate risk group and high risk group were 29.1+/-6.9, 31.3+/-6.5 and 28.3+/-6.3%, respectively; there were no statistically significant differences (P=0.387, P>0.05). Pediatric patients with B-ALL relapse are characterized by higher onset age (>/=10 years old), high leukocyte count and hormone insensitivity. Dynamic monitoring of MRD level in B-ALL pediatric patients can predict the relapse.",,"['Zhang, Xiaohong', 'Wu, Haixia', 'Fan, Hong', 'Su, Baifang', 'Zhang, Ge', 'Dong, Lin']","['Zhang X', 'Wu H', 'Fan H', 'Su B', 'Zhang G', 'Dong L']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Jining First People's Hospital, Jining, Shandong 272000, P.R.

Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are potent regulators of immune responses, protect from lethal GVHD, and promote graft-versus-leukemia effects in murine studies. Since iNKT cells constitute less than 0.5% of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in vitro expansion with their glycolipid ligands is required before they can be used for cytotherapy and experimental purposes. Three weeks of cell culture and autologous restimulation with either KRN7000, PBS44, or PBS57 resulted in a robust proliferation of iNKT cells from human PBMCs. Next, iNKT cells were sorted to a purity higher than 90% being crucial for further experimental and clinical applications. These iNKT cells significantly decreased activation and proliferation of allogeneic CD3+ T lymphocytes. In addition, leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells were efficiently lysed by culture-expanded iNKT cells. Importantly, culture-expanded donor iNKT cells promoted robust antileukemia activity against HLA-matched allogeneic patient leukemia cells. Our data indicate that the adoptive transfer of culture-expanded iNKT cells could be a powerful cytotherapeutic approach to induce immune tolerance and prevent leukemia relapse after allogeneic HCT in humans.",,"['Schmid, Hannes', 'Schneidawind, Corina', 'Jahnke, Simona', 'Kettemann, Felix', 'Secker, Kathy-Ann', 'Duerr-Stoerzer, Silke', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Savage, Paul B', 'Schneidawind, Dominik']","['Schmid H', 'Schneidawind C', 'Jahnke S', 'Kettemann F', 'Secker KA', 'Duerr-Stoerzer S', 'Keppeler H', 'Kanz L', 'Savage PB', 'Schneidawind D']",,"['Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, United States.', 'Department of Medicine II, University Hospital Tubingen, Eberhard Karls University, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180806,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Glycolipids)', '0 (Isoantigens)']",IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Glycolipids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isoantigens/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/*metabolism']",PMC6088196,['NOTNLM'],"['*cytotherapy', '*graft-versus-host disease', '*graft-versus-leukemia', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*invariant natural killer T cells']",,2018/08/22 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/04/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01817 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Aug 6;9:1817. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01817. eCollection 2018.,,1817,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, very less is known about value of Posaconazole prophylaxis in resource limited settings. This observational cohort study evaluated the incidence of fungal infection in patients with hematological malignancies undergoing induction chemotherapy with Posaconazole as antifungal prophylaxis and was compared with historical controls who received Fluconazole as fungal prophylaxis. The study was conducted from Oct 2013 to July 2015 in Department of Hematology of a tertiary care center. Fifty-three patients of acute myeloid leukemia on Posaconazole as fungal prophylaxis and 53 historical controls on Fluconazole as fungal prophylaxis were included for final analysis. Baseline characteristics were well matched between groups. Patients on Fluconazole were more likely to experience breakthrough IFDs (28.3 and 11.3%; p = 0.028) than in patients receiving Posaconazole prophylaxis. No significant difference was observed in overall, attributable mortality or in shift to first line antifungal. Both Posaconazole and Fluconazole were well tolerated with no major adverse effects requiring discontinuation of the drug. Minor side effects were seen in 39 and 47% patients in study and control group respectively. Vomiting and nausea were the commonest side effects seen in both study and control group (26 vs. 34% and 38 vs. 40% of patients, respectively).

Though nilotinib has been available in India since 2010, there is no report on its safety and toxicity from Indian patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. This is an analysis of efficacy and toxicity of nilotinib when used as a second line drug after failure or intolerance to imatinib. Thirty-seven patients started nilotinib [median age 46 years, median duration from diagnosis 5 years, 73% in chronic phase at time of switch] between 2010 to 2016. Reason for switch: failure of imatinib in 33 (89%) and intolerance in 4 (11%). Starting dose 600 mg/day. Dose modifications: 15 (40%) patients required initial dose modifications, but subsequently 25 (67%) patients could tolerate 600 mg/day. Nine (24%) patients were able to tolerate 800 mg/day. The commonest grade 3/4 toxicities were thrombocytopenia (n = 9, 24%), hyperbilirubinemia (n = 7, 18%) and leukopenia (n = 3, 8%). Six patients (16%) discontinued nilotinib due to toxicity while 8 (21%) stopped due to lack of efficacy. After a median duration of 14 months among those continuing nilotinib, 54% of patients responded which included 14 patients who achieved CHR and seven who achieved major molecular response.

The risk is specifically higher in patients from TB endemic areas. Patients (>/=12 years) with AL treated between January-2014 to January-2017 who developed TB were reviewed. Patients were classified into three groups: acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML) and a systematic analysis of clinical features and outcomes was conducted. Over the study period, 26 patients of AL developed TB. The median time to diagnosis of TB was 8 weeks (0-432 weeks) following the diagnosis of AL and it was comparable between the three leukemia groups. The diagnosis of TB required alteration of anti-leukemia therapy in 26.9% patients and rescheduling in another 42.3% patients. Therapy alteration/rescheduling were more frequent in patients with AML as compared to ALL and APML (p < 0.03, <0.04). Disseminated TB was more common in AML patients (p < 0.016). ATT could be successfully administered in 86.9% patients with improvement of TB. The incidence of ATT induced hepatitis was 34.9%. Mortality was directly attributable to TB in 10% patients. Managing tuberculosis remains a challenge during treatment of acute leukemia. With this analysis, we advocate for a need of early suspicion and evaluation for TB in patients receiving treatment for acute leukemia. Rescheduling and or alteration of anticancer therapy due to TB is associated with significantly higher mortality. Therefore, in carefully selected cases, antileukemia therapy should continue after starting ATT as early as possible.",,"['Jain, Arihant', 'Prakash, Gaurav', 'Singh, Charanpreet', 'Lad, Deepesh', 'Khadwal, Alka', 'Suri, Vikas', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Kumari, Savita', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Varma, Subhash']","['Jain A', 'Prakash G', 'Singh C', 'Lad D', 'Khadwal A', 'Suri V', 'Malhotra P', 'Kumari S', 'Varma N', 'Varma S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4142-1592'],"['1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '2Department of Hematology, PGIMER Chandigarh, Chandigarh, India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3', '1Department of Internal Medicine, Clinical Hematology Unit and BMT, PGIMER Chandigarh, 4th Floor, F Block, Chandigarh, 160012 India.0000 0004 1767 2903grid.415131.3']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20170912,India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,PMC6081343,['NOTNLM'],"['Acid fast bacilli', 'Acute leukemia', 'Anti tubercular therapy', 'Chemotherapy', 'Tuberculosis']","['Compliance with Ethical StandardsThere are no potential conflict of interest of', 'authors writing this article.This is a retrospective data analysis and does not', 'involve any human or animal intervention or experiment.Informed consent was', 'obtained before data analysis from participating subjects.']",2018/08/22 06:00,2018/08/22 06:01,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2017/08/11 00:00 [received]', '2017/09/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-017-0875-z [doi]', '875 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2018 Jul;34(3):430-442. doi: 10.1007/s12288-017-0875-z.

Patients from the pre-MRDneg group and the pre-MRDpos group had comparable outcomes. Compared to post-MRDneg patients, post-MRDpos patients had a higher incidence of relapse (100.0% vs. 8.3%, p < 0.001), lower incidences of overall survival (OS) (16.9% vs. 78.2%, p < 0.001) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) (0% vs. 76.5%, p < 0.001), and comparable probability of NRM (13.4% vs. 16.9%, p = 0.560). In a second set of analyses, all adult AML patients undergoing haplo-SCT were classified into the MRD(neg)/MRD(neg) group, the MRD decreasing group, and the MRD increasing group according to MRD dynamics by flow cytometry peri-SCT. Compared to the other two groups, patients from the MRD increasing group had higher cumulative incidences of relapse (MRD increasing, 100.0%; MRD(neg)/MRD(neg), 9.6%; MRD decreasing, 19.2%; p < 0.001) and worse probabilities of OS (MRD increasing, 28.5%; MRD(neg)/MRD(neg), 76.3%; MRD decreasing, 76.0%; p < 0.001) and LFS (MRD increasing, 0.0%; MRD(neg)/MRD(neg), 73.9%; MRD decreasing, 74.0%; p < 0.001).

Nevertheless, even the complete removal of cohesin has surprisingly little impact on steady-state gene transcription and enhancer activity. Here we show that cohesin is required for the core transcriptional response of primary macrophages to microbial signals, and for inducible enhancer activity that underpins inflammatory gene expression. Consistent with a role for inflammatory signals in promoting myeloid differentiation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HPSCs), cohesin mutations in HSPCs led to reduced inflammatory gene expression and increased resistance to differentiation-inducing inflammatory stimuli. These findings uncover an unexpected dependence of inducible gene expression on cohesin, link cohesin with myeloid differentiation, and may help explain the prevalence of cohesin mutations in human acute myeloid leukemia.",,"['Cuartero, Sergi', 'Weiss, Felix D', 'Dharmalingam, Gopuraja', 'Guo, Ya', 'Ing-Simmons, Elizabeth', 'Masella, Silvia', 'Robles-Rebollo, Irene', 'Xiao, Xiaolin', 'Wang, Yi-Fang', 'Barozzi, Iros', 'Djeghloul, Dounia', 'Amano, Mariane T', 'Niskanen, Henri', 'Petretto, Enrico', 'Dowell, Robin D', 'Tachibana, Kikue', 'Kaikkonen, Minna U', 'Nasmyth, Kim A', 'Lenhard, Boris', 'Natoli, Gioacchino', 'Fisher, Amanda G', 'Merkenschlager, Matthias']","['Cuartero S', 'Weiss FD', 'Dharmalingam G', 'Guo Y', 'Ing-Simmons E', 'Masella S', 'Robles-Rebollo I', 'Xiao X', 'Wang YF', 'Barozzi I', 'Djeghloul D', 'Amano MT', 'Niskanen H', 'Petretto E', 'Dowell RD', 'Tachibana K', 'Kaikkonen MU', 'Nasmyth KA', 'Lenhard B', 'Natoli G', 'Fisher AG', 'Merkenschlager M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0394-2429', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6294-0979', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2889-3288']","['Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Computational Regulatory Genomics Group, Integrative Biology Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery and Cancer, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Lymphocyte Development Group, Epigenetics Section, MRC London Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Hospital Sirio-Libanes, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'A.

Recent advancements, however, have identified several cytogenetic and molecular markers that have not only improved prognostication but have also led to the development of several new targeted therapies for specific subpopulations. In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved four new treatments with indications for fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3)-mutated AML (midostaurin), newly diagnosed or relapsed/refractory CD33+AML (gemtuzumab ozogamicin), newly diagnosed therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (CPX-351) and relapsed/refractory AML with an isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)2 mutation (enasidenib). These newly approved therapies have demonstrated improved response in their target populations in several pivotal clinical trials with some also demonstrating improved overall survival. Additional novel therapies in development for AML include agents that target B cell lymphoma 2, FLT3, IDH1, the ubiquitination pathway, as well as cell therapy using engineered T cells with chimeric antigen receptors. This review provides a summary of the four newly approved therapies for AML, as well as several promising therapies currently in development.","['(c) American Federation for Medical Research 2018.

It is morphologically and immunophenotypically indistinguishable from typical FL, characterized by restricted involvement of intestinal mucosa, and lacks extraintestinal manifestations. The molecular determinants of this distinct clinical behavior are largely unknown. Thirty-eight diagnostic biopsies from patients with DTFL were evaluated. The 10-year overall survival rate was 100% in clinically evaluable patients (n = 19). We compared the targeted mutation profile of DTFL (n = 31), limited-stage typical FL (LSTFL; n = 17), and advanced-stage typical FL (ASTFL; n = 241). The mutation frequencies of recurrently mutated genes, including CREBBP, TNFRSF14/HVEM, and EZH2 were not significantly different. However, KMT2D was less commonly mutated in DTFL (52%) and LSTFL (24%) as compared with ASTFL (79%). In ASTFL, 41% of KMT2D-mutated cases harbored multiple mutations in KMT2D, as compared with only 12% in LSTFL (P = .019) and 0% in DTFL (P < .0001). Whole exome and targeted sequencing of DTFL revealed high mutation frequencies of EEF1A1 (35%) and HVCN1 (22%). We compared the immune microenvironment gene expression signatures of DTFL (n = 8) and LSTFL (n = 7). DTFL clearly separated from LSTFL by unsupervised, hierarchical clustering of 147 chemokines and cytokines and was enriched for a chronic inflammation signature. In conclusion, the mutational landscape of DTFL is highly related to typical FL. The lower frequency of multiple mutations in KMT2D in DTFL and LSTFL indicates an increasing selection pressure for complete KMT2D loss in ASTFL pathogenesis. The highly dissimilar immune microenvironment of DTFL suggests a central role in the biology of this disease.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Hellmuth, Johannes C', 'Louissaint, Abner Jr', 'Szczepanowski, Monika', 'Haebe, Sarah', 'Pastore, Alessandro', 'Alig, Stefan', 'Staiger, Annette M', 'Hartmann, Sylvia', 'Kridel, Robert', 'Ducar, Matthew D', 'Koch, Peter', 'Dreyling, Martin', 'Hansmann, Martin-Leo', 'Ott, German', 'Rosenwald, Andreas', 'Gascoyne, Randy D', 'Weinstock, David M', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Weigert, Oliver']","['Hellmuth JC', 'Louissaint A Jr', 'Szczepanowski M', 'Haebe S', 'Pastore A', 'Alig S', 'Staiger AM', 'Hartmann S', 'Kridel R', 'Ducar MD', 'Koch P', 'Dreyling M', 'Hansmann ML', 'Ott G', 'Rosenwald A', 'Gascoyne RD', 'Weinstock DM', 'Hiddemann W', 'Klapper W', 'Weigert O']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8409-3037', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3621-4807', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8724-3907', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0987-7373']","['Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology & Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine II-Hematology, Oncology, Hematology Laboratory, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Dr. Margarete Fischer-Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology Stuttgart, and University of Tuebingen, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'University Hospital Muenster, Department of Medicine A, Muenster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Dr. Senckenberg Institute of Pathology, University Hospital of Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus, Stuttgart, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University of Wuerzburg and Comprehensive Cancer Center Mainfranken, Wuerzburg, Germany.', 'Centre for Lymphoid Cancer, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA; and.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematopathology Section and Lymph Node Registry, and.', 'Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'Experimental Leukemia and Lymphoma Research, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180820,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Duodenal Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Microenvironment', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2018/08/22 06:00,2019/07/17 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60675-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-03-837252 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Oct 18;132(16):1695-1702. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-03-837252.

Translocations and deregulation of the MSI2 gene are diagnostic of certain cancers, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) with translocation t(7;17), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with translocation t(10;17), and some cases of B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pB-ALL). To better understand the function of MSI2 in leukemia, the mRNA targets that are bound and regulated by MSI2 and their MSI2-binding motifs need to be identified. To this end, using photoactivatable ribonucleoside cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) and the multiple EM for motif elicitation (MEME) analysis tool, here we identified MSI2's mRNA targets and the consensus RNA-recognition element (RRE) motif recognized by MSI2 (UUAG). Of note, MSI2 knockdown altered the expression of several genes with roles in eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling pathways. We also show that MSI2 regulates classic interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling by promoting the degradation of the mRNA of IL-6 signal transducer (IL6ST or GP130), which, in turn, affected the phosphorylation statuses of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK. In summary, we have identified multiple MSI2-regulated mRNAs and provided evidence that MSI2 controls IL6ST activity that control oncogenic signaling networks. Our findings may help inform strategies for unraveling the role of MSI2 in leukemia to pave the way for the development of targeted therapies.",['(c) 2018 Duggimpudi et al.'],"['Duggimpudi, Sujitha',

We discuss the immense diversity within the Latino community and varying definitions of what is considered Latino, which pose an epidemiological challenge. Environmental factors have been evaluated as possible predisposing factors in the development of ALL but studies have produced conflicting results. In this review we describe chromosomal abnormalities and the specific genomic landscape in Latinos with ALL and their association with unfavorable prognosis, focusing on the higher frequency of Philadelphia chromosome-Like ALL. Recent data suggest an association between polymorphisms that are commonly found in indigenous Americans and high rates of ALL. The review compares the distribution of ALL throughout the various countries in Latin America in an attempt to shed some epidemiological light on the genetic ancestry of ALL.

Although more than ten NPM1 transcripts are known, the reports were usually limited to one predominant transcript. In leukemia, the NPM1 expression has not been widely studied so far. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the mutational status of the gene seems to play a pivotal role in carcinogenesis. Therefore, the aim of the study was to quantify alternative NPM1 transcripts in two types of acute leukemia, AML and ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukemia). METHODS: Using droplet digital PCR, we analyzed the levels of three protein-coding NPM1 transcripts in 66 samples collected from AML and ALL patients and 16 control samples. Using RNA-seq, we detected 8 additional NPM1 transcripts, including non-coding splice variants with retained introns. For data analysis, Welch two sample t-test, Pearson's correlation and Kaplan-Meier analysis were applied. RESULTS: The levels of the particular NPM1 transcripts were significantly different but highly correlated with each other in both leukemia and control samples. Transcript NPM1.1, encoding the longest protein (294 aa), had the highest level of accumulation and was one of the most abundant transcripts in the cell. Comparing to NPM1.1, the levels of the NPM1.2 and NPM1.3 transcripts, encoding a 265-aa and 259-aa proteins, were 30 and 3 times lower, respectively. All three NPM1 transcripts were proportionally upregulated in both types of leukemia compared to control samples. In AML, the levels of NPM1 transcripts decreased in complete remission and increased again with relapse of the disease. Low levels of NPM1.1 and NPM1.3 were associated with better prognosis. The contribution of non-coding transcripts to the total level of NPM1 gene seemed to be marginal, except for one short 5-end transcript accumulated at high levels in AML and control cells. Aberrant proportions of particular NPM1 splice variants could be linked to abnormal expression of genes encoding alternative splicing factors. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of the studied NPM1 transcripts were different but highly correlated with each other. Their upregulation in AML and ALL, decrease after therapy and association with patient outcome suggests the involvement of elevated NPM1 expression in the acute leukemia pathogenesis.",,"['Handschuh, Luiza', 'Wojciechowski, Pawel', 'Kazmierczak, Maciej', 'Marcinkowska-Swojak, Malgorzata', 'Luczak, Magdalena', 'Lewandowski, Krzysztof', 'Komarnicki, Mieczyslaw', 'Blazewicz, Jacek', 'Figlerowicz, Marek', 'Kozlowski, Piotr']","['Handschuh L', 'Wojciechowski P', 'Kazmierczak M', 'Marcinkowska-Swojak M', 'Luczak M', 'Lewandowski K', 'Komarnicki M', 'Blazewicz J', 'Figlerowicz M', 'Kozlowski P']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9803-6877'],"['European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland. luizahan@ibch.poznan.pl.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego 84, 60-569, Poznan, Poland. luizahan@ibch.poznan.pl.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology, Piotrowo 2, 60-965, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego 84, 60-569, Poznan, Poland.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Technology and Chemical Engineering, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego 84, 60-569, Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Szamarzewskiego 84, 60-569, Poznan, Poland.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology, Piotrowo 2, 60-965, Poznan, Poland.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Computing Science, Poznan University of Technology, Piotrowo 2, 60-965, Poznan, Poland.', 'European Centre for Bioinformatics and Genomics, Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry, Polish Academy of Sciences, Noskowskiego 12/14, 61-704, Poznan, Poland.', 'Institute of Technology and Chemical Engineering, Poznan University of Technology, Poznan, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180820,England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Introns', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",PMC6102803,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*Expression', '*NPM1', '*Quantitative transcript analysis', '*Splice variants']",,2018/08/22 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2018/08/22 06:00'],"['2018/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-018-1608-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-018-1608-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2018 Aug 20;16(1):232. doi: 10.1186/s12967-018-1608-2.,1,232,"['2017/01/X/NZ2/01906/Narodowe Centrum Nauki/International', '5536/E-63/SPUB/2017/1/Ministerstwo Nauki i Szkolnictwa Wyzszego/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such genetic aberrations can be recreated experimentally to a large extent, to render normal hematopoietic stem cells ""bad"", analogous to the leukemic stem cells.

The prognosis is poorer in CCSK than in Wilms' tumor, and multimodal treatment including surgery, intensive chemotherapy, and radiation is required to improve the outcome for children with CCSK. Histological evaluation is required for the diagnosis. However, biopsies of tumors to obtain diagnostic specimens are not routinely performed because of the risk of spreading tumor cells during the procedure. Recently, internal tandem duplication (ITD) of BCOR has been recognized as a genetic hallmark of CCSK. We herein established a novel BCOR-ITD-specific polymerase chain reaction method with well-designed primers, and then performed a liquid biopsy for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from plasma of three children with nonmetastatic renal tumors (stage II) and from one control. BCOR-ITD was positively detected in the cfDNA of two cases, both of which were later diagnosed as CCSK based on histological feature of the resected tumor specimen, while it was not detected for a normal control and a patient diagnosed with Wilms' tumor. Our study is the first one of preoperative circulating tumor DNA assay in pediatric renal tumors. The liquid biopsy method enables less invasive, preoperative diagnosis of CCSK with no risk of tumor spillage, which can avoid iatrogenic upstaging.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals,

This increases the risk of misinterpretation of results by both clinicians and patients. An expert panel met to discuss current issues surrounding BCR-ABL1 testing in the UK and to develop guidance for laboratories, with emphasis on the optimal approach to reporting laboratory results. Topics included the minimum required information to include in the laboratory report, units of measurement, test sensitivity and BCR-ABL1 transcript variants. To aid communication between laboratories and clinics, standard forms were generated that could be used by (i) clinics when submitting samples to laboratories, and (ii) laboratories when reporting results to clinics.

Serial PB and LN samples were taken before start and during the first 29 days of treatment. Changes in plasma inflammation-related biomarkers, CLL cell RNA expression, B-cell activation and migration markers expression, and PB mononuclear cell populations were assessed. A significant reduction of 10 plasma inflammation markers, the majority of which were chemokines and not CLL-derived, was observed within hours, and was paralleled by very early increase of CD19(+) circulating cells. At the RNA level, significant and continuous changes in transcription factors and signalling molecules linked to B-cell receptor signalling and CLL biology was observed in both PB and LN CLL cells already after 2 days of treatment.

In this study, we developed and tested cobomarsen (MRG-106), a locked nucleic acid-modified oligonucleotide inhibitor of miR-155. In MF and human lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1+) CTCL cell lines in vitro, inhibition of miR-155 with cobomarsen de-repressed direct miR-155 targets, decreased expression of multiple gene pathways associated with cell survival, reduced survival signalling, decreased cell proliferation and activated apoptosis. We identified a set of genes that are significantly regulated by cobomarsen, including direct and downstream targets of miR-155. Using clinical biopsies from MF patients, we demonstrated that expression of these pharmacodynamic biomarkers is dysregulated in MF and associated with miR-155 expression level and MF lesion severity. Further, we demonstrated that miR-155 simultaneously regulates multiple parallel survival pathways (including JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT) previously associated with the pathogenesis of MF, and that these survival pathways are inhibited by cobomarsen in vitro.

Transgenic approaches further improved in vivo hematological research, allowing the development of human-cytokine-producing mice, which show superior human cell engraftment. The most popular mouse strains used in research, the NOG (NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid) Il2rgamma(tm1Sug)/Jic) and the NSG (NOD/SCID-IL2Rgamma(-/-), NOD.Cg-Prkdc(scid)Il2rgamma(tm1Wjl)/SzJ) mouse, and their human-cytokine-producing (interleukin-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and stem cell factor) counterparts (huNOG and NSGS), rely partly on a mutation in the DNA repair protein PRKDC, causing a severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) phenotype and rendering the mice less tolerant to DNA-damaging therapeutics, thereby limiting their usefulness in the investigation of novel acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapeutics. NRG (NOD/RAG1/2(-/-)IL2Rgamma(-/-)) mice show equivalent immune ablation through a defective recombination activation gene (RAG), leaving DNA damage repair intact, and human-cytokine-producing NRGS (NRG-SGM3) mice were generated, improving myeloid engraftment. Our findings indicate that unconditioned NRG and NRGS mice can harbor established AML CDXs and can tolerate aggressive induction chemotherapy at higher doses than NSG mice without overt toxicity. However, unconditioned NRGS mice developed less clinically relevant disease, with CDXs forming solid tumors throughout the body, whereas unconditioned NRG mice were incapable of efficiently supporting PDX or human hematopoietic stem cell engraftment. These findings emphasize the contextually dependent utility of each of these powerful new strains in the study of normal and malignant human hematopoiesis.

Co-treatment with delphinidin and As(III) resulted in the reduction of IC50 value for As(III) from 11.2 to 1.5muM, which was considered as clinically achieved concentrations of As(III). The combination treatment strongly preferred to selectively enhance the cytotoxicity of As(III) against HL-60cells rather than human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The induction of apoptosis as evidenced by the increase of sub-G1 cells, DNA fragmentation, annexin V-positive cells and the activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3 was observed in HL-60cells co-treated with As(III) and delphinidin. Similar to the activation pattern of caspases, a substantial decrease in the expression level of Bid along with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was also observed. These results suggested that the combination treatment triggered a convergence of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis via the activation of caspase-8 and cleaved Bid. Delphinidin itself significantly decreased the intracellular GSH ([i]GSH) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding activity, and further returned As(III)-triggered increment of [i]GSH and enhancement of NF-kappaB binding activity to control level. Additionally, buthionine sulfoximine, a GSH depletor; JSH-23, a NF-kappaB inhibitor, also mimicked the capacity of delphinidin to significantly induce the reduction of [i]GSH along with the potentiation of As(III) cytotoxicity in HL-60cells. These observations suggested that delphinidin-induced sensitization of HL-60cells to As(III) was caused by the reduction of [i]GSH, which was probably associated with the inhibitory effect of delphinidin on NF-kappaB binding activity. These findings further suggest that delphinidin-induced sensitization of HL-60cells to As(III) may lead to dose reduction of As(III) in clinical application, and ultimately contribute to minimizing its side effects.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, prior childhood cancer survival studies have not formally tested for mediation by socioeconomic status (SES). This study applied mediation methods to quantify the role of SES in racial/ethnic differences in childhood cancer survival. METHODS: This study used population-based cancer survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 database for black, white, and Hispanic children who had been diagnosed at the ages of 0 to 19 years in 2000-2011 (n = 31,866). Black-white and Hispanic-white mortality hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for age, sex, and stage at diagnosis, were estimated. The inverse odds weighting method was used to test for mediation by SES, which was measured with a validated census-tract composite index. RESULTS: Whites had a significant survival advantage over blacks and Hispanics for several childhood cancers. SES significantly mediated the race/ethnicity-survival association for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; SES reduced the original association between race/ethnicity and survival by 44%, 28%, 49%, and 34%, respectively, for blacks versus whites and by 31%, 73%, 48%, and 28%, respectively, for Hispanics versus whites ((log hazard ratio total effect - log hazard ratio direct effect)/log hazard ratio total effect). CONCLUSIONS: SES significantly mediates racial/ethnic childhood cancer survival disparities for several cancers. However, the proportion of the total race/ethnicity-survival association explained by SES varies between black-white and Hispanic-white comparisons for some cancers, and this suggests that mediation by other factors differs across groups.",['(c) 2018 American Cancer Society.'],"['Kehm, Rebecca D', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Poynter, Jenny N', 'Vock, David M', 'Altekruse, Sean F', 'Osypuk, Theresa L']","['Kehm RD', 'Spector LG', 'Poynter JN', 'Vock DM', 'Altekruse SF', 'Osypuk TL']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6089-6799'],"['Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Division of Biostatistics, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Epidemiology Branch, Prevention and Population Sciences Program, Division of Cardiovascular Sciences, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180820,United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age of Onset', 'Cancer Survivors/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', '*Health Status Disparities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*ethnology/*mortality/pathology', 'Racial Groups/ethnology/*statistics & numerical data', 'SEER Program', '*Social Class', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'United States/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6234050,['NOTNLM'],"['*cancer survival', '*childhood cancer', '*mediation', '*racial and ethnic disparities', '*socioeconomic status']",,2018/08/21 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2017/12/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/11 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.31560 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2018 Oct 15;124(20):4090-4097. doi: 10.1002/cncr.31560.

The apoE gene knockout mouse was used as the model of AS and we accelerated the formation of unstable plaques through the combination of carotid artery ligation and high-fat (HF) diet administration (0.2% cholesterol, 20% fat). The mRNA and protein expressions of CLOCK in peripheral blood monouclear cells of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients or mouse AS model were detected by qPCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. The number of adherent cells and atherosclerotic plaques was counted to assess the effects of CLOCK on the progression of ACS, and adherence-associated genes, such as vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL-2), and CCL-5. The results showed that CLOCK expression was significantly increased in both ACS patients and AS mouse model. The levels of CLOCK, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), perilipin 2 (ADFP), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), as well as the number of atherosclerotic plaques were elevated in the AS mouse model, as compared with the control group. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that CLOCK bound directly to the promoter of PAI-1 gene and CLOCK could positively regulate the expressions of LIF, ICAM-1, ADFP, NF-kappaB, and PAI-1. Reduction of CLOCK expression would decrease the expressions of VCAM-1, CCL-2, and CCL-5, and the number of adherent cells and atherosclerotic plaques, but these effects were neutralized when PAI-1 was simultaneously overexpressed in either mouse model or MAECs.

Specifically, NGS has been used to analyze the spectrum of clonal mutations in malignancy. Though far more efficient than traditional Sanger methods, NGS struggles with identifying rare clonal and subclonal mutations due to its high error rate of ~0.5-2.0%. Thus, standard NGS has a limit of detection for mutations that are >0.02 variant allele fraction (VAF). While the clinical significance for mutations this rare in patients without known disease remains unclear, patients treated for leukemia have significantly improved outcomes when residual disease is <0.0001 by flow cytometry. In order to mitigate this artefactual background of NGS, numerous methods have been developed. Here we describe a method for Error-corrected DNA and RNA Sequencing (ECS), which involves tagging individual molecules with both a 16 bp random index for error-correction and an 8 bp patient-specific index for multiplexing. Our method can detect and track clonal mutations at variant allele fractions (VAFs) two orders of magnitude lower than the detection limit of NGS and as rare as 0.0001 VAF.",,"['Wong, Wing H', 'Tong, R Spencer', 'Young, Andrew L', 'Druley, Todd E']","['Wong WH', 'Tong RS', 'Young AL', 'Druley TE']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine; Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine; Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine; Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine; Center for Genome Sciences and Systems Biology, Washington University School of Medicine; druley_t@wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",20180803,United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,"['Genomics/*methods', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods']",PMC6126605,,,,2018/08/21 06:00,2018/10/10 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/57509 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2018 Aug 3;(138). doi: 10.3791/57509.,138,,"['R01 CA049449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA149445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UM1 CA186107/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In this retrospective study, the authors reviewed the clinical and pathological data of 209 patients with OAL treated by the senior author during 2000 to 2017. RESULTS: Of 209 patients with OAL, 65 (31%) had a history of lymphoma. In 54 of the 65 patients (83%), the original lymphoma and OAL were of the same histologic type. In 8 of the 65 patients (12.3%), the OAL was more indolent than the original lymphoma: 6 patients with a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, one of mantle cell lymphoma, and one of grade 3 follicular lymphoma had biopsy-proven extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma in the orbital area. Two additional patients (3%) with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia developed OAL: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in one patient and extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma in the other. One patient (1.5%) with a history of a low-grade follicular lymphoma relapsed as a different low-grade histology of extranodal marginal-zone lymphoma. Lower-grade OAL than the original lymphoma was more common than higher-grade OAL than the original lymphoma (p = 0.048). CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of 209 patients with OAL, the authors found that nearly one third had a history of lymphoma, 17% of whom had a different histologic type of lymphoma in the orbit, more commonly a more indolent type. This underscores the importance of biopsy of OAL even in patients with a known history of lymphoma to determine the histologic subtype of orbital lymphoma and to help guide appropriate treatment.",,"['Sagiv, Oded', 'Thakar, Sudip D', 'Manning, John T', 'Kandl, Thomas J', 'Fayad, Luis E', 'Fowler, Nathan', 'Hagemeister, Fredrick B', 'Fanale, Michelle A', 'Pinnix, Chelsea C', 'Samaniego, Felipe', 'Esmaeli, Bita']","['Sagiv O', 'Thakar SD', 'Manning JT', 'Kandl TJ', 'Fayad LE', 'Fowler N', 'Hagemeister FB', 'Fanale MA', 'Pinnix CC', 'Samaniego F', 'Esmaeli B']",,"['Orbital Oncology and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery, Department of Plastic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Orbital Oncology and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery, Department of Plastic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Orbital Oncology and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery, Department of Plastic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.', 'Orbital Oncology and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery, Department of Plastic Surgery, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, U.S.A.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg,Ophthalmic plastic and reconstructive surgery,8508431,['Orbital lymphoma'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasm Staging', 'Orbital Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States/epidemiology']",,,,,2018/08/21 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/IOP.0000000000001215 [doi]'],ppublish,Ophthalmic Plast Reconstr Surg. 2019 May/Jun;35(3):243-246. doi: 10.1097/IOP.0000000000001215.,3,243-246,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Physical activity (PA) is essential for development and may influence symptom severity. Children with leukemia are at risk of cognitive impairments from central nervous system therapies. Using a longitudinal parallel-process model, relationships among function and symptom clusters were explored. OBJECTIVE: This study examined the longitudinal mediation effects of PA on cognition via a symptom cluster during leukemia treatment. METHODS: Symptoms, PA, and cognitive function of 327 children aged 3 to 18 years were measured over 4 intervals during the first year of leukemia treatment. Children 7 years or older self-reported and parents reported for younger children. Parents completed cognitive function measurements for all children. The influence of the first time point and the subsequent change between all 4 time points of PA on the symptom cluster were explored. Analysis determined whether the symptom cluster mediated the effect of cognition over the treatment period. RESULTS: Patients with a higher PA at time 1 reduced their symptom cluster severity over the measurements. However, when PA increased over the measurements, symptom cluster severity also increased. When the symptom cluster was more severe at time 1, cognitive function was lower at time 1, and cognitive function decreased over time. When symptoms became more severe over time, cognitive function declined. CONCLUSIONS: The symptom cluster acted as a mediator between PA and cognition.

Recently, aging has been linked with the development of age-related clonal hematopoiesis (ARCH), defined as the gradual clonal expansion of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) carrying recurrent disruptive genetic variants in individuals without a diagnosis of hematologic malignancy. Here we will review the implications of ARCH in the context of HSCT. RECENT FINDINGS: ARCH is highly prevalent in the general population and commonly involves genes that are recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies. Nevertheless, the vast majority of individuals with ARCH will not develop overt hematologic disease in their lifetime. The presence of ARCH may increase the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) in individuals undergoing autologous HSCT. In the setting of allogeneic HSCT, ARCH present in the donor may contribute to adverse outcomes such as unexplained cytopenias posttransplant and donor cell leukemia. SUMMARY: A better understanding of the hematopoietic milieu of HSCT recipients and of the importance of ARCH in the context of the replicative pressures imposed on transplanted HSPCs is needed in order to optimize conditioning regimens, donor selection and clinical outcomes post-HSCT.",,"['Abelson, Sagi', 'Wang, Jean C Y']","['Abelson S', 'Wang JCY']",,"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN).', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network (UHN).', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, UHN.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",,United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans']",,,,,2018/08/21 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/MOH.0000000000000465 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2018 Nov;25(6):441-445. doi: 10.1097/MOH.0000000000000465.,6,441-445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aptamer~A/PAMs are small, anionic, stable nanoparticles capable of delivering a large mass percentage peptide amphiphile (PA) compared to targeting DNA components. Aptamer~A/PAMs are stable for over 4 h in the presence of biological fluids. Additionally, the aptamer retains its cell-targeting properties when annealed to the A/PAM, thus leading to enhanced delivery to a specifically-targeted B-cell leukemia cell line.

However, alternative splicing variants have been recently proposed as mechanisms of TKI resistance, although the clinical significance of these mutations remains controversial. We here present the long-term clinical courses of three CML patients harboring such unique mutations and try to assess their clinical significances. Moreover, the exon 6 frameshift presented here has been rarely reported, which may provide important information on this rare mutation. Clinical presentation: We report three cases of CML harboring an exon 7 deletion, insertion of 35 intronic nucleotides and an exon 6 frameshift, respectively. Remarkably, all patients obtained better than molecular response(4.0) following administration of TKIs. Discussion and conclusion: Three CML cases highlighted an association between such splicing variants and clinical outcomes. The premature termination in the kinase domain due to these mutations likely causes conformational changes and inhibits TKI binding, but it also results in abrogating kinase activities of CML cells. Thus, the above-mentioned mutants might less affect outcomes of treatment. Noteworthy, clinically available International Scale RT-PCR system cannot distinguish kinase-active mutants from kinase-inactive mutants, which may possibly influence upon interpretation of the treatment efficacy. Clonal quantification on respective mutants could more precisely evaluate CML status in these patients. Therefore, one should realize these important splicing variants and accumulate further experiences.",,"['Ishida, Takashi', 'Miyazaki, Koji', 'Okina, Sosei', 'Miyata, Tomomi', 'Hayama, Kei', 'Higashihara, Masaaki', 'Suzuki, Takahiro']","['Ishida T', 'Miyazaki K', 'Okina S', 'Miyata T', 'Hayama K', 'Higashihara M', 'Suzuki T']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9429-1763'],"['a Department of Transfusion and Cell Transplantation , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'a Department of Transfusion and Cell Transplantation , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.', 'b Department of Hematology , Kitasato University School of Medicine , Kanagawa , Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180820,England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Alternative Splicing', 'Female', '*Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/blood/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Exon 7 deletion', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'exon 6 frameshift', 'insertion of 35 intronic nucleotides', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2018/08/21 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10245332.2018.1507883 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):49-51. doi: 10.1080/10245332.2018.1507883.

In this study, IVT and SSCs homing on seminiferous tubules of host testis in organ culture have been studied. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, human SSCs were isolated and their identities were confirmed by tracking their promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) protein. These cells were transplanted to adult azoospermia mouse testes using two methods, namely, IVT and in vivo transplantation as transplantation groups, and testes without transplantation of cells were assigned in the control group. Then histomorphometric, immunohistochemical and molecular studies were done after 2 weeks. Results: After two weeks, histomorphometric studies revealed that the number of subsided spermatogonial cells (SCs) and the percentage of tubules with subsided SCs in IVT and in vivo groups were significantly more than those in the control group (P<0.05). Immunohistochemical studies in the transplantation groups confirmed that the PLZF protein was expressed in the cells subsided on the seminiferous tubule. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) demonstrated that the PLZF gene expression was only positive in the transplantation groups, but it was not significantly different between the IVT group and the in vivo group (P>0.05). Conclusion: Testicular tissue culture conditions after SSC transplantation can help these cells subside on the seminiferous tubule basement membrane.",['Copyright(c) by Royan Institute.

We have previously reported that the ability of BMSCs derived from CMML patients (CMML-BMSCs) in supporting the expansion of cord blood (CB) CD34(+) cells was significantly reduced compared to BMSCs derived from healthy donors (HD-BMSCs). In addition, CMML-BMSCs led to a skewed differentiation of CB CD34(+) cells favoring myeloid lineage compared with HD-BMSCs. To assess whether the altered cytokine secretion was one of the mechanisms to mediate the impaired hematopoietic supportive activity of CMML-BMSCs, a transwell coculture followed by cytokine array was performed. We showed that noncontacted coculture with CMML-BMSCs preferentially promoted the differentiation of CB CD34(+) cells toward myeloid lineage. The expression levels of multiple cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, and GRO-beta) were markedly reduced in CMML-BMSCs compared with HD-BMSCs. By supplementing IL-6, IL-8, or GRO-beta, the hematopoietic supportive activity of CMML-BMSCs was partially restored.

Trivalent arsenic derivatives (arsenite, As(III)) with remarkable clinical efficacy in acute promyelocytic leukemia has been demonstrated to exhibit inhibitory effect against breast cancer cells. To provide novel insight into the development of new therapeutic strategies, antitumor activity of As(III) and tetrandrine (Tetra), a Chinese plant-derived alkaloid, against the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 in vitro and in vivo was investigated. Methods: Cytotoxicity was evaluated using cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase leakage and cell cycle assay. Alterations of genes related to cell proliferation and death were analyzed using western blotting. In vivo antitumor activity of As(III) alone or in combination with Tetra was studied using MDA-MB-231 xenografts in nude mice. Results: Synergistic cytotoxic effects of two drugs were observed in the cells. In vivo study also showed that co-administration of As(III) and Tetra significantly reduced tumor volume and weight, directly supporting its in vitro antitumor activity. No deaths and reduction of body-weight were observed after a long-term co-administration, indicating its good tolerability. S-phase arrest associated with the upregulation of FOXO3a, p27 along with decreased Cyclin D1 expression was observed in the cells treated with the combined regimen. A substantial upregulated p21 expression and downregulated phospho-FOXO3a and Cyclin D1 expression was observed in the tumor tissues of mice co-administered with As(III) and Tetra. Autophagy induction was observed in the combination treatment in vitro and in vivo. The addition of wortmannin, a potent autophagy inhibitor, significantly rescued MDA-MB-231 cells from their cytotoxicity of As(III) and Tetra. Conclusions: S-phase arrest, autophagic and necrotic cell death contribute to the cytocidal effects of the combined regimen of As(III) and Tetra. Considering our previous study showing synergistic cytotoxic effects of the combined regimen in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cell line MCF-7, these results suggest that development of the combination regimen of As(III) plus Tetra may offer many benefits to patients with different types of breast cancer.",,"['Yuan, Bo', 'Yao, Mingjiang', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Sato, Ai', 'Okazaki, Ayane', 'Komuro, Hana', 'Hayashi, Hideki', 'Toyoda, Hiroo', 'Pei, Xiaohua', 'Hu, Xiaomei', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Takagi, Norio']","['Yuan B', 'Yao M', 'Wang X', 'Sato A', 'Okazaki A', 'Komuro H', 'Hayashi H', 'Toyoda H', 'Pei X', 'Hu X', 'Hirano T', 'Takagi N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3406-258X'],"['1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '2Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', ""3XiYuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100091 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 0632 3409grid.410318.f"", '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '2Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '2Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', ""4The Third Affiliated Hospital of Beijing University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, 100029 People's Republic of China.0000 0001 1431 9176grid.24695.3c"", ""3XiYuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Beijing, 100091 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 0632 3409grid.410318.f"", '5Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f', '1Department of Applied Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392 Japan.0000 0001 0659 6325grid.410785.f']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180813,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6090820,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenite', 'Cell death', 'Combination therapy', 'MDA-MB-231 cells', 'Tetrandrine']",,2018/08/21 06:00,2018/08/21 06:01,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-018-0613-0 [doi]', '613 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2018 Aug 13;18:113. doi: 10.1186/s12935-018-0613-0. eCollection 2018.,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNMT3A mutations are negative prognostic factors, while NPM1 mutations are low-risk factors and inclined to concurrently appear with DNMT3A mutations. In this study, we aimed to find out how NPM1 mutations affect patients' outcomes in the background of DNMT3A mutations. Patients and methods: We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and found 51 AML patients with DNMT3A mutations. Of them, 28 patients had a combination of NPM1 mutations. Results: In all, NPM1 had the highest mutation frequency (n=28, 54.9%). DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(mut) patients had higher bone marrow (BM) blasts (P=0.015), higher FLT3-ITD/TKD rate (P=0.004), and lower IDH2 mutation rate (P=0.014) than the DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(wild) patients, while their prognoses were the same as the DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(wild) patients (P>0.1). All 51 patients benefited from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) treatment (P=0.005 and 0.001 for event-free survival [EFS] and overall survival [OS], respectively). In the 23 patients with DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(wild), those who received HSCT had prolonged EFS and OS (P=0.043 and 0.008, respectively), while HSCT treatment did not produce a positive impact on EFS and OS in the remaining 28 patients with DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(mut) (P=0.056 and 0.053, respectively). Conclusion: Our study found that NPM1 mutations influenced BM blasts' percentage, FLT3-ITD/TKD rate, and IDH2 mutation rate in AML patients with DNMT3A mutations but made little difference to the overall prognosis. While HSCT treatments benefited all DNMT3A(mut) patients, it was better for DNMT3A(mut)/NPM1(wild) patients to extend their EFS and OS.",,"['Yang, Xinrui', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Zhang, Xinpei', 'Zhang, Gaoqi', 'Zhang, Jilei', 'Yang, Siyuan', 'Wang, Jing', 'Ke, Xiaoyan', 'Fu, Lin']","['Yang X', 'Shi J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang G', 'Zhang J', 'Yang S', 'Wang J', 'Ke X', 'Fu L']",,"['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China, fulin022@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180807,New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,PMC6086113,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNA methyltransferases 3A', 'next-generation sequencing', 'nucleophosmin 1', 'prognosis']",['Disclosure The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],2018/08/21 06:00,2018/08/21 06:01,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/21 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S166714 [doi]', 'cmar-10-2489 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2018 Aug 7;10:2489-2497. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S166714. eCollection 2018.,,2489-2497,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another common gene involved in AML is IDH1/2. However, the influence of IDH1/2 mutations on outcomes in DNMT3A-mutated patients remains unknown. This study aims to determine the effect of IDH1/2(mut) on the prognosis in patients with DNMT3A-mutated AML. Patients and methods: We screened patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database and selected 51 patients with AML and the DNMT3A mutation, among which 16 patients (31.4%) had both DNMT3A and IDH1/2(mut). Results: Among our sample, 11 cases had the IDH1 mutation (21.7%), and 5 cases had the IDH2 mutation (9.8%). Patients in the DNMT3A(mut)IDH1/2(wild) group showed a greater number of NPM1 mutation (P=0.022), and higher event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (P=0.010 and P=0.007, respectively). Patients in the DNMT3A(mut)IDH1/2(mut) group showed no increase in EFS or OS after HSCT or chemotherapy. Other factors, like white blood cells, bone marrow blasts, peripheral blood blasts, and mutated recurrent gene numbers had no significant influence on EFS and OS. Conclusion: The IDH1/2 gene had little influence on the prognosis of patients with the DNMT3A mutation.

Increased expression of specific purinergic receptors is reported in asthma. The role of purinergic P2Y6 receptors (P2Y6R) in asthma is controversial. Hypothesis: P2Y6R activation in asthma improves pulmonary function and reduces inflammation and smooth muscle amount. Methods: Female mice (C57/BL6, age 30 days) were randomly assigned to receive intranasal house dust mite (HDM) antigen (40 or 80 microg) or saline, 5 days/week, for 6 weeks. Randomly selected subgroups received intraperitoneal P2Y6R agonist prodrug (GC021109; 10 or 100 microg/kg weight/dose) simultaneously with HDM. After 6 weeks, lung function was measured. Lung lavage fluid (LLF) was used to measure total cell count, total protein, and cytokines. Immunohistochemistry for alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was done. Airway wall thickness was measured on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) images. Results: Pulmonary function testing revealed a HDM dose-dependent airway hyperresponsiveness. Airway resistance was increased 2-fold while compliance was decreased by 50% at the higher HDM dose (P<0.05). GC021109 prevented these changes. HDM-exposed mice had elevated inflammatory cell and total protein levels in LLF which were prevented by GC021109 (P<0.05). HDM mice also had elevated LLF levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-12, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, chemokine (C-X-C) motif ligand 1, and leukemia inhibitory factor that were reduced by GC021109 with a dose-dependent pattern. HDM mice had increased peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration and increased alpha-SMA; these changes were absent with GC021109. Airway wall thickness measured on micro-CT images was increased after HDM exposure and significantly reduced by GC021109 treatment. Conclusion: The P2Y6R prodrug GC021109 inhibited allergen-induced changes in pulmonary function, inflammatory responses, and airway and vascular smooth muscle mass.

The diagnostic accuracy of subjective adherence measures using electronic monitoring (EM) as the reference standard is yet to be determined. This study aimed to evaluate correlates of TKI NA using EM and test the diagnostic accuracy of subjective adherence measures. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CML patients receiving a TKI for any duration were enrolled at 4 hematology institutes, and adherence was measured for 4 months. EM adherence was the reference adherence measure, expressed as the percentage of days with the drug taken as prescribed. Subjective adherence was measured using the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale (BAASIS) self-report and clinician-reported visual analog scale (VAS) at 2 time points. Baseline theory-derived correlates of NA were identified using single and multiple regression analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of BAASIS and clinician-reported VAS was tested against an exploratory EM NA cutoff of < 95%. RESULTS: The median EM adherence (n = 55) was 97.5% (range, 48-100%), while the 25th percentile was 92.1%. Lack of membership in a CML patient support group, living alone, and third-line treatment were associated with EM NA on multiple regression analysis. The BAASIS self-report (n = 94) had a sensitivity of 67% and a specificity of 71% for diagnosing NA, while clinician-reported VAS (n = 89) had a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 42%. CONCLUSION: A quarter of patients had potentially clinically meaningful NA. These NA correlates and the BAASIS provide a basis for identifying nonadherent patients who can be targeted by interventions.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of the combination in patients with relapsed or refractory MCL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present multicenter, nonrandomized phase II trial used a Simon 2-stage design with 3 cohorts: cohort A, MCL with no previous bortezomib (including untreated MCL); cohort B, MCL with previous bortezomib; and cohort C, relapsed or refractory DLBCL with no previous bortezomib. Vorinostat (400 mg) was administered orally on days 1 to 5 and 8 to 12 before bortezomib (1.3 mg/m(2)), which was administered intravenously on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of each 21-day cycle. RESULTS: For the 65 treated patients (22 in cohort A, 4 in cohort B, and 39 in cohort C), the overall response rate was 31.8%, 0%, and 7.7%, respectively. The median progression-free survival was 7.6 months for cohort A and 1.8 months for cohort C. In cohort A, 7 patients had a partial response (PRs), 5 had stable disease (SD), 7 had progressive disease (PD), 1 was not assessed, and 2 were not evaluable. In cohort B, 2 had SD and 2 had PD. In cohort C, 3 had a PR, 8 had SD, 23 had PD, and 5 were not assessed. Baseline NF-kappaB activation, measured as nuclear RelA by immunohistochemistry, did not correlate with clinical response.

This analysis estimated HRU and costs among newly diagnosed AML patients in a US commercially insured population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective observational study using the IMS Health PharMetrics Plus and Hospital Charge Detail Master databases. Patients included adults who were newly diagnosed with AML between January 2007 and June 2016 (""study period""). Patients with <12 months of continuous enrollment prior to the index date were excluded, as were those whose first diagnosis was AML in remission/relapse, those diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia, those on Medicare supplemental insurance, or those with a diagnosis of AML in remission/relapse without evidence of treatment during the study period. Patients were stratified by receipt of AML treatment (chemotherapy/hematopoietic cell transplantation [HCT]), and their follow-up was partitioned into initial, remission, and relapsed health states. Mean HRU and costs were tallied by treatment and, for treated patients, by health state and time since entry into health state (</=6 vs >6 months). RESULTS: A total of 9,455 patients met study criteria, including 6,415 (68%) treated and 3,040 (32%) untreated patients, with mean follow-up of 18.3 and 16.4 months, respectively. Mean age was 55 years in treated patients and 60 years in untreated patients. Mean total costs per patient were $386,077 in treated patients and $79,382 in untreated patients. For treated patients, 60% of total costs ($231,867 per patient) were incurred during the initial health state, representing time without remission/relapse. Mean monthly total healthcare costs were $21,055 and $4,854 among treated and untreated patients, respectively. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: HRU and costs of managing AML patients are substantial. In treated patients, the majority of costs were incurred during the initial treatment period, without claims indicating remission/relapse.",,"['Hagiwara, May', 'Sharma, Arati', 'Chung, Karen C', 'Delea, Thomas E']","['Hagiwara M', 'Sharma A', 'Chung KC', 'Delea TE']",,"['a PAI , Brookline , MA , USA.', 'a PAI , Brookline , MA , USA.', 'b Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Inc. , Palo Alto , CA , USA.', 'a PAI , Brookline , MA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",20180912,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data', 'Health Resources/economics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*economics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Econometric', 'Patient Acceptance of Health Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'I00', 'I13', 'costs', 'healthcare resource utilization', 'newly diagnosed']",,2018/08/21 06:00,2019/02/27 06:00,['2018/08/21 06:00'],"['2018/08/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2018.1513847 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Nov;21(11):1119-1130. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1513847.

Methods: The clinical characteristics, reproductive outcomes and disease status of the patients who stopped TKI due to pregnancy between November 2004 to November 2017 were retrospectively collected. Results: A total of 14 CML patients in chronic phase (CML-CP), 12 patients were Sokal-low-risk. The median time of TKI treatment was 46.5 (15-123) months before the drug was stopped. The median age at the time of pregnancy was 29 (24-32) years. The median time of TKI exposure was 4 (0-9) weeks in 12 accidental pregnancies. Outcomes were available for 13 pregnancies, 9 cases (69.2%) delivered healthy babies, 1 case (7.7%) delivered polydactylia malformation baby, 3 cases (23.1%) had spontaneous abortion. The last one was still in pregnancy (no organ malformations were observed in color Doppler ultrasound).

Exercise as a countermeasure has been investigated in few studies confirming its feasibility and safety during intensive induction chemotherapy, but the relative effects of diverse exercise programs have not been analyzed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate independent effects of endurance and resistance training on physical capacity and quality of life (QOL). METHODS: Twenty-nine adult AL patients were randomly allocated to an endurance (EG), resistance (RG), or control (CG) group. The intervention took place during induction chemotherapy with three exercise sessions per week for 30-45 min each. Endurance capacity at individual anaerobic threshold, maximum knee extension and flexion strength, standardized phase angle (SPA), and QOL were measured at baseline prior to induction chemotherapy and before discharge. RESULTS: Endurance capacity changed in neither the EG, RG, or CG (P = 0.104); descriptively, the EG (- 0.05 W/kg) and RG (- 0.04 W/kg) exhibited a smaller decrease than CG (- 0.22 W/kg). We noted a significant difference in knee extension strength (P = 0.002); RG improved their maximum strength (+ 0.14 Nm/kg), while the EG's (- 0.13 Nm/kg) and CG's (- 0.19 Nm/kg) was significantly reduced. QOL and SPA revealed no change after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that resistance training is a key component when exercising during induction chemotherapy: it improved maximum strength, but also influenced endurance capacity even during intensive treatment. Considering the prognostic value of physical function, we strongly propose integrating exercise, especially resistance-based training, already during induction chemotherapy to preserve AL patients' physical capacity and functional status.",,"['Wehrle, Anja', 'Kneis, Sarah', 'Dickhuth, Hans-Hermann', 'Gollhofer, Albert', 'Bertz, Hartmut']","['Wehrle A', 'Kneis S', 'Dickhuth HH', 'Gollhofer A', 'Bertz H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2436-7782'],"['Institute for Exercise- and Occupational Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. anja.wehrle@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'Department of Medicine I (Specialties: Hematology, Oncology, and Stem-Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Exercise- and Occupational Medicine, Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Sport and Sport Science, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I (Specialties: Hematology, Oncology, and Stem-Cell Transplantation), Medical Center - University of Freiburg, Faculty of Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",20180818,Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,,IM,"['Adult', '*Endurance Training', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Muscle Strength', 'Physical Endurance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Quality of Life', '*Resistance Training', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Exercise therapy', 'Hematologic neoplasms', 'Hospitalization', 'Muscle strength', 'Physical endurance', 'Quality of life']",,2018/08/20 06:00,2019/03/16 06:00,['2018/08/20 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00520-018-4396-6 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-018-4396-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2019 Mar;27(3):1071-1079. doi: 10.1007/s00520-018-4396-6.

We present the case of a 20-year-old patient with a relapse of Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL B-common over 2 years after HCT with no response to salvage chemotherapy or blinatumomab, who finally responded to a molecularly tailored therapy adjusted to the BCR-ABL1-like phenotype. METHODS: The BCR-ABL1-like phenotype was diagnosed on the basis of an increased expression of ABL1 and CRLF2 genes. RESULTS: We combined a nilotinib-based therapy targeting the overexpressed ABL1 gene with a proteasome inhibitor and Peg-asparaginase, achieving a spectacular response: the percentage of lymphoblasts in the bone marrow was reduced from 70% to 5%, which enabled a second HCT to be performed. Moreover, the relatively low toxicity of the treatment led to a good quality of life and no need for prolonged hospitalization. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, this is the first successful use of nilotinib in BCR-ABL1-like phenotype ALL. This case should encourage routine clinical use of molecular data to individualize therapies targeting the overexpressed pathways responsible for leukemic cell proliferation, as a means to overcome chemoresistance.","['(c) 2018 S.

METHODS: Primary preadipocytes derived from bovine IMF tissue were isolated and used as the in vitro cell model. An adenovirus Ad-ZBTB16 was transfected into bovine preadipocytes to overexpress the ZBTB16 gene. By using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blotting, Oil Red-O staining, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity assay, and cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) test, adipogenic and proliferative signals in adipocytes were monitored to investigate effects of ZBTB16 on adipogenesis of bovine preadipocytes. RESULTS: After transfection, mRNA and protein levels of ZBTB16 gene were significantly increased. Enhanced ZBTB16 significantly promoted preadipocyte differentiation, as evidenced by accelerated lipid accumulation, enhanced GPDH activity, consistently increased mRNA expressions of adipogenic key transcription factors PPARgamma, C/EBPalpha, FABP4, and ADIPOQ, and markedly increased protein expressions of PPARgamma and FABP4. No difference was observed concerning proliferation of preadipocytes after treatment with Ad-ZBTB16. Furthermore, relative mRNA levels of brown adipocyte selective genes (PRDM16, UCP1, Cidea, Cox8b, and PGC-1alpha) and beige adipocyte selective genes (CD137, TMEM26, and Tbx1) as well as UCP1 protein expression were significantly increased by Ad-ZBTB16. Meanwhile, Ad-ZBTB16 treatment remarkably induced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number in bovine adipocytes. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ZBTB16 overexpression can promote white adipogenesis and induce brown-like adipocyte formation for bovine white intramuscular preadipocytes.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Here, we showed that the pharmacological inhibition and genetic deletion of p53 in proximal tubular cells can attenuate renal dysfunction, tubular epithelial disruption, and interstitial fibrosis in db/db and STZ-induced diabetic nephrology (DN) mice. In human renal proximal tubule (human kidney 2 [HK-2]) cells, inhibition of p53 by PIF reduced the high glucose (HG)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation and reversed the inhibitory effect of HG on mRNA expression levels of lncRNA zinc finger E-box binding homeobox1-antisense RNA 1 (ZEB1-AS1) and ZEB1. Interestingly, our results demonstrated that both lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 and ZEB1 exhibited an anti-fibrotic role, while ZEB1 is positively regulated by lncRNA ZEB1-AS1 during HG treatment. Mechanistically, lnc ZEB1-AS1 bound directly to H3K4 methyltransferase myeloid and lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) and promoted H3K4me3 histone modification on ZEB1 promoter, which was reduced by HG treatment. ChIP analysis indicated the binding of p53 to the promoter region of lnc ZEB1-AS1. Furthermore, the findings were verified by the kidney biopsy samples from patients with DN. Taken all together, our results suggest that p53 may be a therapeutic target for renal fibrosis in DN.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Several derivatives showed promising anti-cancer activity, affording growth inhibition (GI50) values in the nanomolar range (GI50=0.02-0.99muM). Lead compound 7h exhibited EC50 values of 400nM and 700nM, respectively, against two AML clinical specimens. Compound 7h was significantly more potent than parthenolide as an inhibitor of p65 phosphorylation in both hematological and solid tumor cell lines, indicating its ability to inhibit the NF-kappaB pathway. In TMD-231 breast cancer cells, treatment with 7h reduced DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB through inhibition of IKK-beta mediated p65 phosphorylation and caused elevation of basal IkappaBalpha levels through inhibition of constitutive IkappaBalpha turnover and NF-kappaB activation. Molecular docking and dynamic modeling studies indicated that 7h interacts with the kinase domain of the monomeric IKKbeta subunit, leading to inhibition of IKKbeta activation, and compromising phosphorylation of downstream targets of the NF-kappaB pathway; dynamic modeling studies show that this interaction also causes unwinding of the alpha-helix of the NEMO binding site on IKKbeta. Molecular docking studies with 10, a water-soluble analog of 7h, demonstrate that this analog interacts with the dimerization/oligomerization domain of monomeric IKKbeta and may inhibit oligomer formation and subsequent autophosphorylation. Sesquiterpene lactones 7h and 10 are considered ideal candidates for potential clinical development.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

ADCs deliver a toxic moiety into antigen-expressing tumor cells, but may also injure hepatic sinusoids (sinusoidal obstruction syndrome; SOS). We studied patients who received an anti-CD22/calicheamicin conjugate (inotuzumab ozogamicin; InO) to gain insight into mechanisms of sinusoidal injury, given that there are no CD22(+) cells in the normal liver, but nonspecific uptake of ADCs by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs). Six hundred thirty-eight patients (307 with acute lymphocytic leukemia [ALL], 311 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma [NHL]) were randomized to either InO or standard chemotherapy (controls). While blinded to treatment assignment, we reviewed all cases with hepatobiliary complications to adjudicate the causes. Frequency of SOS among patients who received InO was 5 of 328 (1.5%), compared to no cases among 310 control patients. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) developed in 26 (7.9%) InO recipients and 3 (1%) controls. Intrahepatic cholestasis (IHC) was observed in 4.9% of InO recipients and in 5.5% of controls. Subsequent to the randomization study, 113 patients with ALL underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT); frequency of SOS in those previously exposed to InO was 21 of 79 (27%) versus 3 of 34 (9%) in controls. An exploratory multivariate model identified a past history of liver disease and thrombocytopenia before conditioning therapy as dominant risk factors for SOS after transplant. Conclusion: Frequencies of SOS and DILI after inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment were 1.5% and 7.9%, respectively, compared to none and 1% among controls who received standard chemotherapy. These data suggest that ADCs that do not target antigens present in the normal liver have a relatively low frequency of SOS, but a relatively high frequency of DILI.",['(c) 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.'],"['McDonald, George B', 'Freston, James W', 'Boyer, James L', 'DeLeve, Laurie D']","['McDonald GB', 'Freston JW', 'Boyer JL', 'DeLeve LD']",,"['University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington, CT.', 'Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase III', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20190118,United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', 'P93RUU11P7 (Inotuzumab Ozogamicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*adverse effects', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/*etiology', 'Gastroenterologists', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatic Veno-Occlusive Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Inotuzumab Ozogamicin/*adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",PMC6351187,,,,2018/08/19 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2018/08/19 06:00'],"['2018/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hep.30222 [doi]'],ppublish,Hepatology. 2019 Feb;69(2):831-844. doi: 10.1002/hep.30222.

We review the current evidence for CAR-T cell therapy in ALL, associated toxicities, and efforts to improve durable response to therapy. RECENT FINDINGS: CD19-directed CAR-T cells have recently been approved by the FDA for use in children and young adults with ALL and in adults with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in the relapsed/refractory setting. CD22-directed CAR-T cells have shown efficacy against leukemia as well in a recent clinical trial, representing the first alternative CAR target to approach comparable efficacy to CD19 CAR-T cells. Standardization of toxicity grading and management, strategies to combat significant relapse rates after CAR-T therapy, and applicability of CAR-T cells to treat central nervous system (CNS) disease remain challenges in the field and represent priorities for continued research. CAR-T cells are a feasible, effective, and rapidly evolving therapy for patients with relapsed and refractory B cell malignancies.",,"['Pehlivan, Katherine C', 'Duncan, Brynn B', 'Lee, Daniel W']","['Pehlivan KC', 'Duncan BB', 'Lee DW']",,"['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Virginia, PO Box 800386, Charlottesville, VA, 22908, USA.

Here we provide evidence that hyper-activation of DNA ligase III (LIG3) is crucial for genomic instability and survival of MM cells. LIG3 mRNA expression in MM patients correlates with shorter survival and even increases with more advanced stage of disease. Knockdown of LIG3 impairs MM cells viability in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that neoplastic plasmacells are dependent on LIG3-driven repair. To investigate the mechanisms involved in LIG3 expression, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation. We identified miR-22-3p as effective negative regulator of LIG3 in MM. Enforced expression of miR-22 in MM cells downregulated LIG3 protein, which in turn increased DNA damage inhibiting in vitro and in vivo cell growth. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that myeloma cells are addicted to LIG3, which can be effectively inhibited by miR-22, promoting a novel axis of genome stability regulation.",,"['Caracciolo, Daniele', 'Di Martino, Maria Teresa', 'Amodio, Nicola', 'Morelli, Eugenio', 'Montesano, Martina', 'Botta, Cirino', 'Scionti, Francesca', 'Talarico, Daniela', 'Altomare, Emanuela', 'Gallo Cantafio, Maria Eugenia', 'Zuccala, Valeria', 'Maltese, Lorenza', 'Todoerti, Katia', 'Rossi, Marco', 'Arbitrio, Mariamena', 'Neri, Antonino', 'Tagliaferri, Pierosandro', 'Tassone, Pierfrancesco']","['Caracciolo D', 'Di Martino MT', 'Amodio N', 'Morelli E', 'Montesano M', 'Botta C', 'Scionti F', 'Talarico D', 'Altomare E', 'Gallo Cantafio ME', 'Zuccala V', 'Maltese L', 'Todoerti K', 'Rossi M', 'Arbitrio M', 'Neri A', 'Tagliaferri P', 'Tassone P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1522-4504'],"['Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Pathology Unit, Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, and Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Oncology and Hemato-oncology, University of Milan, and Hematology, Fondazione Ca Granda IRCCS Policlinico, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Magna Graecia University, Campus Salvatore Venuta, Catanzaro, Italy. tassone@unicz.it.', 'Sbarro Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Medicine, Center for Biotechnology, College of Science and Technology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA, USA. tassone@unicz.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180817,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MIRN22 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (DNA Ligase ATP)', 'EC 6.5.1.1 (LIG3 protein, human)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Ligase ATP/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Repair', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6365379,,,,2018/08/19 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/08/19 06:00'],"['2018/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0238-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0238-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):487-498. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0238-2.

Although second generation TKIs like dasatinib proved more efficient in achieving molecular remission compared to first generation TKI imatinib, it is unclear how individual responses differ between the drugs and whether mechanisms of drug action can be deduced from the dynamic data. We use time courses from the DASISION trial to address statistical differences in the dynamic response between first line imatinib vs. dasatinib treatment cohorts and we analyze differences between the cohorts by fitting an established mathematical model of functional CML treatment to individual time courses. On average, dasatinib-treated patients show a steeper initial response, while the long-term response only marginally differed between the treatments. Supplementing each patient time course with a corresponding confidence region, we illustrate the consequences of the uncertainty estimate for the underlying mechanisms of CML remission.

However, concerns regarding rare but serious long-term toxicities including cardiotoxicity and hematologic malignancies have driven interest in alternative adjuvant therapy options with more favorable toxicity profiles. This article provides an update of data that help inform clinicians of the role anthracyclines should play in adjuvant breast cancer therapy. Two recently reported large randomized trials-the Anthracycline in Early Breast Cancer and Western German Study Plan B studies-compared a taxane and cyclophosphamide regimen with an anthracycline, taxane, and cyclophosphamide regimen. Although the studies had conflicting results, together these studies suggest that the benefit of adjuvant anthracycline therapy over a nonanthracycline taxane-containing regimen is modest at best and may be primarily seen in patients with especially high-risk disease (i.e., triple-negative breast cancer, involvement of multiple lymph nodes). A third study-the MINDACT study-compared an anthracycline-based regimen to a nonanthracycline regimen, with similar outcomes in both groups. Despite the toxicities, no adjuvant breast cancer regimen has been shown to be superior to an anthracycline-taxane regimen in high-risk patients. These data can directly inform clinical decision-making in determining which patients warrant use of adjuvant anthracycline therapy. Future research may focus on confirming subgroups for whom it is reasonable to forgo adjuvant anthracyclines and validating predictive biomarkers or scores for anthracycline benefit. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In patients with early breast cancer, the choice of adjuvant chemotherapy should be based on its effectiveness in reducing breast cancer recurrences and its short- and long-term toxicities. Although adjuvant anthracycline and taxane chemotherapy has the most data supporting its effectiveness, anthracyclines carry a small but important increased risk for cardiotoxicity and leukemia. Two recent clinical trials help describe the degree of benefit with adjuvant anthracycline therapy compared with taxane therapy alone. They suggest that in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and limited lymph node involvement, nonanthracycline taxane-based adjuvant therapy may be adequate.",['(c) AlphaMed Press 2018.'],"['Shah, Ami N', 'Gradishar, William J']","['Shah AN', 'Gradishar WJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1347-3782'],"['Lynn Sage Breast Cancer Program, Robert H.

Although intensive, remission induction chemotherapy is often used subsequently, in particular to bridge to allogeneic transplantation, it is not clear whether an advantage exists for any particular regimen. Based on an international collaboration, we retrospectively analyzed induction response rate and survival in 366 patients after HMA failure. Patients received 7+3, intermediate- to high-dose cytarabine (IDAC), or purine nucleoside analog-based regimens. For the MDS cohort (n = 307), the overall response rate (ORR) was 41%; median overall survival (OS) was 10.8 months, and 40% of responding patients bridged to allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). For the AML cohort (n = 59), the ORR was 32%, OS 6 months, and 42% of responding patients bridged to allo-SCT. Prognostic factors for response in MDS included adverse cytogenetics (odds ratio [OR], 0.46, P = .01), age >/=65 years (OR, 0.47; P < .01), and use of IDAC (OR, 2.91, P = .01). Shorter survival was associated with adverse cytogenetics (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; P = .06). In the AML cohort, OS was decreased by disease progression at time of HMA failure (HR, 2.66; P = .02) and prolonged with use of an anthracycline-containing regimen (HR, 0.37; P = .01). In conclusion, intensive chemotherapy after HMA failure may be a reasonable treatment option for selected patients as a bridge to allogeneic transplantation and should be considered a potential platform for future investigations.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Ball, Brian', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'DeZern, Amy E', 'Pleyer, Lisa', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Almeida, Antonio', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Cluzeau, Thomas', 'Platzbecker, Uwe', 'Gore, Steven D', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Prebet, Thomas']","['Ball B', 'Komrokji RS', 'Ades L', 'Sekeres MA', 'DeZern AE', 'Pleyer L', 'Vey N', 'Almeida A', 'Germing U', 'Cluzeau T', 'Platzbecker U', 'Gore SD', 'Fenaux P', 'Prebet T']",,"['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Malignant Hematology Department, H.

This study assessed intracellular ara-CTP levels following in vitro exposure of human immortalised leukaemic cell lines and primary AML blasts to CPX-351, and investigated fludarabine potentiation of intracellular ara-CTP formation from CPX-351. Comparison of intracellular handling of CPX-351 to cytarabine in HL-60 cells indicated slower conversion to ara-CTP for CPX-351, but equivalent cytotoxicity to cytarabine and combined DNR/cytarabine (DA) at 48 h, mostly likely reflecting the need for intracellular liposome processing to release encapsulated drugs. Further assessment demonstrated cytotoxicity of CPX-351 to be superior to DA at 48 and 72 h in cytarabine-resistant THP-1 cells (p < 0.001), and this effect could not be inhibited upon blockade of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT) function with dipyridamole. Assessment of Flu-CPX in primary blasts from presentation AML patients (n = 5) demonstrated a more rapid and pronounced potentiation of ara-CTP from CPX-351 than in immortalised cell lines, with 4/5 patients showing significant increases in ara-CTP, notably for those that went on to fail induction and relapse treatment in vivo (n = 3).

The diversity of clinical presentations and the histopathological features have made diagnosis of such lymphomas a complex task for specialists. Computer aided diagnosis systems employ computational vision and image processing techniques, which contribute toward the detection, diagnosis and prognosis of digitised images of histological samples. Studies aimed at improving the understanding of morphological and non-morphological features for classification of lymphoma remain a challenge in this area. This work presents a new approach for the classification of information extracted from morphological and non-morphological features of nuclei of lymphoma images. We extracted data of the RGB model of the image and employed contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation and 2D order-statistics filter methods to enhance the contrast and remove noise. The regions of interest were identified by the global thresholding method. The flood-fill and watershed techniques were used to remove the small false positive regions. The area, extent, perimeter, convex area, solidity, eccentricity, equivalent diameter, minor axis and major axis measurements were computed for the regions detected in the nuclei. In the feature selection stage, we applied the ANOVA, Ansari-Bradley and Wilcoxon rank sum methods. Finally, we employed the polynomial, support vector machine, random forest and decision tree classifiers in order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. The non-morphological features achieved higher AUC and AC values for all cases: the obtained rates were between 95% and 100%. These results are relevant, especially when we consider the difficulties of clinical practice in distinguishing the studied groups. The proposed approach is useful as an automated protocol for the diagnosis of lymphoma histological tissue.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of SNHG12 in doxorubicin resistance of osteosarcoma is still unclear. In present study, we explored the function and underlying mechanism of SNHG12 on doxorubicin resistance in osteosarcoma. High expression of SNHG12 was associated with doxorubicin resistance and a poor overall survival in osteosarcoma. Furthermore, doxorubicin-resistant cells revealed a higher expression of SNHG12 compared with doxorubicin-sensitive cells. Moreover, dual luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation assays revealed that miR-320a targeted to SNHG12. Besides, knockdown of SNHG12 contributed to the upregulation of miR-320a and improved the sensitivity of doxorubicin. Additionally, miR-320a inhibited the expression of Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1). Finally, the results indicated that SNHG12 mediated doxorubicin resistance of osteosarcoma via miR-320a/MCL1 axis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Male Balb/c mice were intraperitoneally injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (400mg/kg) or saline solution, once per day for 3 days before surgery, and then the model of hepatic I/R injury was established. Blood and liver samples were collected from each group at 3, 6, and 24h after surgery. Liver pathological changes, liver function, hepatocyte apoptosis and proinflammatory factors were detected. KCs were extracted, cultured and treated with TUDCA or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 24h, and then viability and phagocytosis were examined. Additionally, IRE1alpha/TRAF2/NF-kappaB pathway activity and AML cell apoptosis were detected. The results showed that TUDCA alleviated hepatic I/R injury, the level of liver function markers, and hepatocyte apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the proinflammatory effects of KCs were suppressed by down-regulating IRE1alpha/TRAF2/NF-kappaB pathway activity in vivo. TUDCA dose-dependently suppressed the expression of inflammatory factors and IRE1alpha/TRAF2/NF-kappaB pathway activity in vitro, consistent with the in vivo results.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective evaluation of 133 Arab children treated for ALL at the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon. Incidence and severity of, as well as the timing (in weeks) at which grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropathy occurred were recorded. Genotyping for ABCB1 (rs1045642), ABCB1 (rs1128503), ABCC2 (rs717620), CEP72 (rs924607), ETAA1 (rs17032980), and MTNR1B (rs12786200) was performed. RESULTS: A total of 26 (19.5%) individuals developed peripheral neuropathy, three of which occurred during the induction phase. No statistically significant associations were revealed for any of the polymorphisms with either incidence of vincristine-related toxicity, toxicity severity, or time to the first episode of grade 2 or higher vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy. CONCLUSION: This study presents the first pharmacogenetic analysis of vincristine-related peripheral neuropathy in children with ALL in an Arab country. We have shown that genetic polymorphisms in candidate genes are not associated with peripheral neuropathy secondary to chronic therapy with high-dose vincristine (2 mg/m) during the continuation phase. Concerning CEP72, our results are in line with the findings from the St Jude cohort of children treated for ALL with higher vincristine doses during chronic treatment. Larger high-throughput genetic analyses may be warranted to evaluate variants in other candidate genes such as CYP3A5 and reveal new nonpreviously reported alleles that may be peculiar to this region of the world.",,"['Zgheib, Nathalie K', 'Ghanem, Khaled M', 'Tamim, Hani', 'Aridi, Carole', 'Shahine, Randa', 'Tarek, Nidale', 'Saab, Raya', 'Abboud, Miguel R', 'El-Solh, Hassan', 'Muwakkit, Samar A']","['Zgheib NK', 'Ghanem KM', 'Tamim H', 'Aridi C', 'Shahine R', 'Tarek N', 'Saab R', 'Abboud MR', 'El-Solh H', 'Muwakkit SA']",,"['Departments of Pharmacology and Toxicology.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Internal Medicine and Clinical Research Institute, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.', 'Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (CEP72 protein, human)', '0 (ETAA1 protein, human)', '0 (MTNR1B protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Melatonin, MT2)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP3A5 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics', 'Adolescent', 'Antigens, Surface/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A/*genetics', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics', 'Peripheral Nervous System Diseases/chemically induced/*genetics/pathology', 'Pharmacogenomic Testing', 'Receptor, Melatonin, MT2/genetics', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/*adverse effects']",,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000345 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2018 Aug;28(8):189-195. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000345.,8,189-195,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before the introduction of various targeted agents, the therapeutic approach was based on regimens used for acute lymphoblastic or myeloid leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (e.g. hyperCVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone alternating with high dose methotrexate and cytarabine) and CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone) -based regimens) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation for eligible patients. Given that this disease primarily affects older patients, there is a significant barrier to using these highly toxic regimens, even though these regimens are usually associated with the most durable response. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we briefly discuss outcomes with the use of leukemia-based induction regimens as well as the use of stem cell transplant. We also review low-intensity chemotherapeutic regimens. Finally, we will describe both preclinical and early clinical data regarding novel targeted strategies for treating BPDCN without the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy, with a focus on the use of CD123 directed therapy. EXPERT OPINION: While the current standard treatment for BPDCN is acute leukemia-based regimen followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for transplant-eligible patients, there are very promising results for CD123 directed therapies. The future of BPDCN treatment may include targeted therapies without the need for cytotoxic chemotherapy.",,"['Kerr, Daniel 2nd', 'Sokol, Lubomir']","['Kerr D 2nd', 'Sokol L']",,"['a Department of Malignant Hematology , Moffitt Cancer Center/University of South Florida , Tampa , FL , USA.', 'a Department of Malignant Hematology , Moffitt Cancer Center/University of South Florida , Tampa , FL , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180827,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BPDCN', '*CAR-T', '*CD123', '*SL-401', '*leukemia', '*stem cell transplant']",,2018/08/18 06:00,2018/09/13 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2018.1512970 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2018 Sep;27(9):733-739. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2018.1512970.

Stimulation of these pathways inhibits GSK-3 to modulate diverse downstream effectors that include transcription factors, nutrient sensors, glycogen synthesis, mitochondrial function, circadian rhythm, and cell fate. GSK-3 also regulates alternative splicing in response to T-cell receptor activation, and recent phosphoproteomic studies have revealed that multiple splicing factors and regulators of RNA biosynthesis are phosphorylated in a GSK-3-dependent manner. Furthermore, inhibition of GSK-3 alters the splicing of hundreds of mRNAs, indicating a broad role for GSK-3 in the regulation of RNA processing. GSK-3-regulated phosphoproteins include SF3B1, SRSF2, PSF, RBM8A, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and PHF6, many of which are mutated in leukemia and myelodysplasia. As GSK-3 is inhibited by pathways that are pathologically activated in leukemia and loss of Gsk3 in hematopoietic cells causes a severe myelodysplastic neoplasm in mice, these findings strongly implicate GSK-3 as a critical regulator of mRNA processing in normal and malignant hematopoiesis.

Metabolic reprogramming, mainly driven by deregulation of the nutrient-sensing pathways as AMPK, mTOR and PI3K/AKT, has been associated with cancer cells, including AML cells, survival and proliferation. Nevertheless, the role of these metabolic adaptations on the AML pathogenesis is still controversial. In this work, the metabolic status and the respective metabolic networks operating in different AML cells (NB-4, HL-60 and KG-1) and their impact on autophagy and survival was characterized. Data show that whereas KG-1 cells exhibited preferential mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation metabolism with constitutive co-activation of AMPK and mTORC1 associated with increased autophagy, NB-4 and HL-60 cells displayed a dependent glycolytic profile mainly associated with AKT/mTORC1 activation and low autophagy flux. Inhibition of AKT is disclosed as a promising therapeutical target in some scenarios while inhibition of AMPK and mTORC1 has no major impact on KG-1 cells' survival. The results highlight an exclusive metabolic profile for each tested AML cells and its impact on determination of the anti-leukaemia efficacy and on personalized combinatory therapy with conventional and targeted agents.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

However, there is no validated widely accepted scoring system to predict patient subsets with higher risk of relapse. METHODS: Eleven centers in the US and Europe evaluated 247 patients with t(8;21)(q22;q22). RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) rate was high (92.7%), yet relapse occurred in 27.1% of patients. A total of 24.7% of patients received alloHCT. The median disease-free (DFS) and overall (OS) survival were 20.8 and 31.2 months, respectively. Age, KIT D816V mutated (11.3%) or nontested (36.4%) compared with KIT D816V wild type (52.5%), high white blood cell counts (WBC), and pseudodiploidy compared with hyper- or hypodiploidy were included in a scoring system (named I-CBFit). DFS rate at 2 years was 76% for patients with a low-risk I-CBFit score compared with 36% for those with a high-risk I-CBFit score (P < 0.0001). Low- vs high-risk OS at 2 years was 89% vs 51% (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: I-CBFit composed of readily available risk factors can be useful to tailor the therapy of patients, especially for whom alloHCT is not need in CR1 (ie, patients with a low-risk I-CBFit score).",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Patients with four or more ED visits within any 12-month period after discharge from their index hospitalization were classified as FA. Time to FA distribution was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and factors associated with risk of FA were identified using multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS: Records for 47 235 patients were analyzed, of whom 2980 patients were FA within the study period.

Aberrant overexpression of the p53 protein is usually associated with TP53 alterations and a complex karyotype, but the prevalence and impact of p53 overexpression in AML with diploid cytogenetics is unknown. We examined 100 newly diagnosed AML patients to evaluate the impact of p53 expression status quantified in bone marrow core biopsy samples using immunohistochemistry and computer-assisted image analysis. A total of 24 patients had p53 overexpression defined as 3+ staining intensity in >/=5% of cells; this finding correlated with lower platelet counts (P = .002), absence of CD34 expression in blasts (P = .009), higher bone marrow blast counts (P = .04), and a higher frequency of FLT3 internal tandem duplication (P = .007). Overexpression of p53 independently predicted for shorter leukemia-free survival in patients who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation by univariate (P = .021) and multivariate analyses (P = .004). There was no correlation between MDM2 and p53 protein expression in this cohort. We conclude that p53 expression evaluated by immunohistochemistry in bone marrow biopsy specimens at the time of AML diagnosis may indicate distinct clinical characteristics in patients with normal diploid cytogenetics and is a potentially valuable tool that can enhance risk-stratification.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Assi, Rita', 'Gur, Hatice D', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Konoplev, Sergej N', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Daver, Naval', 'Tashakori, Mehrnoosh', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Routbort, Mark', 'Salem, Alireza', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Quesada, Andres', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Assi R', 'Gur HD', 'Loghavi S', 'Konoplev SN', 'Konopleva M', 'Daver N', 'Tashakori M', 'Kadia T', 'Routbort M', 'Salem A', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Quesada A', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Kornblau SM', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian H', 'Khoury JD']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0046-7113', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-3584']","['Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180923,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Diploidy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25255 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1376-1383. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25255.

Although it has been suggested that multilineage antigen expression portends poor response to chemotherapy, the clinical characteristics and driver mutations that underlie the pathogenesis of this rare subtype of acute leukemia are scarcely known. We identified nine cases of B/T MPAL from multiple institutions and correlated clinical and immunophenotypic findings with next-generation sequencing data. We report that B/T MPAL commonly presents with lymphadenopathy in adolescence and young adulthood. While the tumors have diverse cytogenetic and genomic perturbations, recurrent acquired aberrations include mutations in the putative transcriptional regulator PHF6 and the JAK-STAT and Ras signaling pathways. Alterations were also identified in genes encoding hematopoietic transcription factors, cell cycle regulators/tumor suppressors, and chromatin modifying enzymes. The genomic landscape of B/T MPAL strongly resembles that of T-ALL subgroups associated with early developmental arrest, while genetic alterations that are common in B-ALL were rarely seen. Two-thirds of the patients responded to ALL-based chemotherapy with or without stem cell transplantation. Our observations lay the groundwork for further study of the unique biology and clinical trajectory of B/T MPAL.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Mi, Xiaoli', 'Griffin, Gabriel', 'Lee, Winston', 'Patel, Sanjay', 'Ohgami, Robert', 'Ok, Chi Young', 'Wang, Sa', 'Geyer, Julia T', 'Xiao, Wenbin', 'Roshal, Mikhail', 'Garcia, Jacqueline S', 'Silverman, Lewis B', 'Sallan, Stephen E', 'Aster, Jon C', 'Harris, Marian H', 'Weinberg, Olga K']","['Mi X', 'Griffin G', 'Lee W', 'Patel S', 'Ohgami R', 'Ok CY', 'Wang S', 'Geyer JT', 'Xiao W', 'Roshal M', 'Garcia JS', 'Silverman LB', 'Sallan SE', 'Aster JC', 'Harris MH', 'Weinberg OK']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4424-6139', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4250-3891']","['Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University Medical Center, California.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Hematopathology, New York-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', 'Hematopathology Service, Department of Pathology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180926,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Drug Therapy/methods', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', '*Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC8193761,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/01 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25256 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1358-1367. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25256.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a curative treatment modality for ATL, and four factors, namely, age > 50 years, male recipient, lack of complete remission at transplantation, and transplantation of cord blood, were previously shown to be associated with poor survival. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 21 patients with ATL who had undergone allo-HSCT at our hospital during a 3-year period. Of 21 patients, all had at least one of the above risk factors, and 18 had two or more. With a median follow-up of 19.7 months for living patients, the 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS) rates after transplantation were 34% and 27%, respectively.

An analysis from the Acute Leukaemia Working Party (ALWP) of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT).,10.1111/bjh.15540 [doi],"Assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) is being routinely used to assess response in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). While it is well established that pre-transplant positive MRD studies predict for relapse in patients transplanted either from matched sibling donors or matched unrelated donors, it is currently unknown whether MRD has comparable prognostic value in haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT). To this end we performed a retrospective analysis using the Acute Leukaemia Working Party/European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation multicentre registry. All adult AML patients with known MRD status at transplant who underwent a first T-cell replete haplo-SCT while in remission between 2006 and 2016 were included. Two hundred and sixty-five MRD-negative and 128 MRD-positive patients were assessed. In multivariate analysis, MRD-negative patients experienced lower relapse incidence and better leukaemia-free survival (LFS) compared to MRD-positive patients. Subset analysis for MRD-positive patients revealed that patients with donors positive for cytomegalovirus experienced decreased relapse rates as well as increased survival.

Using the Mayo Clinical CLL Database, 193 CLL patients treated with ibrutinib between November 2013 and January 2017 outside the context of a clinical trial were identified; complete review of their medical records was performed for details of past history of AIC and treatment-emergent AIC. We identified 29/193 (15%) patients with history of AIC prior to ibrutinib start. Of 12 patients requiring AIC therapy at ibrutinib start, 8 (67%) were able to discontinue or de-escalate AIC treatment, and no patient had worsening of their AIC after initiating ibrutinib. Eleven (6%) patients developed treatment-emergent AIC after a median of 59 (range, 6-319) days following the initiation of ibrutinib, 7 of whom (64%) were able to continue ibrutinib. Overall and event-free survival from time of ibrutinib start were not significantly different between patients with history of AIC and those with no history of AIC.

Specific DNA primers were covalently immobilized on a gold electrode modified with carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (cMWCNTs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs). Aggregation of the ZnO-NPs is prevented by the introduction of an amino-modified silica coating, which also allows a subsequent covalent linkage to cMWCNTs. The impedimetric biosensor was typically operated at a working voltage of +10 mV vs. Ag/AgCl, in a frequency range from 100 mHz to 100 kHz. Studies on the surface morphology and electrochemical properties of the electrode demonstrated improved bioactivity. Amperometric currents and impedimetric parameters, such as charge transfer resistance, varied significantly throughout the construction of the biosensor. The hybridization process was also evidenced by changes in the topography of the surface after exposure to samples containing BCR/ABL. The gene sensor has a linear concentration range for the target gene of 6.94 aM to 694 fM with a limit of detection as low as 0.039 aM. Also, the biosensor is selective and reproducible with a standard deviation of 4.1%. Three replicates for each experimental condition were used. Hence, it is perceived to be a viable tool for early-stage diagnosis of the BCR/ABL fusion gene and monitoring of major molecular remission in clinical samples.

However, the relationship between organ transplantation and DP T cells is unclear. Here, we examined the functional characteristics of peripheral DP T cells and analyzed their significance with respect to islet graft rejection in a nonhuman primate model of islet transplantation. DP T cells were functionally equivalent to conventional CD4 and CD8 T cells in terms of helper and cytotoxic activity, respectively. DP T cells expressed high levels of CXCR5 and PD-1 and secreted IFN-gamma, IL-4, and IL-21 in amounts equivalent to those secreted by CD4 or CD8 T cells; also, they produced large amounts of granzyme B and perforin. In addition, under steady-state conditions, DP T cells expressed eomesodermin (Eomes) and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) proteins, both of which act as transcription factors in innate/memory-like T cells. The number of peripheral DP T cells in the islet transplantation model was high in the group that experienced graft rejection; this was not the case in the long-term survival group. Interestingly, numbers of effector memory T cells (TEM) within the DP T cell population increased significantly during islet graft rejection, as did those of TEM within the cytotoxic CD8 T cells. Furthermore, the most conspicuous of which was the increase of CD4(hi)CD8(low) T cell subpopulation at that point. Taken together, the data suggest that peripheral DP T cells showing an innate/memory-like phenotype have both helper and cytotoxic activity in vitro and that they may act as a novel biomarker for graft rejection after islet transplantation.",,"['Choi, Yun Jung', 'Park, Hi-Jung', 'Park, Hye Jin', 'Jung, Kyeong Cheon', 'Lee, Jae-Il']","['Choi YJ', 'Park HJ', 'Park HJ', 'Jung KC', 'Lee JI']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4870-6761'],"['Graduate Course of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate Course of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate Course of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate Course of Translational Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Transplantation Research Institute, Seoul National University Medical Research Center, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180710,Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/*immunology', 'Islets of Langerhans Transplantation/*immunology', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",PMC6079492,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2018/11/06 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2018/3861079 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2018 Jul 10;2018:3861079. doi: 10.1155/2018/3861079. eCollection 2018.,,3861079,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report a very rare case of anti-factor XI antibodies in patient with plasma cell leukemia (PCL). Case presentation: This is a 59-year-old male patient without pathological history, admitted to the nephrology department for management of renal insufficiency and anemia syndrome. The history and physical examination revealed stigmata of hemorrhagic syndrome including hemothorax and hemoptysis. The hemostasis assessment showed an isolated prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) with APTT ratio = 2.0.The index of circulating anticoagulant (37.2%) revealed the presence of circulating anticoagulants. The normalized dilute Russell viper venom time ratio of 0.99 has highlighted the absence of lupus anticoagulants. The coagulation factors assay objectified the decrease of the factor XI activity corrected by the addition of the control plasma confirming the presence of anti-factor XI autoantibodies. In addition, the blood count showed bicytopenia with non-regenerative normocytic normochromic anemia and thrombocytopenia. The blood smear demonstrated a plasma cell count of 49% (2842/mm3) evoking PCL. The bone marrow was invaded up to 90% by dystrophic plasma cells. The biochemical assessment suggested downstream renal and electrolyte disturbances from exuberant light chain production with abnormalities including hyperuricemia, hypercalcemia, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, non nephrotic-range proteinuria and high level of C reactive protein. The serum protein electrophoresis showed the presence of a monoclonal peak. The serum immunofixation test detects the presence of monoclonal free lambda light chains. He was treated with velcade, thalidomide and dexamethasone. The patient died after 2 weeks despite treatment. Conclusion: Both PCL and anti-factor XI inhibitors are two very rare entities.

Due to P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance of the tumor cells most forms of chemotherapy are of limited efficacy, therefore new treatment strategies are needed. Statin drugs have recently been found to inhibit the growth of various tumor cell types. Methods: We investigated the effects of statin drug-mediated mevalonate pathway inhibition on cell proliferation, tumor-induced cytotoxicity, cell cycle progression and ERK MAP kinase signal transduction pathway activation. Flow cytometry was used to perform the cytotoxicity and cell cycle analyses and Western blotting was used to investigate ERK MAP kinase activation. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t-test. Results: Fluvastatin and atorvastatin were found to inhibit cell growth and tumor-induced cytotoxicity. These effects were reversed by the addition of mevalonate, signifying that the impact of the drugs were on the mevalonate pathway. Both drugs affected cell cycle progression by causing a significant increase in the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase and a reduction in the S phase and the G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Low concentrations of statin drugs were able to abrogate ERK MAP kinase pathway activation, which is typically constitutively activated in aggressive natural killer cell leukemias and important in tumor-mediated cytotoxicity. Addition of statins to chemotherapy caused enhanced inhibition of cell growth and cytotoxicity, compared to either agent alone; a combination therapy that could conceivably benefit some patients. Conclusions: These investigations suggest that inhibiting the mevalonate pathway might provide a more effective therapy against this deadly disease when combined with chemotherapy. Given that millions of people are currently taking statin drugs to lower cholesterol levels, the risk profile for statin drugs and their side effects are well-known.

The FGFR1 gene is located at chromosome 8p11 and may fuse with distinct partner genes. The breakpoint cluster region gene located at chromosome 22 is one of these partner genes. The patients' clinical phenotype is primarily dependant on the partner gene that translocates with FGFR1. Of all the available examinations, determination of the chromosome karyotype is most essential for the diagnosis of EMS. In addition, regarding treatment, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is currently the optimal method. The present study presented a case of 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome with t(8;22)(p11;q11). This represents a total of 8 and 11 chromosomal translocations, which form a BCR/FGFR1 fusion gene in the patient to produce the abnormal karyotype: 46,XY,t(8;22)(p11;q11).

A total of 18 children with B-ALL and 15 age-matched healthy children were included. Reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to evaluate the mRNA levels of Foxp3, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 (CTLA4), glucocorticoid-induced tumor necrosis factor receptor (GITR), lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (R)beta/gamma, IL-6Ralpha/beta, mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (Smad)3/4 and runt-related transcription factor (RUNX)1/3 in CD4-positive cells. The concentration of cytokines in plasma were measured using a cytometric bead array. Additionally, the proportion of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs and levels of associated proteins was analyzed using flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that the proportion of CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) and expression of Foxp3 in children with B-ALL was significantly higher compared with healthy controls (P<0.05) and that transcription levels of CTLA4, GITR and LAG3 were also significantly elevated (P<0.05). Compared with healthy controls, the expression of IL-2Ralpha/beta and its downstream molecule phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (pSTAT5) in CD4-positive cells significantly increased (P<0.05); however, no significant difference of IL-2Rgamma levels was identified between the two groups. Correlation analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the expression of phosphorylated (p) signal transducer and activator of transcription factor (STAT)5 and CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs in children with B-ALL (r=0.17; P<0.05). The plasma concentration of TGF-beta, the expression of its receptor TGF-betaRI/II and downstream molecules Smad3/4 were significantly upregulated in children with B-ALL (P<0.05), whereas the expression of RUNX1/3 was lower compared with healthy controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, the expression of Smad3 and RUNX1 was positively correlated with CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs in children with B-ALL (r=0.87 and 0.60, respectively; P<0.05). Additionally, the expression of pSTAT3 in CD4-positive cells decreased significantly in pediatric patients with B-ALL when compared with healthy controls; however, plasma concentrations of IL-6 was significantly higher (P<0.05). Furthermore, a negative correlation was identified between pSTAT3 and CD4(+)CD25(high)Foxp3(+) Tregs in pediatric patients with B-ALL (r=-0.39; P<0.05).

Therefore, we hypothesize that Notch1 might regulate the NF-kappaB pathway through Asb2alpha. Methods: The study involved down-regulation of Notch1 in T-ALL cell lines (CCRF-CEM cells and MOLT-4 cells) through treatment with gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI) as well as the modulation of Asb2 in CCRF-CEM cells and MOLT-4 cells through transduction with lentivirus carrying Asb2 or Asb2-shRNA. Experiments using real-time PCR, western blot and co-immunoprecipitation were performed to evaluate the expression levels of related genes. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured while the expression of Asb2 was enhanced or inhibited. Results: Here, we demonstrated for the first time that Notch1 can activate the transcription of Asb2alpha, which then stimulates activation of NF-kappaB in T-ALL cells. Asb2alpha exerts its effects by inducing degradation and dissociation of IkappaBalpha from NF-kappaB in T-ALL cells. Moreover, specific suppression of Asb2alpha expression can promote apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of T-ALL cells. Conclusion: Notch1 modulates the NF-kappaB pathway through Asb2alpha, indicating that Asb2alpha inhibition is a promising option for targeted therapy against T-ALL.",,"['Wu, Wei', 'Nie, Li', 'Zhang, Li', 'Li, Yan']","['Wu W', 'Nie L', 'Zhang L', 'Li Y']",,"[""1Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1758 2270grid.412632.0"", ""2Department of Geriatrics, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1758 2270grid.412632.0"", ""3Department of Hematology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1758 2270grid.412632.0"", ""1Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060 People's Republic of China.0000 0004 1758 2270grid.412632.0""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180809,England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,"['0 (ASB2 protein, human)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)']",IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', 'NF-kappa B/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Receptors, Notch/*immunology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins/genetics/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",PMC6085606,['NOTNLM'],"['Asb2', 'NF-kappaB', 'Notch1', 'T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia']","['Not applicable.

The disease is caused by a mutation in the PIG-A gene that leads to the lack of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored complement regulatory molecules CD55 and CD59 on affected blood cell surfaces. In previous studies, spontaneous clinical remissions have been described. The disease manifestations are very heterogeneous, and we wanted to examine if true remissions and disappearance of the clone occur. In a follow-up of a nation-wide cohort of 106 Finnish patients with a PNH clone, we found six cases, where the clone disappeared or was clearly diminished. Two of the patients subsequently developed leukemia, while the other four are healthy and in clinical remission. According to our data, spontaneous remissions are not as frequent as described earlier. Since the disappearance of the PNH cell clone may indicate either a favorable or a poor outcome-remission or malignancy-careful clinical monitoring in PNH is mandatory.

At the 60(th) month, estimated CBMR and CEMR incidences were, respectively, 14.3 (5.1)% and 25.9 (6.6)% in ALL, 25.8 (5.9)% and 15.5 (4.8)% in AML, and 61.5 (16.5)% and 17.9 (13.4)% in CML. Among multiple parameters, the only type of conditioning regimen (p:0.046), EM involvement at diagnosis (p:0.009), and the presence of GVHD were found to be associated with EM relapse risk independently (p:0.045). Chronic GVHD and TBI-based regimens significantly decreased the EM relapse risk, whereas it was higher with Mel/Flu and its variants. In conclusion, EM relapse is not uncommon after alloHSCT. GVHD and TBI-based regimens may prevent this complication.",,"['Gunes, Gursel', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Gunes G', 'Goker H', 'Demiroglu H', 'Malkan UY', 'Buyukasik Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey. gursel_gunes@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Education and Research Hospital, University of Health Sciences, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180816,England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*adverse effects/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*adverse effects/methods']",,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2020/04/28 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41409-018-0303-5 [doi]', '10.1038/s41409-018-0303-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2019 Apr;54(4):595-600. doi: 10.1038/s41409-018-0303-5.

Approval was based on results from CPKC412D2201, a single-arm trial of midostaurin (100 mg orally twice daily) in previously treated or untreated patients. For the patients with ASM and SM-AHN, efficacy was established on the basis of confirmed complete remission (CR) plus incomplete remission (ICR) by modified Valent criteria with six cycles of midostaurin. There were no CRs reported; ICR was achieved by 6 of 16 patients (38%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 15%-65%) with ASM and by 9 of 57 patients (16%; 95% CI: 7%-28%) with SM-AHN. Within the follow-up period, the median duration of response was not reached for the patients with ASM (range, 12.1+ to 36.8+ months) or with SM-AHN (range, 6.6+ to 52.1+ months). For the patients with MCL, efficacy was established on the basis of confirmed CR using modified 2013 International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment-European Competence Network on Mastocytosis criteria. Of 21 patients with MCL, 1 (5%) achieved a CR. Of 142 patients with SM evaluated for safety, 56% had dose modifications for toxicity, and 21% discontinued treatment due to a toxicity. Over 50% reported nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and >/=30% reported edema, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, abdominal pain, or upper respiratory tract infection. New or worsening grade >/=3 lymphopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, or neutropenia developed in >/=20%. Although midostaurin is an active drug for treatment of advanced SM, it is not clear that the optimal dose has been identified. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Midostaurin is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved therapy for patients with systemic mastocytosis with associated hematological neoplasm and mast cell leukemia and is the only therapy approved for patients with aggressive systemic mastocytosis regardless of KIT D816V mutation status. Based on response rate and duration, midostaurin has meaningful clinical activity in these rare, life-threatening diseases.","['Published 2018.

Thus, elucidating epigenetic dysregulation in AML is crucial to understand disease mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that metal response element binding transcription factor 2/polycomblike 2 (MTF2/PCL2) plays a fundamental role in the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and that its loss elicits an altered epigenetic state underlying refractory AML. Unbiased systems analyses identified the loss of MTF2-PRC2 repression of MDM2 as central to, and therefore a biomarker for, refractory AML. Thus, immature MTF2-deficient CD34(+)CD38(-) cells overexpress MDM2, thereby inhibiting p53 that leads to chemoresistance due to defects in cell-cycle regulation and apoptosis. Targeting this dysregulated signaling pathway by MTF2 overexpression or MDM2 inhibitors sensitized refractory patient leukemic cells to induction chemotherapeutics and prevented relapse in AML patient-derived xenograft mice. Therefore, we have uncovered a direct epigenetic mechanism by which MTF2 functions as a tumor suppressor required for AML chemotherapeutic sensitivity and identified a potential therapeutic strategy to treat refractory AML.Significance: MTF2 deficiency predicts refractory AML at diagnosis. MTF2 represses MDM2 in hematopoietic cells and its loss in AML results in chemoresistance. Inhibiting p53 degradation by overexpressing MTF2 in vitro or by using MDM2 inhibitors in vivo sensitizes MTF2-deficient refractory AML cells to a standard induction-chemotherapy regimen.

We conducted a phase 1-2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of six cycles of chlorambucil (7 mg/m(2) daily), rituximab (375 mg/m(2) cycle 1 and 500 mg/m(2) cycles 2-6) and individually-dosed lenalidomide (escalated from 2.5 mg to 10 mg) (induction-I) in first-line treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia unfit for treatment with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab. This was followed by 6 months of 10 mg lenalidomide monotherapy (induction-II). Of 53 evaluable patients in phase 2 of the study, 47 (89%) completed induction-I and 36 (68%) completed induction-II. In an intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 83%. The median progression-free survival was 49 months, after a median follow-up time of 27 months. The 2- and 3-year progression-free survival rates were 58% and 54%, respectively. The corresponding rates for overall survival were 98% and 95%. No tumor lysis syndrome was observed, while tumor flair reaction occurred in five patients (9%, 1 grade 3). The most common hematologic toxicity was grade 3-4 neutropenia, which occurred in 73% of the patients. In conclusion, addition of lenalidomide to a chemotherapy backbone followed by a fixed duration of lenalidomide monotherapy resulted in high remission rates and progression-free survival rates, which seem comparable to those observed with novel drug combinations including novel CD20 monoclonal antibodies or kinase inhibitors. Although lenalidomide-specific toxicity remains a concern, an individualized dose-escalation schedule is feasible and results in an acceptable toxicity profile.

Roughly twice as many mHAs were predicted in HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) stem cell transplantation (SCT) compared with HLA-matched related transplants, an expected result given greater genetic disparity in MUD SCT. Computational analysis predicted 14 of 18 previously identified mHAs, with 2 minor antigen mismatches not being contained in the patient cohort, 1 missed mHA resulting from a noncanonical translation of the peptide antigen, and 1 case of poor binding prediction. A predicted peptide epitope derived from GRK4, a protein expressed in acute myeloid leukemia and testis, was confirmed by targeted differential ion mobility spectrometry-tandem mass spectrometry. T cells specific to UNC-GRK4-V were identified by tetramer analysis both in DRPs where a minor antigen mismatch was predicted and in DRPs where the donor contained the allele encoding UNC-GRK4-V, suggesting that this antigen could be both an mHA and a cancer-testis antigen. Computational analysis of genomic and transcriptomic data can reliably predict leukemia-associated mHA and can be used to guide targeted mHA discovery.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Lansford, Jefferson L', 'Dharmasiri, Udara', 'Chai, Shengjie', 'Hunsucker, Sally A', 'Bortone, Dante S', 'Keating, James E', 'Schlup, Ian M', 'Glish, Gary L', 'Collins, Edward J', 'Alatrash, Gheath', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey J', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Vincent, Benjamin G']","['Lansford JL', 'Dharmasiri U', 'Chai S', 'Hunsucker SA', 'Bortone DS', 'Keating JE', 'Schlup IM', 'Glish GL', 'Collins EJ', 'Alatrash G', 'Molldrem JJ', 'Armistead PM', 'Vincent BG']",,"['School of Medicine.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Department of Chemistry, and.', 'Department of Chemistry, and.', 'Department of Chemistry, and.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center.', 'Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Allografts', '*Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/pathology/therapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', '*Models, Immunological', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Unrelated Donors']",PMC6113610,,,,2018/08/18 06:00,2019/04/05 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/05 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018022475 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022475 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Aug 28;2(16):2052-2062. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018022475.,16,2052-2062,"['P30 CA016086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA201225/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM067553/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CLL2-BAG trial was initiated to investigate the combination of these two agents in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. METHODS: In this ongoing multicentre, open-label, investigator-initiated phase 2 trial, patients (aged >/=18 years) with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia requiring treatment according to the 2008 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) criteria and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were enrolled at 16 sites in Germany. Patients with a relevant tumour load (absolute lymphocyte count >/=25 000 cells per muL or lymph nodes with a diameter of >/=5 cm) received sequential treatment of debulking with two cycles of bendamustine (70 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1 and 2 of each of the two 28-day cycles), followed by induction and maintenance with obinutuzumab (1000 mg intravenously on days 1-2, 8, and 15 of the first induction cycle, every 4 weeks in induction cycles 2-6, and every 12 weeks in the maintenance phase) and oral venetoclax (starting in induction cycle 2 with 20 mg/day, with a weekly dose escalation over 5 weeks to the target dose of 400 mg/day). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an overall response by investigator assessment at the end of induction treatment. All patients who received at least two induction cycles were included in the efficacy analyses and all patients who received at least one dose of study drug were included in the safety analyses. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02401503. FINDINGS: Between May 6, 2015, and Jan 4, 2016, 66 patients were enrolled (35 treatment naive and 31 with relapsed or refractory disease), three of whom were excluded from the efficacy analysis because they received fewer than two induction cycles. Of the remaining 63 patients in the efficacy-evaluable population, 34 patients (54%) were treatment naive and 29 (46%) had relapsed or refractory disease. At data cutoff (Feb 28, 2017), all patients had completed induction treatment. At the end of the induction, 60 (95%) of 63 patients (95% CI 87-99) had responded, including all 34 patients in the treatment-naive cohort and 26 [90%] of 29 relapsed or refractory patients. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events during debulking were neutropenia and anaemia (five [11%] of 47 patients each), and thrombocytopenia and infection (three [6%] each). The most common grade 3-4 adverse events during induction were neutropenia (29 [44%] of 66 patients), infection (nine [14%]), thrombocytopenia (eight [12%]), infusion-related reactions (five [8%]), and secondary primary malignancy (four [6%]). 89 serious adverse events, including 69 related to study treatment, were reported. These serious adverse events were also mainly infections (four cases in four patients during debulking and 18 cases in 11 patients during induction) and cytopenia (four cases in four patients during debulking and ten cases in seven patients in induction). Five relapsed or refractory patients died: three cases of sepsis were deemed related to study treatment, whereas two deaths from Richter's transformation were not. INTERPRETATION: The sequential application of bendamustine and obinutuzumab combined with venetoclax caused no unexpected or cumulative toxicities. The high proportion of patients who achieved overall responses, both treatment-naive and relapsed or refractory patients irrespective of physical fitness and genetic risk factors, compare favourably to established chronic lymphocytic leukaemia therapies. Further follow-up will help to define whether the remissions with eradication of minimal residual disease achieved with this combination are durable after treatment discontinuation.

We studied a new low-intensity regimen of cladribine combined with low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine, aimed at improving outcomes in this population. Based on our previous experience, we hypothesised that this combination would be safe and more effective than current approaches with hypomethylating agents. METHODS: In this single-arm, open-label, single-centre phase 2 study, we enrolled patients aged 60 years or older with previously untreated AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome who had adequate organ function and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 or less. Patients were treated with cladribine plus low-dose cytarabine for two 28-day cycles alternating with decitabine for two 28-day cycles, for up to 18 cycles. Induction therapy (cycle 1) consisted of cladribine 5 mg/m(2) intravenously over 1-2 h on days 1-5 and cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously twice daily on days 1-10. Patients who had remission during this induction regimen moved on to consolidation therapy (cladribine 5 mg/m(2) intravenously over 1-2 h on days 1-3 and cytarabine 20 mg twice daily on days 1-10, alternating with decitabine 20 mg/m(2) intravenously on days 1-5). The primary outcome measure was disease-free survival. Secondary outcomes were overall survival, proportion of patients achieving complete response, proportion of patients achieving response, toxicity, and induction mortality. All treated patients were included in the analyses. This trial is ongoing and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01515527. FINDINGS: Between Feb 17, 2012, and July 6, 2017, 118 patients were enrolled and treated, among whom 48 (41%) had an adverse karyotype, 20 (17%) had therapy-related AML, 18 (15%) had treated secondary AML, and 20 (17%) had TP53 mutations. Median disease-free survival was 10.8 months (IQR 5.4-25.9). 80 (68%) patients achieved objective response: 69 (58%) achieved a complete response and 11 (9%) patients had complete response with incomplete count recovery. The median overall survival was 13.8 months (6.9-28.6). The regimen was well tolerated, with one (1%) death within the first 4 weeks and eight (7%) deaths within the first 8 weeks. The most common non-haematological adverse events of grade 3 or worse were infection (88 [75%] patients), elevated total bilirubin (26 [22%] patients), rash (13 [11%] patients), and nausea (13 [11%] patients). INTERPRETATION: The combination of cladribine and low-dose cytarabine alternating with decitabine appears to be a safe and highly effective regimen for the treatment of elderly or unfit patients with newly diagnosed AML. Further testing of this regimen is warranted, and could help to provide a new, effective option for reduced-intensity therapy in this population.

However, few studies of children with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL from China have been conducted. It is largely unknown whether clinical outcomes for patients with this genotype and important factors that influence such outcomes are similar to those reported in other countries. Therefore, it is important to analyze the outcomes of children with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL treated at our institution with the aim of identifying significant prognostic variables in a Chinese population. METHODS: We studied the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes for 77 pediatric patients diagnosed with ETV6/RUNX1-positive ALL between 2005 and 2015 at our institution. RESULTS: The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and the disease-free survival (DFS) were reported to be 90% +/- 3% and 96% +/- 3% respectively. Two patients had a relapse at a median of 42 months from diagnosis and the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 2.1%. Despite intensive chemotherapy or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation, the 2 relapsed patients succumbed to the disease progression and the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 97% +/- 2%. Multivariate analysis for EFS revealed that the minimal residual disease (MRD) >/=10(- 3) on Day + 33 negatively affected the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, patients with ETV6/RUNX1 fusion transcript can achieve a high rate of complete remission and the long-term curative effect was excellent under risk-stratified treatment. In case of relapse, the MRD level at the end of induction therapy should be taken into consideration while deciding the appropriate chemotherapy dosage.",,"['Wang, Yu', 'Zeng, Hui-Min', 'Zhang, Le-Ping']","['Wang Y', 'Zeng HM', 'Zhang LP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6008-810X'],"[""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, China."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, China. zengpretty@aliyun.com."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Peking University People's Hospital, No.11 Xizhimen South Street, Beijing, 100044, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180816,England,Ital J Pediatr,Italian journal of pediatrics,101510759,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Daunorubicin', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Prednisone', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/*genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine']",PMC6097322,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ETV6/RUNX1', 'MRD', 'Prognosis']",,2018/08/18 06:00,2019/01/03 06:00,['2018/08/18 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/03 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13052-018-0541-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13052-018-0541-6 [pii]']",epublish,Ital J Pediatr. 2018 Aug 16;44(1):94. doi: 10.1186/s13052-018-0541-6.,1,94,['81641007/The Natural Science Foundation of China'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Matrine (MAT) could improve the differentiation ability of ATRA-resistant APL cells. This study aimed to explore how the APL-specific fusion protein was degraded in ATRA-resistant APL with the application of MAT and ATRA. METHODS: ATRA-sensitive (NB4) and ATRA-resistant (NB4-LR1) cell lines were used. Nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the differentiation ability. The activity of ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-mediated pathways in both cells treated with ATRA with or without MAT were compared in protein and mRNA level (Western blot analysis, qRT-PCR), the Fluorescent substrate Suc-LLVY-AMC detection was used to detect the activity of proteasome, and electron microscope for observing autophagosome. MG 132(proteasome inhibitor), rapamycin (autophagy activator), hydroxychloroquine (lysosomal inhibitor) and STI571 [retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) ubiquitin stabilizer] were used as positive controls. The effect of MAT was observed in vivo using xenografts. RESULTS: MAT improved the sensitivity of NB4-LR1cells to ATRA treatment, which was consistent with the expression of PML-RARalpha fusion protein. MAT promoted the ubiquitylation level in NB4-LR1. MG 132 induced the decrease in RARalpha in both cell lines, and hampered the differentiation of NB4 cells. MAT also promoted the autophagy in NB4-LR1 cells, with an increase in microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain3 (LC3)-II and LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and exhaustion of P62. The expression of LC3II increased significantly in the MAT and ATRA + MAT groups in combination with lysosomal inhibitors. A similar phenomenon was observed in mouse xenografts. MAT induced apoptosis and differentiation. CONCLUSIONS: Autophagy and ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of PML/RARalpha fusion protein are crucial in MAT-induced differentiation sensitivity recovery of NB4-LR1 cells.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Why the survival rate of patients with unmutated IgHV is worse than that of patients with mutated IgHV is unknown. CLL cells with unmutated IgHV were thought to originate from naive B lymphocytes, whereas CLL cells with mutated IgHV were thought to arise from B cells that have undergone somatic hypermutation (SHM). Cell surface protein expression profile and gene expression studies showing that all CLL cells, regardless of their IgHV mutation status, are of postgerminal center origin, negated this hypothesis. We hereby propose that all CLL cells undergo SHM and their proliferation rate determines their IgHV mutation status. DNA breaks, accumulated during SHM, are restored by various DNA repair mechanisms. In rapidly dividing cells DNA breaks are repaired by the efficient high-fidelity homology-directed DNA repair apparatus, whereas in slowly dividing cells they are repaired by the inefficient low-fidelity nonhomology end-joining repair mechanism. Accordingly, a low IgHV mutation rate is found in rapidly dividing cells whereas a high mutation rate is typically found in slowly dividing cells. Thus, the proliferation rate of CLL cells determines the IgHV mutation status and patients' clinical outcome.","['(c) 2018 S.

Moreover, in silico predictions showed that 8q conformed to the rule of five and displayed low toxicity. However, the mechanism of anti-leukaemia action remains unclear. The aim of this research was to reveal the probable anti-leukaemia mechanism of 8q on CCRF-CEM cells. Flow cytometry assay demonstrated that 8q induced apoptosis. The expression of caspase family proteins results showed that 8q could only promote cleaved caspase-3, 7 and 9 expressions without affecting cleaved caspase-8 protein, hinting that 8q induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Further, we detected 3 indicators of mitochondrial lesions, including increased of Cyt-C release, with a decrease in MMP and ATP levels. Next, metabolomics were introduced to assist in the research of the anti-leukaemia mechanism of 8q. The metabolomics results showed that 100 nM 8q could increase the level of GSH, and decrease its oxidation products. These indicated 8q could influence the ROS, which derived by mitochondria. Then we examined the effect of 8q on intracellular ROS levels. What is particularly interesting is that 8q inhibited cell ROS stress at low concentration and stimulated ROS stress at high concentration. The pro-apoptosis mechanisms of 8q were then explored. 8q significantly decreased anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, whereas it up-regulated the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Bak, Bad, Bik and Puma expression. In addition, 8q dramatically inhibited the expression of FASN, which is related to fatty acid metabolism. Furthermore, PI3K, AKT and FOXO1 were inactivated, and the expression of total AKT was also inhibited by 8q treatment, which promoted intrinsic apoptosis.

The aim of this study was to compare lymphoblasts of BCP-ALL and HG for the expression of the most discriminating antigens. METHODS: A total of 82 bone marrow samples (39 BCP-ALL and 43 patients with HG) were analyzed using MFC. Mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was measured for ten markers commonly used in hematology laboratories: CD45, CD19, CD10, CD34, CD38, CD20, CD22, CD58, CD81, and CD123. Statistical comparison of the MFI between LB and HG was performed. The presence on LB of aberrant expression of myeloid and/or T-cell markers was also investigated. RESULTS: Qualitative pattern expression of antigens showed overexpression on LB of CD58, CD22, CD34, CD10 and underexpression of CD81, CD45, CD38 when compared to HG. Expression of CD123 was positive in 34% of BCP-ALL LB and always absent on HG. Aberrant antigen expression (myeloid and/or T-cell marker) including CD123 was observed in 58% of BCP-ALL patients. The use of a MFI antigen ratio of the most discriminating markers (CD81/CD58) (analysis of variance, P < 0.005) increased the distinction of LB versus HG with a high specificity and sensitivity as demonstrated by the use of ROC curve analysis (AUC of CD81/CD58: 0.995). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate in this study that routine use of the MFI antigen ratio (CD81/CD58) in addition to the MFC evaluation using WHO classical criteria appears to be an efficient approach to discriminate LB from HG.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Nagant, Carole', 'Casula, Daniele', 'Janssens, Anne', 'Nguyen, Vo Thanh Phuong', 'Cantinieaux, Brigitte']","['Nagant C', 'Casula D', 'Janssens A', 'Nguyen VTP', 'Cantinieaux B']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9755-5069'],"[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Reseau des Laboratoires Hospitaliers Universitaires de Bruxelles (LHUB-ULB), Bruxelles, Belgique."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Reseau des Laboratoires Hospitaliers Universitaires de Bruxelles (LHUB-ULB), Bruxelles, Belgique."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Reseau des Laboratoires Hospitaliers Universitaires de Bruxelles (LHUB-ULB), Bruxelles, Belgique."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Reseau des Laboratoires Hospitaliers Universitaires de Bruxelles (LHUB-ULB), Bruxelles, Belgique."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Reseau des Laboratoires Hospitaliers Universitaires de Bruxelles (LHUB-ULB), Bruxelles, Belgique.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180816,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (CD58 Antigens)', '0 (CD81 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Tetraspanin 28)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'CD58 Antigens/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/pathology', 'Tetraspanin 28/*blood']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BCP-ALL', 'CD81/CD58', 'MRD', 'hematogones', 'lymphoblasts']",,2018/08/17 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2017/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12912 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 Dec;40(6):734-739. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12912.

The Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI) plays an important role in mediating the uptake of high-density lipoproteins. The purpose of this study is to assess the role of the cell surface lipoprotein receptor SR-BI in the uptake of CPX-351 liposomes (Jazz Pharmaceuticals) into K562 leukemia cells. METHODS: K562 cells were pre-treated with 10 nM siRNA for 48 h and then treated with varying amount of CPX-351 for 24, 48 and 72 h. Cells were then collected and analyzed at 480/590 nm on a CytoFLEX Multicolour flow instrument to determine cellular uptake of daunorubicin. Experimental data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni multiple comparisons. Significance was set at p < .05. RESULTS: K562 cells pre-treated with SR-BI siRNA for 48 h had a reduced SRB1 cell surface concentration (74-85%). Addition of CPX-351 at 10-50 nM followed by measurement of cellular daunorubicin at 48, 48 or 72 h showed a significantly lower percentage of daunorubicin positive population compared with control K562 cells (p < .05). There was significantly less daunorubicin taken up in the SR-BI knock-down cells across all drug concentrations and at all three time points, although there were no concentration-related trends.

Nanoscale flow cytometry (nFC) is ideal for high-throughput analysis of PMPs but these clinical assays have not been developed previously. OBJECTIVE: This article demonstrates that nFC is a suitable technology to enumerate PMPs present in plasma samples in a clinical setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: nFC was performed using the Apogee A50-Micro instrument. Instrument settings and acquisition parameters were developed with the use of fluorescent beads and plasma samples. Sample preparation and handling was also optimized. RESULTS: nFC allows for linear detection of particles between approximately 200 and 1,000 nm based on calibration beads and was dependent on dilution factor and flow rate. Linearity in event analysis as samples became more diluted was lost when events approximately 100 nm were gated while linearity was maintained despite dilution of sample in events larger than 200 nm in diameter. Higher flow rates lead to an under-estimation of events analysed per microlitre of analyte and this was more pronounced when plasma samples were not diluted more than 1/20x. CONCLUSION: nFC offers multi-parametric analysis of PMPs when optimal calibration of acquisition and sample processing settings is performed. Analysis of plasmas from metastatic prostate cancer patients and leukaemia patients revealed that PMP levels were larger than 100 nm and were equally abundant in patients that responded to or failed androgen deprivation therapy or between patients representing different stages of leukaemia.",['Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

Additional to the well-established value in tumor imaging, it bears potential to depict immune processes in modern immunotherapies. T cells enhance their glucose consumption upon activation and are crucial effectors for the success of such novel therapies. In this study, we analyzed the T cell immunity in spleen after antigen-specific stimulation of T cells via highly innovative RNA-based vaccines using FDG-PET/MRI. For this purpose, we employed systemic administration of RNA-lipoplexes encoding the endogenous antigen of Moloney murine leukemia virus (gp70) which have been previously shown to induce potent innate as well as adaptive immune mechanisms for cancer immunotherapy. Feasibility of clinical imaging of increased splenic FDG uptake was demonstrated in a melanoma patient participating in a clinical phase 1 trial of a tetravalent RNA-lipoplex cancer vaccine. RESULTS: We observed exclusive increase of glucose uptake in spleen compared to other organs thanks to liposome-mediated RNA targeting to this immune-relevant organ. In vivo and ex vivo FDG uptake analysis in the spleen of vaccinated mice correlated well with antigen-specific T cell activation. Moreover, the use of an irrelevant (antigen non-specific) RNA also resulted in enhanced FDG uptake early after vaccination through the activation of several other splenic cell populations. The glucose uptake was also dependent on the dose of RNA administered in line with the activation and frequencies of proliferating antigen-specific T cells as well as the general activation pattern of splenic cell populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our preclinical results show rapid and transient vaccination-induced increase of FDG uptake within the spleen reflecting immune activation preceding T cell proliferation. FDG-PET/CT in patients is also capable to image this immune activation resulting in a new potential application of FDG-PET/CT to image immune processes in new immunological therapies.",,"['Pektor, Stefanie', 'Hilscher, Lina', 'Walzer, Kerstin C', 'Miederer, Isabelle', 'Bausbacher, Nicole', 'Loquai, Carmen', 'Schreckenberger, Mathias', 'Sahin, Ugur', 'Diken, Mustafa', 'Miederer, Matthias']","['Pektor S', 'Hilscher L', 'Walzer KC', 'Miederer I', 'Bausbacher N', 'Loquai C', 'Schreckenberger M', 'Sahin U', 'Diken M', 'Miederer M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5075-5995'],"['Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'TRON - Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'TRON - Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Biopharmaceutical New Technologies (BioNTech) Corporation, Mainz, Germany.', 'TRON - Translational Oncology at the University Medical Center of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz gGmbH, Mainz, Germany.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center Mainz of Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.

It is highly expressed in abnormal human embryonic heart. We previously reported that overexpression of uc.40 promoted apoptosis and inhibited proliferation of P19 cells, and downregulated PBX1, which was identified as a potential target gene of uc.40. The current study evaluated the effects of uc40-siRNA-44 (siRNA against uc.40) on the differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and mitochondrial function in P19 cells, and investigated the relationship between uc.40 and PBX1 in cardiomyocytes. The uc.40 silencing expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Observation of morphological changes in transfected P19 cells during different stages of differentiation revealed that uc40-siRNA-44 increased the number of cardiomyocyes. There was no significant difference in the morphology or time of differentiation between the uc40-siRNA-44 group and the control group. uc40-siRNA-44 significantly promoted proliferation of P19 cells and inhibited serum starvation-induced apoptosis. There was no significant difference in mitochondrial DNA copy number or cellular ATP level between the two groups, and ROS levels were significantly decreased in uc40-siRNA-44-transfected cells. The levels of PBX1 and myocardial markers of differentiation were examined in transfected P19 cells; uc40-siRNA-44 downregulated myocardial markers and upregulated PBX1 expression. These results suggest that uc.40 may play an important role during the differentiation of P19 cells by regulation of PBX1 to promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis.

The aim of the present study was to summarize the clinical characteristics and treatment methods of a case of Ph(+) ALL complicated by BMN and ARI. A 23-year-old male patient presented with pyrexia and a 2-month history of bone pain, and was diagnosed with Ph(+) ALL complicated with BMN and ARI on peripheral blood tests, blood biochemistry tests, BM smear and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The patient underwent repeated hemodialysis, imatinib combination and maintenance chemotherapy, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Some of the clinical signs and symptoms were alleviated, whereas others disappeared, and renal function was restored to normal. BM aspiration confirmed absence of necrosis and null lymphoblasts. Therefore, timely accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are crucial for patients with Ph(+) ALL exhibiting potentially fatal complications.",,"['Xia, Jieyun', 'Sun, Haiying', 'Yan, Zhiling', 'Zhu, Feng', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Xu, Kailin']","['Xia J', 'Sun H', 'Yan Z', 'Zhu F', 'Zhao K', 'Xu K']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, Jiangsu 221002, P.R.

Efficient combinations of sorafenib with targeted inhibitors blocking AKT/mTOR.,10.18632/oncotarget.25766 [doi],"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. There is increasing interest in developing specific markers to serve as predictors of response to sorafenib and to guide targeted therapy. Using a sequencing platform designed to study somatic mutations in a selection of 112 genes (HepatoExome), we aimed to characterize lesions from HCC patients and cell lines, and to use the data to study the biological and mechanistic effects of case-specific targeted therapies used alone or in combination with sorafenib. We characterized 331 HCC cases in silico and 32 paired samples obtained prospectively from primary tumors of HCC patients. Each case was analyzed in a time compatible with the requirements of the clinic (within 15 days). In 53% of the discovery cohort cases, we detected unique mutational signatures, with up to 34% of them carrying mutated genes with the potential to guide therapy. In a panel of HCC cell lines, each characterized by a specific mutational signature, sorafenib elicited heterogeneous mechanistic and biological responses, whereas targeted therapy provoked the robust inhibition of cell proliferation and DNA synthesis along with the blockage of AKT/mTOR signaling. The combination of sorafenib with targeted therapies exhibited synergistic anti-HCC biological activity concomitantly with highly effective inhibition of MAPK and AKT/mTOR signaling. Thus, somatic mutations may lead to identify case-specific mechanisms of disease in HCC lesions arising from multiple etiologies. Moreover, targeted therapies guided by molecular characterization, used alone or in combination with sorafenib, can effectively block important HCC disease mechanisms.",,"['Llerena, Susana',

We show that DNA damage response (DDR) activation leads to down-modulating the transcriptional factor FOXP1, which functions as a positive BCR signalling regulator and its high levels are associated with worse CLL prognosis. We identified microRNA (miRNA) miR-34a as the most prominently upregulated miRNA during DDR in CLL cells in vitro and in vivo during FCR therapy (fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab). MiR-34a induced by DDR activation and p53 stabilization potently represses FOXP1 expression by binding in its 3'-UTR. The low FOXP1 levels limit BCR signalling partially via derepressing BCR-inhibitory molecule CD22. We also show that low miR-34a levels can be used as a biomarker for worse response or shorter progression free survival in CLL patients treated with FCR chemoimmunotherapy, and shorter overall survival, irrespective of TP53 status. Additionally, we have developed a method for the absolute quantification of miR-34a copies and defined precise prognostic/predictive cutoffs. Overall, herein, we reveal for the first time that B cells limit their BCR signalling during DDR by down-modulating FOXP1 via DDR-p53/miR-34a axis.",,"['Cerna, Katerina', 'Oppelt, Jan', 'Chochola, Vaclav', 'Musilova, Katerina', 'Seda, Vaclav', 'Pavlasova, Gabriela', 'Radova, Lenka', 'Arigoni, Maddalena', 'Calogero, Raffaele A', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Trbusek, Martin', 'Brychtova, Yvona', 'Doubek, Michael', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Pospisilova, Sarka', 'Mraz, Marek']","['Cerna K', 'Oppelt J', 'Chochola V', 'Musilova K', 'Seda V', 'Pavlasova G', 'Radova L', 'Arigoni M', 'Calogero RA', 'Benes V', 'Trbusek M', 'Brychtova Y', 'Doubek M', 'Mayer J', 'Pospisilova S', 'Mraz M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0352-2547'],"['Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'National Centre for Biomolecular Research, Faculty of Science, MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Bioinformatics and Genomics Unit, MBC Centro di Biotecnologie Molecolari, Torino, Italy.', 'Bioinformatics and Genomics Unit, MBC Centro di Biotecnologie Molecolari, Torino, Italy.', 'Genomics Core Facility, EMBL Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Molecular Medicine, CEITEC MU, Brno, Czech Republic. marek.mraz@email.cz.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine MU, Brno, Czech Republic. marek.mraz@email.cz.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180815,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (FOXP1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Rituximab/administration & dosage', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives']",,,,,2018/08/17 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0230-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0230-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):403-414. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0230-x.

All three derivatives were found to possess reduced toxicity towards human leukemia K562 cells compared to SN-38, validating a condition for prodrug action. Using an MTS assay, IC50's were found to be 3.0, 25.9, 12.2 and 58.0 nM for SN-38, 2-nitro-, 3-nitro- and 4-nitrobenzyl-C10-substituted-SN-38, respectively, representing an 8-, 4- and 19-fold decrease in cytotoxicity. Using a topoisomerase I assay, one of the analogs (4-nitrobenzyl) was shown to inhibit the ability of this enzyme to relax supercoiled pBR322 DNA, at a similar concentration to the clinically-approved active metabolite SN-38.

The electrochemical results also validated the quasi-reversible nature of the first reduction step, and served as a proof-of-principle that hypoxia-targeting prodrugs of SN-38 can participate in a redox-futile cycle, the proposed mechanism of activation and targeting.

However, combining venetoclax with other active agents raises safety concerns, as it may increase the risk for tumor lysis syndrome. To minimize this risk, we designed and implemented a fixed-duration regimen using sequentially administered obinutuzumab followed by ibrutinib (cycle 2) and venetoclax (cycle 3), for a total of fourteen 28-day cycles. This phase 1b study included 12 patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. We tested 3 dose levels of venetoclax and identified the doses of all 3 agents approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in the combination. Adverse events were consistent with known toxicities of the individual agents, with hematologic adverse events being most frequent. No clinically significant tumor lysis syndrome occurred. The overall response rate was 92% (95% confidence interval, 62%-100%), with 42% (5/12) achieving a complete remission or complete remission with incomplete marrow recovery. There were 6 patients with no detectable CLL in both the blood and bone marrow at the end of treatment. We found this regimen to be safe and tolerable in CLL, and capable of inducing deep responses, justifying future study in our ongoing phase 2 cohorts of relapsed or refractory and treatment-naive patients, as well as larger phase 3 trials currently in planning.

Here, we show that a widely used Nur77-deficient transgenic mouse model expresses a truncated protein encoding for part of the N-terminal domain of nuclear receptor Nur77. This truncated Nur77 protein is absent in a newly developed Nur77-deficient mouse strain generated using Cre-Lox recombination. Comparison of these two mouse strains using immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and colony-forming assays shows that homologous recombination-derived Nur77-deficient mice, but not WT or Cre-Lox-derived Nur77-deficient mice, suffer from liver immune cell infiltrates, loss of splenic architecture, and increased numbers of bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells and splenic colony-forming cells with age. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the truncated Nur77 N-terminal domain protein maintains the stability and activity of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1, a transcription factor known to regulate bone marrow homeostasis. Additionally, a previously discovered, but uncharacterized, human Nur77 transcript variant that encodes solely for its N-terminal domain, designated TR3beta, can also stabilize and activate HIF-1alpha. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray data sets shows that TR3beta is highly expressed in human bone marrow cells and acute myeloid leukemia samples. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that a transgenic mouse model commonly used to study the biological function of Nur77 has several major drawbacks, while simultaneously identifying the importance of nongenomic Nur77 activity in the regulation of bone marrow homeostasis.",['(c) 2018 Koenis et al.'],"['Koenis, Duco S', 'Medzikovic, Lejla', 'Vos, Mariska', 'Beldman, Thijs J', 'van Loenen, Pieter B', 'van Tiel, Claudia M', 'Hamers, Anouk A J', 'Otermin Rubio, Iker', 'de Waard, Vivian', 'de Vries, Carlie J M']","['Koenis DS', 'Medzikovic L', 'Vos M', 'Beldman TJ', 'van Loenen PB', 'van Tiel CM', 'Hamers AAJ', 'Otermin Rubio I', 'de Waard V', 'de Vries CJM']",,"['From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'From the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Amsterdam Cardiovascular Sciences, Academic Medical Center, K1-113, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, 1105 AZ Amsterdam, The Netherlands c.j.devries@amc.uva.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180815,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (NR4A1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Homeostasis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/chemistry/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1/chemistry/*genetics', 'Protein Domains/*genetics']",PMC6166732,['NOTNLM'],"['*Nur77', '*bone marrow', '*gene knockout', '*homeostasis', '*hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)', '*liver', '*nuclear receptor', '*transcript variant', '*transcription factor']",,2018/08/17 06:00,2019/03/05 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35286-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.002720 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Sep 28;293(39):15070-15083. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.002720.

METHODS: R banding technique was used for karyotype analysis in 43 cases of CLL, and fluorescence in situ hybridizationFISH technique was used for analysis of 5 genes in 43 cases of CLL, including D13S25, RB1,ATM, P53 and CEP 12 . RESULTS: The detection rate of chromosome abnormality was 9.3 for the 43 cases. The chromosome karyotype abnormality was involoved in the number abnormality and the structural abnormality, including No. 2, 6, 14, and sex chromosome. The patients with normal chromosome karyotype were more common79.1. At the same time, mitotic figure in 5 CLL patients did not observed. The positive rate of FISH detection was 55.8(24/43). Among which, D13S25 deletion was the highest and reached to 37.2, followed by RB1 deletion20.9, CEP 12 amplification16.3, ATM deletion9.3 and P53 deletion7.0.

According to 4 prognostic factors such as presence of CNS leukemia or no, WBC count>/=100x10(9)/L or no, induction chemotherapy with L-Asp or no and CR after induction chemotherapy for 4 weeks or no, 86 patients were divided into low-risk group (without poor prognostic factor), middle-risk group (with 1 poor prognostic factor), high-risk group (with 2-4 poor prognostic factors). Statistical results showed that allo-HSCT treatment in low-risk group had no significant effect on OS and DFS (P>0.05). The rate of OS and DFS in middle and high-risk group were significantly higher than those of patients without allo-HSCT treatment (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Patients with central nervous system leukemia, high white blood cell count (>/=100x10(9)/L), induction chemotherapy without L-Asp, no CR after 4 weeks of chemotherapy and absence of allo-HSCT treatment are the factors influencing the prognosis of adult patients with Ph negative ALL, so the patients with those poor prognostic factors should take active treatment of allo-HSCT.",,"['Li, Juan', 'Zhang, Zhi-Biao', 'Liu, Zheng-Rong', 'Yang, Mei', 'Nie, Yan-Xia', 'Wu, Meng-Meng']","['Li J', 'Zhang ZB', 'Liu ZR', 'Yang M', 'Nie YX', 'Wu MM']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The Fifth People's HospitalAnyang 455000, Henan Province, China.E-mailaylijuanbobo@163.com."", ""Department of Hematology, Anyang People's Hospital, Anyang 455000, Henan Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anyang People's Hospital, Anyang 455000, Henan Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth People's HospitalAnyang 455000, Henan Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anyang People's Hospital, Anyang 455000, Henan Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fifth People's HospitalAnyang 455000, Henan Province, China.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],,China,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi,101084424,,IM,"['Adult', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",,,,,2018/08/17 06:00,2018/11/14 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['1009-2137201804-1011-05 [pii]', '10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.04.011 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhongguo Shi Yan Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2018 Aug;26(4):1011-1015. doi: 10.7534/j.issn.1009-2137.2018.04.011.,4,1011-1015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The clinical data of 132 patients with newly diagnosed AML (all non-acute promyelotic leukemia) from 2011 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The 132 AML patients were treated with standard induction chemotherapy (IC) and consolidation chemotherapy (CC). According to lymphocyte count of patients before start of the first cycle of CC, the AML patients were divided into 2 group: high lymphocyte count group (H-Lym>/=1.2x10(9)/L) and low lymphocyte count group (L-Lym<1.2x10(9)/L). The differences in ralapse rate and relapse-free survival between 2 groups were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 132 patients with AML, patients who could be valuated and were elicible for the study accounted for 65 (49.24%). The absolute leukocyte count, age, chromosome karyotypes before IC of patients did not show statistical difference between H-Lym group (40 cases) and L-Lym group (25 cases). Unvarvate analysis showed that the Low lymphocyte count and unfavorable chromosome karyotypes were poor prognostic factors for the relapse-free survival time, and there was significant difference between 2 groups (P<0.01). The relapse risk in patients of L-Lym group increased, the hazard ratio (HR)=3.01 (95% CI=1.55-4.98) (P<0.01). In multivariate analysis containing unfavorable prognostic karyotypes, this trend still existed (HR=2.52, 95% CI 1.28-9.98)(P<0.01).

METHODS: The expression levels of p16 and RARbeta were determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Methylation-specific PCR was used to analyze their methylation status. WST-1 and flow cytometry were performed to detect growth inhibition, differentiation, apoptosis and cell cycle of U937 cells respectively. RESULTS: The expression p16 and RARbeta was down-regulated by promoter hypermethylation in newly diagnose delder AML patients and U937 cells. Combination treatment of ATRA and DAC induced DNA hypomethylation as well as gene expression of p16 and RARbeta, which contributed to the growth inhibition, differentiation, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of U937 cells. In addition for elder AML patients intolerable to standard chemotherapy, the combination regimen of ATRA and DAC showed antineoplastic activity accompamied by up-regulation of p16 and RARbeta expression and decrease of bone marrow blast, moreover the parients showed good tolerence to the reginen.

METHODS: One hundred and seventy patients diagnosed with AML (M1andM2) between December 2009 and December 2016 were included in the study. Bone marrow smears were prepared for morphologic alanalysis, the immunophenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry and the RHG-banding was for conventional cytogenetic assay (CCA) ,gene mutation was detected by sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 170 AMLpatients, 67 were diagnosed as M1 and 103 patients was diagnosed as M2, 43 patients(25.3%) defined as cuplike nuclei-positive, among them 38patients (88.4%) were M1 while only 5 patients (11.6%) were with M2(P<0.01). No significant value about sex(P> 0.05) between cuplike nuclei-positive and -negative group, while older patients were found in cuplike nuclei-positive group (P<0.05). Higher peroxydas (POX) ratio (P<0.05) and integration (P<0.05) were found in cuplike nuclei- positive group. Furthermore, the patients with cuplike nuclei-positive lack the expressions of CD34 (P<0.01) and HLA-DR(P<0.01) while no other immunophenotype markers were found. Among the 152 patients (89.4%) for genetic analysis ,83.8% karyotype of the cuplike nuclei-positive group were normal while only 54.8 of negative group was normal by CCA. Molecular biology analysis showed that the patients in cuplike nuclei-positive group have significantly highe rNMP1 (P<0.01) and FLT3(P<0.01) mutations as compared with the negative group. Furthermore, the relationship of the ratio o fcuplike nuclei and the type of gene mutations were investigated, and no significant associations were found. However, it was found that the patients with FLT3 mutation displayed more biological nuclear invagination than the patients with NPM1 mutations (P<0/01).

The aim of our study was to assess the health status of childhood ALL survivors after over 10 years of follow-up and to assess its relationships with gene polymorphisms, numbers and types of LEs, as well as with intensity of chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: We conducted a telephone survey in 125 ALL survivors (median time from completion of treatment was 12 years) and compared the results with those obtained in our previous study. Most of the patients were followed-up by local providers. RESULTS: The prevalence of LEs of approximately 50% was similar in both study groups. More than one LE was found in almost 25% of patients. Endocrine LEs were less frequent than in our previous study (44% vs 22%), probably due to underdiagnosis. The prevalence of hepatitis B/C decreased from 30%/50 to 18% (counted together), and prevalence of neurologic LEs decreased from 18 to 6%. The increase in the rate of second malignancies was not significant (2% vs. 3%). Sixty four percent of patients continued their education at the time of the study. Approximately 51% of ALL survivors who have completed their education by the time of the study had no permanent employment, including 4 mothers of infants and 3 persons qualified for a disability living allowance. These employment problems may have been due to cognitive impairment. The offspring of the ALL survivors included 11 children, all of them healthy. Further analysis showed higher prevalence of hepatitis in patients treated with CRT (p = 0.0001). Genetic studies revealed higher prevalence of hepatitis in patients homozygous for the rs9939609A variant of the FTO gene compared with other patients (p = 0.03). Moreover, wild-type rs1137101 polymorphism (Q223R) of the and leptin receptor gene was more frequent in patients with psychological LEs (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of LEs in ALL survivors is of key importance.

Rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, catabolizes uric acid. At our institution, we administer a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase to patients who are at risk for tumor lysis syndrome. We aimed to assess the efficacy of single 6-mg dose of rasburicase and explore risk factors associated with rasburicase failure. METHODS: We report results in 92 adult patients who had a baseline uric acid greater than 7.5 mg/dL and received a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase for the management of tumor lysis syndrome. Responders were defined as those whose uric acid was less than or equal to 7.5 mg/dL within 24-36 h of rasburicase administration. The primary end point was response based on uric acid level. Secondary end points included response to rasburicase in association with lactate dehydrogenase, serum creatinine, calcium, phosphorus, blood pH, and oncologic diagnosis. RESULTS: Median age was 65 years and 70% were men. Most patients had leukemia (32%) or lymphoma (40%). Eighty-seven of 92 patients (95%), who received single 6-mg dose of rasburicase, achieved a uric acid less than 7.5 mg/dL within 24-36h of dosing. Body mass index was similar between responders and non-responders: 28.6 kg/m(2) vs. 26.6 kg/m(2), respectively, p = 0.6. Baseline lactate dehydrogenase levels were similar between the groups: 756 U/L vs. 892 U/L, respectively, p = 0.33. Blood pH values documented within 24 h of first dose of rasburicase were also similar between the two groups (n = 30; 7.33 vs. 7.34 respectively, p = 0.6). However, median baseline uric acid was lower in responders than non-responders: 12.3 mg/dL vs. 17.3 mg/dL, respectively, p = 0.012. Baseline serum creatinine and creatinine clearance were similar between responders and non-responders (2.2 mg/dL vs. 3.95 mg/dL; p = 0.12 and 29 mL/min vs. 16 mL/min; p = 0.11, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Higher baseline uric acid levels were observed in patients who did not respond to the first rasburicase dose. In our study, uric acid levels normalized in 95% of patients after a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase indicating that a single 6-mg dose of rasburicase may be sufficient to manage tumor lysis syndrome, for most patients.",,"['Nauffal, Mary', 'Redd, Robert', 'Ni, Jian', 'Stone, Richard M', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'McDonnell, Anne M']","['Nauffal M', 'Redd R', 'Ni J', 'Stone RM', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'McDonnell AM']",,"[""1 Department of Pharmacy Services, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", '2 Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""1 Department of Pharmacy Services, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", '3 Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', '3 Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', ""1 Department of Pharmacy Services, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180815,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)', 'AYI8EX34EU (Creatinine)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Body Mass Index', 'Calcium/blood', 'Creatinine/blood', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hyperuricemia/blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Phosphorus/blood', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Uric Acid/*blood']",,['NOTNLM'],"['6 mg', 'Rasburicase', 'hyperuricemia', 'tumor lysis syndrome']",,2018/08/17 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155218791333 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Sep;25(6):1349-1356. doi: 10.1177/1078155218791333.

Survival from time of relapse is typically measured in weeks to months, and standard chemotherapy and currently approved targeted therapy achieve remission in less than a third of affected patients. To date, the only definitive curative therapy has been allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Advances in immunotherapy, with the introduction of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and the development of tisagenlecleucel, have changed the landscape. Areas covered: This review will describe the pharmacology of tisagenlecleucel and summarize the clinical evidence for its use in the treatment of multiple-relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL (B-ALL). Also discussed are other immunotherapies for B-ALL as well as the most commonly-encountered toxicities and corresponding management strategies. Expert commentary: Early phase trials indicate that tisagenlecleucel significantly improves survival for patients with B-ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse. In responding patients, remissions have been reported on the order of years, and thus, tisagenlecleucel may herald a dramatic shift in the treatment paradigm of this largely fatal disease.",,"['Leahy, Allison Barz', 'Elgarten, Caitlin W', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Teachey, David T']","['Leahy AB', 'Elgarten CW', 'Grupp SA', 'Maude SL', 'Teachey DT']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1368-4064'],"[""a Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA."", ""a Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA."", ""a Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA."", ""a Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA."", ""a Divisions of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology , Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania, Perelman School of Medicine , Philadelphia , PA , USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,England,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther,Expert review of anticancer therapy,101123358,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', 'Q6C9WHR03O (tisagenlecleucel)']",IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/administration & dosage/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CART', '*CD19', '*Kymriah', '*Tisagenlecleucel', '*chimeric antigen receptor T cell', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*immunotherapy', '*lymphoblastic leukemia']",,2018/08/17 06:00,2019/03/20 06:00,['2018/08/17 06:00'],"['2018/08/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14737140.2018.1512411 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Anticancer Ther. 2018 Oct;18(10):959-971. doi: 10.1080/14737140.2018.1512411.,10,959-971,"['T32 HD060550/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM075766/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review intends to provide an outline of the principal biological and molecular functions of mTOR.

This expectation predicts a positive correlation between body size and cancer risk; however, there is no correlation between body size and cancer risk across species (""Peto's paradox""). Here, we show that elephants and their extinct relatives (proboscideans) may have resolved Peto's paradox in part through refunctionalizing a leukemia inhibitory factor pseudogene (LIF6) with pro-apoptotic functions. LIF6 is transcriptionally upregulated by TP53 in response to DNA damage and translocates to the mitochondria where it induces apoptosis. Phylogenetic analyses of living and extinct proboscidean LIF6 genes indicates that its TP53 response element evolved coincident with the evolution of large body sizes in the proboscidean stem lineage. These results suggest that refunctionalizing of a pro-apoptotic LIF pseudogene may have been permissive (although not sufficient) for the evolution of large body sizes in proboscideans.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

We aimed to develop a model to identify leukemia patients with major hemorrhages within routinely recorded health records. METHODS: The model was developed using routinely recorded health records of a cohort of leukemia patients admitted to an academic hospital in the Netherlands between June 2011 and December 2015. Major hemorrhage was assessed by chart review. The model comprised CT-brain, hemoglobin drop, and transfusion need within 24 hours for which the best discriminating cut off values were taken. External validation was performed within a cohort of two other academic hospitals. RESULTS: The derivation cohort consisted of 255 patients, 10,638 hospitalization days, of which chart review was performed for 353 days. The incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.22 per 100 days in hospital. The model consisted of CT-brain (yes/no), hemoglobin drop of >/=0.8 g/dl and transfusion of >/=6 units. The C-statistic was 0.988 (CI 0.981-0.995). In the external validation cohort of 436 patients (19,188 days), the incidence of major hemorrhage was 0.46 per 100 hospitalization days and the C-statistic was 0.975 (CI 0.970-0.980). Presence of at least one indicator had a sensitivity of 100% (CI 95.8-100) and a specificity of 90.7% (CI 90.2-91.1). The number of days to screen to find one case decreased from 217.4 to 23.6. INTERPRETATION: A model based on information on CT-brain, hemoglobin drop and need of transfusions can accurately identify cases of major hemorrhage within routinely recorded health records.",,"['Kreuger, Aukje L', 'Middelburg, Rutger A', 'Beckers, Erik A M', 'de Vooght, Karen M K', 'Zwaginga, Jaap Jan', 'Kerkhoffs, Jean-Louis H', 'van der Bom, Johanna G']","['Kreuger AL', 'Middelburg RA', 'Beckers EAM', 'de Vooght KMK', 'Zwaginga JJ', 'Kerkhoffs JH', 'van der Bom JG']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1658-9257'],"['Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry and Haematology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Immunohaematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Haga Hospital, Den Haag, the Netherlands.', 'Center for Clinical Transfusion Research, Sanquin Research, Leiden, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180815,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Delivery of Health Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/*diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Records/*statistics & numerical data']",PMC6093651,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2018/08/16 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0200655 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-08539 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Aug 15;13(8):e0200655. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200655. eCollection 2018.,8,e0200655,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its flexibility as well as rising numbers of instrument vendors leads to suboptimal implementations of FCS in some cases. Such situations compromise the primary goal of the standard and hinder the ability to reproduce FCM analyses. It is further underlined by rapid rise of advanced FCM analyses, often carried out outside traditional software tools and heavily relying on standard data storage and presentation.

Dysregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in the endometria of women with RIF is involved in impaired endometrial receptivity and embryo adhesion. However, the mechanism through which LIF expression is regulated in women with RIF is still poorly understood. Our previous study noted that the abnormally increased endometrial Kruppel-like factor 12 (KLF12) in RIF women led to impaired decidualization and embryo implantation. Here, we further found that KLF12 inhibited embryo adhesion in vivo and in vitro by repressing LIF expression. Mechanistically, KLF12 bound to conserved sites (CAGTGGG, -6771 to -6765 and -7115 to -7109) within the LIF promoter region and repressed LIF transcription directly. Exogenous LIF significantly reversed the KLF12-mediated repression of BeWo spheroid adhesion. KLF12 expression was reduced significantly in Ishikawa cells treated with progestogen, which was due to the activation of Akt signaling.

Pyridine fusion to position 3,4 of the A-ring may dramatically enhance affinity of 17alpha-picolyl compounds for CYP17 while conferring selective antiproliferative activity against PC-3 cells. Similarly, pyridine fusion to the A-ring of steroidal d-homo lactones led to identification of new inhibitors of aldo-keto reductase 1C3, an enzyme targeted in acute myeloid leukemia, breast and prostate cancers. One A-pyridine d-lactone steroid 5 also has selective submicromolar antiproliferative activity against HT-29 colon cancer cells.

Thus, a number of compounds were prepared to assess the effect of the guanidinium/isouronium substitution on cancer cell growth; additionally, the molecular shortening and conformational change induced by replacing the di-substituted guanidine-linker of 1 by an amide was explored. The effect of these compounds on cell viability was tested in human leukaemia, breast cancer and cervical cancer cell lines and the resulting IC50 values were compared with those of the lead compound 1. Replacement of the di-substituted guanidine-linker by an amide results in the loss of cytotoxicity; however, substitution of the mono-substituted guanidinium by an isouronium cation seems to be beneficial for cell growth inhibition. Additionally, the effect of these compounds on the MAPK/ERK pathway was studied by means of Western blotting and the results indicate that the isouronium derivative 2 decreases the levels of phosphorylated, and thus activated, ERK (pERK) both in leukaemia and breast cancer cells, whereas lead compound 1 only shows an effect on pERK levels in breast cancer cells.

Moreover, CRK proteins are the major phosphorylation substrates of ABL kinase and its oncogenic mutant BCR-ABL kinase. The interaction between CRK and BCR-ABL plays important roles in chronic myeloid leukemia. Hence, inhibiting the interaction of CRK with BCR-ABL is an attractive way to attenuate cancer metastasis. Herein, we report the development of a peptide inhibitor, PRM-3, targeting the interaction between CRK-II and ABL kinase. PRM-3 binds to the N-terminal SH3 (nSH3) domain in CRK-II with a 10 nM affinity and prevents the interaction between CRK-II and ABL kinase. An in vitro biochemical assay demonstrated that PRM-3 inhibits the ABL-dependent phosphorylation of CRK-II more effectively than imatinib. Remarkably, PRM-3 also inhibited the CRK phosphorylation by T315I-ABL kinase, which is resistant to all first- and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Our study provides a promising alternative approach to overcome the drug resistance of ABL kinase.",,"['Shen, Qingliang', 'Bhatt, Veer S', 'Krieger, Inna', 'Sacchettini, James C', 'Cho, Jae-Hyun']","['Shen Q', 'Bhatt VS', 'Krieger I', 'Sacchettini JC', 'Cho JH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6190-6151'],"['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics , Texas A&M University , College Station , Texas , USA .

Clearly, this raises the need for novel therapeutics with new modes of action. Herein, we report on the favorable in vitro anti-proliferative properties of a phenanthridine-containing Re(I)(CO)3 complex (compound 1, also abbreviated LR-166) and identify major contributions to its mode of action. The complex induces apoptosis in low micromolar concentrations even in drug-resistant Burkitt-like lymphoma (BJAB) and leukemia (Nalm-6) cell lines with known overexpression of p-glycoproteins as was confirmed by measuring the amount of hypodiploid DNA via FACS Scan analysis. Importantly, a gene expression analysis in combination with toxicity studies on a number of modified cell lines (leukemia: NALM-6, lymphoma: BJAB, melanoma: MelHO) and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (determined by adding JC-1 dye, followed by FACS analysis) confirmed the activation of both, the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Finally, the mechanism of action was shown not to be influenced by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 in Mel-HO cells which are known to be resistant to a variety of drugs. All taken together, our experiments underscore the unique opportunities inherent in this novel lead structure of Re complexes to act as an effective chemotherapeutic agent in a combination therapy to overcome documented drug resistances in tumors.",,"['Konig, Marcel', 'Siegmund, Daniel', 'Raszeja, Lukasz J', 'Prokop, Aram', 'Metzler-Nolte, Nils']","['Konig M', 'Siegmund D', 'Raszeja LJ', 'Prokop A', 'Metzler-Nolte N']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2476-8965', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8111-9959']","[""Department of Paedriatic Oncology , Children's Hospital Cologne , Amsterdamer Strasse 59 , 50735 Cologne , Germany."", 'Chair of Inorganic Chemistry I - Bioinorganic Chemistry , Faculty of Chemistry and Biochemistry , Ruhr University Bochum , Universitatsstrasse 150 , D-44801 Bochum , Germany .

To address this question, we conducted a registry-based study of adults with acute myeloid leukemia in first or second complete remission who underwent allogeneic HCT between 1994 and 2013 from a sibling (N = 1600) or unrelated (N = 2113) donor matched at the antigen level for HLA-A, -B, and -DR. Preliminary analysis led us to focus on comparisons between the 1994-2006 and 2007-2013 periods. Significant improvement in survival was observed in the later cohort compared to the earlier cohort for unrelated HCT (P = 0.004), but not for related HCT (P = 0.767). The improvement in unrelated HCT was solely due to diminished non-relapse mortality (P = 0.001), while incidence of relapse did not change over time (P = 0.934). The percentage of patients receiving transplants from 8/8-matched unrelated donors was significantly higher in the later cohort (P < 0.001), and their survival was significantly better than that of those undergoing mismatched unrelated HCT (P = 0.022).

In the present study, we investigated whether ATG kills not only leukemic blasts but also leukemic stem cells (LSCs). We used a flow cytometric assay of complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CDC). ATG-induced death of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells from patients newly diagnosed with AML was measured among blasts as well as LSCs. At 10 mg/L ATG, blasts but not LSCs were killed. At 50 mg/L ATG, both blasts and LSCs were killed. We also measured ATG-mediated killing of healthy individuals' hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Median 2% HSCs from blood and 15% HSCs from filgrastim-mobilized grafts were killed with 50 mg/L ATG, compared to 30% LSCs from the blood of AML patients (p = 0.001 and 0.022, respectively).

METHODS: Cancer mortality and incidence were studied in relation to external radiation exposure in the National Registry for Radiation Workers. A cohort of 167,003 workers followed for an average of 32 years was analysed using Poisson regression methods. RESULTS: Mortality and incidence risks were significantly raised for the group of all malignant neoplasms excluding leukaemia (ERR/Sv mortality = 0.28; 90%CI: 0.06, 0.53, ERR/Sv incidence = 0.28; 90%CI: 0.10, 0.48) but with narrower confidence bounds compared with the previous analysis of this cohort reflecting the increased statistical power from the additional 10 years of follow-up information. The linear trends in relative risk for both mortality and incidence of these cancers remained statistically significantly raised when information relating to cumulative doses above 100 mSv was excluded (ERR/Sv mortality = 1.42; 90%CI: 0.51, 2.38 and ERR/Sv incidence = 1.18; 90%CI: 0.47, 1.92).

However, due to the complexity of traditional Chinese medicinal compounds, the pharmacological mechanism of Qingdai needs further research. In this study, we investigated the pharmacological mechanisms of Qingdai in the treatment of CML using network pharmacology approaches. First, components in Qingdai that were selected by pharmacokinetic profiles and biological activity predicted putative targets based on a combination of 2D and 3D similarity measures with known ligands. Then, an interaction network of Qingdai putative targets and known therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia was constructed. By calculating the 4 topological features (degree, betweenness, closeness, and coreness) of each node in the network, we identified the candidate Qingdai targets according to their network topological importance. The composite compounds of Qingdai and the corresponding candidate major targets were further validated by a molecular docking simulation. Seven components in Qingdai were selected and 32 candidate Qingdai targets were identified; these were more frequently involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and immune system-related pathways, which all play important roles in the progression of CML. Finally, the molecular docking simulation showed that 23 pairs of chemical components and candidate Qingdai targets had effective binding. This network-based pharmacology study suggests that Qingdai acts through the regulation of candidate targets to interfere with CML and thus regulates the occurrence and development of CML.",,"['Li, Huayao', 'Liu, Lijuan', 'Liu, Cun', 'Zhuang, Jing', 'Zhou, Chao', 'Yang, Jing', 'Gao, Chundi', 'Liu, Gongxi', 'Lv, Qingliang', 'Sun, Changgang']","['Li H', 'Liu L', 'Liu C', 'Zhuang J', 'Zhou C', 'Yang J', 'Gao C', 'Liu G', 'Lv Q', 'Sun C']",,"['College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Departmen of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Departmen of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Departmen of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, China (mainland).', 'Departmen of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).', ""Department of Interventional Radiology, Weifang People's Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland)."", 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180815,United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', 'R1R8QUL21Z (Qingdai compound)']",IM,"['Drugs, Chinese Herbal/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC6106618,,,,2018/08/16 06:00,2018/11/20 06:00,['2018/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['908756 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.908756 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2018 Aug 15;24:5668-5688. doi: 10.12659/MSM.908756.,,5668-5688,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review will summarize the key areas of progress in the use of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and nontransplant immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of aplastic anemia and then summarize the recommendations for first-line treatment. Based on recent data, we argue that guidelines for the initial treatment of patients with newly diagnosed severe aplastic anemia require revision. At the time of diagnosis, before beginning treatment, HLA typing should be done to identify a marrow donor among family members or in the unrelated donor registries, and a marrow transplant should be considered first-line therapy. The priority order of donor source for bone marrow transplantation is: (1) HLA-identical sibling, (2) HLA-matched unrelated donor, and (3) HLA-haploidentical donor if an HLA-matched unrelated donor is not rapidly available. Each of these donor marrow sources may be preferable to nontransplant IST. We make this recommendation because of the long-term persistent risk for disease relapse and secondary myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia with the use of nontransplant IST for patients with aplastic anemia. In contrast, marrow transplantation is associated with high cure rates of aplastic anemia and a relatively low risk for graft-versus-host disease, with many patients now living for decades without the risk for disease recurrence or the development of clonal disorders. Implementation of this first-line treatment strategy will provide patients with severe aplastic anemia the best chance of long-term disease-free survival.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Georges, George E', 'Doney, Kris', 'Storb, Rainer']","['Georges GE', 'Doney K', 'Storb R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0625-0858', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5525-3748', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9343-4099']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Allografts', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/pathology/*therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Donor Selection', '*Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', '*Unrelated Donors']",PMC6093726,,,,2018/08/16 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/08/16 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018021162 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018021162 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Aug 14;2(15):2020-2028. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018021162.,15,2020-2028,"['P01 HL122173/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA015704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL125183/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistent allelic burden after chemotherapy is associated with higher relapse incidence, but presence of allelic burden in AML patients after receiving allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has not been examined longitudinally. As such, we aimed to assess the feasibility of NGS in monitoring AML patients receiving HCT. Using a targeted gene panel, we performed NGS in 104 AML patients receiving HCT using samples collected at diagnosis, pre-HCT, and post-HCT at day 21 (post-HCT(D21)). NGS detected 256 mutations in 90 of 104 patients at diagnosis, which showed stepwise clearances after chemotherapy and HCT. In a subset of patients, mutations were still detectable pre-HCT and post-HCT. Most post-HCT mutations originate from mutations initially detected at diagnosis. Post-HCT(D21) allelic burdens in relapsed patients were higher than in nonrelapsed patients. Post-HCT(D21) mutations in relapsed patients all expanded at relapse. Assessment of variant allele frequency (VAF) revealed that overall VAF post-HCT(D21) (VAF(0.2%)-post-HCT(D21)) is associated with an increased risk of relapse (56.2% vs 16.0% at 3 years; P < .001) and worse overall survival (OS; 36.5% vs 67.0% at 3 years; P = .006). Multivariate analyses confirmed that VAF(0.2%)-post-HCT(D21) is an adverse prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.07; P = .003) and relapse incidence (HR, 4.75; P < .001), independent of the revised European LeukemiaNet risk groups. Overall, current study demonstrates that NGS-based posttransplant monitoring in AML patients is feasible and can distinguish high-risk patients for relapse.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Kim, TaeHyung', 'Moon, Joon Ho', 'Ahn, Jae-Sook', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Lee, Seung-Shin', 'Ahn, Seo-Yeon', 'Jung, Sung-Hoon', 'Yang, Deok-Hwan', 'Lee, Je-Jung', 'Choi, Seung Hyun', 'Lee, Ja-Yeon', 'Tyndel, Marc S', 'Shin, Myung-Geun', 'Lee, Yoo Jin', 'Sohn, Sang Kyun', 'Park, Seong-Kyu', 'Zhang, Zhaolei', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Dennis Dong Hwan']","['Kim T', 'Moon JH', 'Ahn JS', 'Kim YK', 'Lee SS', 'Ahn SY', 'Jung SH', 'Yang DH', 'Lee JJ', 'Choi SH', 'Lee JY', 'Tyndel MS', 'Shin MG', 'Lee YJ', 'Sohn SK', 'Park SK', 'Zhang Z', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim DDH']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3756-796X'],"['Department of Computer Science and.', 'The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Kyungpook National University Hospital, School of Medicine, Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology and.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'Genomic Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Jeollanam-do, Republic of Korea.', 'The Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'The Edward S.

TIM-3 is expressed on leukemic stem cells (LSCs) in most types of AML and might have a positive effect on maintenance of malignant phenotype. MicroRNAs play important roles in either cancer progression or suppression. In this study were evaluated, the inhibitory effect of miR-498 on TIM-3 expression and its impact on proliferation and survival of HL-60 cell line. METHODS: Firstly, the probable inhibitory effect of miR-498 on TIM-3 expression was predicted. HL-60 cells were cultured and expression of TIM-3 was induced on the cells using phorbol miristate acetate. The cells were transfected with miR-498 and expression level of TIM-3 were measured using with q-RT-PCR and flow cytometry methods. In addition, the effect of suppression of TIM-3 expression in HL-60 cell line was analyzed with apoptosis and cell proliferation assays. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analyses predicted that miR-498 has high ability to silence TIM-3 gene expression. Our experiments confirmed that miR-498 was able to strongly silence TIM-3 expression (68% silencing) in HL-60 cell line (P < 0.002). Also, the cells with suppressed expression of TIM-3 had a lower proliferation and higher apoptosis rates. CONCLUSION: Based on our results, the miR-498 can effectively suppress TIM-3 expression in the AML cell line. TIM-3 suppression, in turn, inhibits malignant cell proliferation and induces its apoptosis. Collectively, suppression of TIM-3 by miR-498 can be considered as a potential powerful way for treatment of AML.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

Methods: Data of death for Chinese adolescents aged 10-19 years were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 (GBD 2016). The data was used to describe the change in mortality of Chinese adolescents from 1990 to 2016.Top 15 causes of death were compared between 1990 and 2016. Results: From 1990 to 2016, the all-cause mortality of Chinese adolescents aged 10-19 years old dropped from 102.5/100 000 to 41.2/100 000, reaching about a half of the global average (78.6/100 000) but still almost twice as high as the average of high-income countries (24.3/100 000) by 2016; the reduction in mortality was higher among females than that among males (decreased 68.7% vs. 54.7%), and among adolescents aged 10-14 years than that among those aged 15-19 years (decreased 62.1% vs. 57.1%). During the 26-year period, the cause-specific mortality of all top 15 causes saw sharp decreases. Among them, communicable, maternal, and nutritional diseases saw the most significant decrease (78.1%), and its proportion in all adolescent deaths fell from 11.1% to 6.1%. Meanwhile, non-communicable diseases and injuries saw relatively small decreases (58.2% and 57.3% respectively), and their proportions rose from 33.4% and 55.6% to 34.8% and 59.1%, respectively. The top 5 causes of death changed from drowning (17.39/100 000 in mortality, 17.0% in proportion), road injuries (14.77/100 000, 14.4%), self-harm (11.44/100 000, 11.2%), leukemia (5.48/100 000, 5.4%) and interpersonal violence (3.12/100 000, 3.0%) in1990 into road injuries (9.27/100 000, 22.5%), drowning (6.83/100 000, 16.6%), leukemia(2.73/100 000, 6.6%), self-harm (2.53/100 000, 6.2%) and congenital birth defects (1.76/100 000, 4.3%) in 2016, and tuberculosis, poisonings and rheumatic heart disease had dropped out of the top 15 in 2016. Conclusion: The mortality of Chinese adolescents aged 10-19 years has decreased significantly, but still higher than developed countries.

To identify the relationship between ALV-J host range and the polymorphism of its cellular receptors, we performed a wide range epidemiological investigation of current ALV-J infection in Chinese local chickens, and discovered that all the 18 local chicken breeds being investigated from main local chicken breeding provinces were ALV-J positive. Furthermore, we cloned ALV-J cellular receptor genes of chNHE1 and chANXA2 of these 18 chicken breeds. Sequence alignment demonstrated that despite several regular mutations at the nucleotide level, there were no corresponding amino acid mutations for either chNHE1 gene or chANXA2 gene. Additionally, virus entry assay indicated that the level of viral enter into cells is stable among different chicken breeds.

Several different 5' RACE methods have been developed, and one particularly simple and efficient approach called CapFinder relies on the 5' cap-dependent template-switching that occurs in eukaryotes. However, most prokaryotic transcripts lack a 5' cap structure. Here, we report a procedure to capture primary transcripts based on capping the 5' triphosphorylated RNA in prokaryotes. Primary transcripts were first treated with vaccinia capping enzyme to add a 5' cap structure. First-strand cDNA was then synthesized using Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase. Finally, a template-switching oligonucleotide with a tail containing three ribonucleic acid guanines was hybridized to the cDNA 3' poly(C) and further used as template for reverse transcriptase. It is oligonucleotide sequence independent and is more sensitive compared to RLM-RACE. This approach specifically identified the transcription start sites of ompA, sodB and shiA in Escherichia coli and of ompA, rne and rppH in Brucella melitensis. Furthermore, we also successfully identified the transcription start sites of small noncoding genes ryhB and micC in E. coli and bsnc135 and bsnc149 in B. melitensis.

These cytotoxic and mutagenic effects mainly occur in proliferating cells. Repair mechanisms may prevent DNA damage in quiescent cells, but they may be insufficient to contrast the side effects of cyclophosphamide if high doses of the drug are used. Most adverse events are dose- and age-dependent. Phosphoramide mustard can cause bone marrow toxicity, gonadal toxicity, and may favor the development of leukemia, bladder cancer and other types of malignancy. Acrolein can produce hemorrhagic cystitis and even bladder fibrosis when given for prolonged periods. A number of precautional measures should be taken to prevent these untoward events. In particular, long-term administration and high doses of cyclophosphamide should be avoided whenever possible. Today the indications to cyclophosphamide in glomerular diseases are more restricted than in the past, but the drug is still used as a steroid-sparing agent in steroid-sensitive minimal change disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. In membranous nephropathy, cyclophosphamide, alternated or associated with corticosteroids, proved to be beneficial in obtaining remission of nephrotic syndrome and preserving renal function. Cyclophosphamide is considered as a first-line treatment for rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and the hectic phases of lupus nephritis. In conclusion, cyclophosphamide is a cheap drug that may be useful in a number of glomerular diseases but it may lead to severe side effects. A close monitoring of blood count and clinical conditions, as well as low cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide are strongly recommended when using the drug in patients with renal diseases.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

USP10 belongs to a protein family that deubiquitinates a distinct set of target proteins, and thus, increases the steady state protein levels of its target subproteome. One of the USP10 targets is TP53. Wildtype TP53 is usually rescued from proteasomal degradation by USP10. As most KMT2A leukemias display wildtype p53 alleles, one might argue that the disruption of an USP10 allele can be classified as a pro-oncogenic event.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Zerkalenkova, Elena', 'Lebedeva, Svetlana', 'Kazakova, Anna', 'Baryshev, Pavel', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Novichkova, Galina', 'Maschan, Michael', 'Maschan, Aleksey', 'Olshanskaya, Yulia']","['Zerkalenkova E', 'Lebedeva S', 'Kazakova A', 'Baryshev P', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Novichkova G', 'Maschan M', 'Maschan A', 'Olshanskaya Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9634-5828'],"['Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Faculty of Fundamental Medicine, Lomonosov Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia (DCAL), Biocenter, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia (DCAL), Biocenter, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics, Dmitry Rogachev Research and Clinical Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180814,United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (USP10 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*FISH', '*LDI-PCR', '*MLL/KMT2A', '*acute myeloblastic leukaemia', '*cytogenetics']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2018/10/26 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22646 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2018 Oct;57(10):522-524. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22646.

New interventions based on novel targets are needed. We aim to identify new genetic determinants of overall survival (OS) in patients after treatment with gemcitabine using genome-wide screens of germline DNA. We aim also to support these findings with in vitro functional analysis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Genome-wide screens of germline DNA in two independent cohorts of pancreatic cancer patients (from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 80303 and the Mayo Clinic) were used to select new genes associated with OS. The vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) was selected, and the interactions of genetic variation in VDR with circulating vitamin D levels and gemcitabine treatment were evaluated. Functional effects of common VDR variants were also evaluated in experimental assays in human cell lines. RESULTS: The rs2853564 variant in VDR was associated with OS in patients from both the Mayo Clinic (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.70-0.94, p = 0.0059) and CALGB 80303 (HR 0.74, 0.63-0.87, p = 0.0002). rs2853564 interacted with high pre-treatment levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D, a measure of endogenous vitamin D) (p = 0.0079 for interaction) and with gemcitabine treatment (p = 0.024 for interaction) to confer increased OS. rs2853564 increased transcriptional activity in luciferase assays and reduced the binding of the IRF4 transcription factor. CONCLUSION: Our findings propose VDR as a novel determinant of survival in advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Common functional variation in this gene might interact with endogenous vitamin D and gemcitabine treatment to determine improved patient survival. These results support evidence for a modulatory role of the vitamin D pathway for the survival of advanced pancreatic cancer patients.",,"['Innocenti, Federico', 'Owzar, Kouros', 'Jiang, Chen',

Our previous studies designed a series of HH inhibitors with novel scaffolds distinctive from vismodegib, the first Food and Drug Administration-approved HH inhibitor for the treatment of basal-cell carcinoma and medulloblastoma. In the present study, we evaluated these HH inhibitors against blood cancers and found that HH78 displayed potent activity in suppressing the HH signaling pathway. HH78 competitively bound to SMO and suppressed the transcriptional activity of GLI by the luciferase reporter gene assay and the measurement of HH/SMO-downregulated genes, including cyclin D2, cyclin E, PTCH1, PTCH2, and GLI. HH78 at low micromolar concentrations induced significant cancer cell apoptosis showed by increased caspase-3 activation, annexin V-staining and downregulated prosurvival proteins, including c-Myc, Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xL. In contrast, vismodegib did not show any effects on these apoptotic events. HH78 also suppressed the activation of the AKT/mTOR pathway, which cross-talks with the HH/SMO pathway. Finally, HH78 inhibited the growth of human leukemia K562 in nude mice xenografts with no overt toxicity. Collectively, the present study identified a novel HH inhibitor with great potential for the treatment of hematological malignancies.",,"['Lin, Peng', 'He, Yuanming', 'Chen, Guodong', 'Ma, Haikuo', 'Zheng, Jiyue', 'Zhang, Zubin', 'Cao, Biyin', 'Zhang, Hongjian', 'Zhang, Xiaohu', 'Mao, Xinliang']","['Lin P', 'He Y', 'Chen G', 'Ma H', 'Zheng J', 'Zhang Z', 'Cao B', 'Zhang H', 'Zhang X', 'Mao X']",,"['Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', 'Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou.', ""Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,"['0 (Anilides)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (HhAntag691)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (SMO protein, human)', '0 (Smoothened Receptor)']",IM,"['Anilides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Down-Regulation/genetics', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Smoothened Receptor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000679 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2018 Nov;29(10):995-1003. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000679.,10,995-1003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-renewal, quiescence, and chemotherapy resistance are key stemness properties of LSCs that are essential for poor clinical responses to conventional therapies. Identifying LSC surface markers and targeting LSCs are important for the development of potential therapies. In this study, application of chemotherapy treatment in AML-ETO9a (AE9a) leukemia mice led to the enrichment of a chemotherapy-resistant cell population identified as Lin(-) c-Kit(+) c-MPL(+) . In addition, this c-MPL-positive cell population within Lin(-) c-Kit(+) leukemia cells included a high percentage of cells in a quiescent state, enhanced colony formation ability, and increased homing efficiency. Serial transplantation demonstrated that Lin(-) c-Kit(+) c-MPL(+) cells displayed a significantly high potential for leukemia initiation. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that in AML patients, c-MPL was expressed on the majority of CD34(+) leukemia cells and that the proportion of c-MPL(+) cells in CD34(+) leukemia cells is associated with poor prognosis. Finally, AMM2, an inhibitor of c-MPL, was shown to significantly enhance the survival of AE9a leukemia mice when combined with chemotherapeutic agent. These results indicate that c-MPL is a candidate LSC surface marker that may serve as a therapeutic target for the elimination of LSCs.

We investigated the interaction between leukaemic mesenchymal niche and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) using the model of Fanconi anaemia (FA), a genetic disorder characterized by BM failure and leukaemia. Healthy donor HSPCs co-cultured on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) derived from FA patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) exhibited higher human engraftment and myeloid expansion in Non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency IL-2gamma(-/-) /SGM3 recipients. Untargeted metabolomics analysis revealed the progressively elevated prostaglandins (PGs) in the MSCs of FA patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and AML. Reduced secretion of PGs subsequent to inflammatory cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) inhibition ameliorated HSPC/myeloid expansion. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated dysregulation of genes involved in the NR4A family of transcription factors (TFs) and WNT/beta-catenin signalling pathway in FA-AML-MSC-co-cultured-CD34(+) cells.

Since microRNAs (miRs) can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in human cancer, and miR34b has been reported to act as a tumor suppressor, the role of miR34b in Ewing's sarcoma was investigated in the present study. The results demonstrated that miR34b expression levels were higher in tumor samples compared within normal tissue samples. Notably, miR34b expression levels were significantly higher in EWSFLI1positive samples compared within EWSFLI1negative samples. The effects of miR34b expression on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were also examined. miR34b expression was inhibited using small interfering (si)RNA targeting the fusion gene. Transfection of a miR34b precursor sequence into siRNAtreated tumor cells resulted in a significant increase in cell growth, migration and invasion compared within the control group. In addition, the adhesive ability was increased in the Ewing's sarcoma cell line RDES, but not A673, following miR34b upregulation. Conversely, downregulation of miR34b expression led to a significant decrease in cell growth, migration and invasion.

However, genome-scale molecular characteristics to distinguish between diffuse (DF) and intestinal (IT) GC remain incompletely characterized, particularly at the transcriptional regulatory level. In the present study, gene regulatory networks were constructed using the Passing Attributes between Networks for Data Assimilation (PANDA) algorithm for DF, IT and mixed GC. The results indicated that >85% of transcription factor (TF)-target edges were shared among all three GC subtypes. In TF enrichment analysis, 13 TFs, including nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYA) and forkhead box L1, were activated in DF GC, whereas 8 TFs, including RELA proto-oncogene and T-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (TLX1), were activated in IT GC. Out of these identified TFs, NFYA [Hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval, CI)=0.560 (0.349, 0.900), P=0.017] and sex determining region Y [HR (95% CI)=0.603 (0.375, 0.969), P=0.037] were identified as independent prognostic factors in DF GC, but not in IT GC, whereas TLX1 [HR (95% CI)=0.547 (0.321, 0.9325), P=0.027] was identified as an independent prognostic factor in IT GC, but not in DF GC. Verification at the cellular level was also performed; interference of NFYA expression using small interfering RNA in MGC803 cells (DF GC-derived cells) markedly inhibited cell growth and colony formation. Similar effects were also detected in SGC-7901 cells (IT GC-derived cells), but to a lesser extent. In conclusion, identified gene regulatory networks differed between distinct GC subtypes, in which the same TFs had different biological effects.

A recent study has reported that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNPK) regulated autophagy in leukemia cells. However, the underlying mechanism of this remains elusive. The present study assessed the role of hnRNPK in the autophagy of the 293 cell line and investigated the associated molecular mechanisms of this. It was revealed that hnRNPK-knockdown with siRNA or the CRISPR-Cas9 system could increase the level of autophagy, while hnRNPK-overexpression exerted the opposite effect in 293 cells under normal nutrient conditions. By contrast, hnRNPK-knockdown or -overexpression had no effect on serum starvation- or rapamycin-induced autophagy. Therefore, hnRNPK was likely involved in the late stage of autophagy rather than the early stage. Furthermore, it was observed that hnRNPK deficiency led to the decrease in alpha-tubulin K40 acetylation in hnRNPK single allele knockout (hnRNPK+/-) cells. In accordance with this result, it was revealed that the mRNA and protein levels of histone deacetylas 6 (HDAC6) were upregulated in hnRNPK+/- cells compared with the wild-type cells. As a consequence, autophagosome-lysosome fusion in hnRNPK+/- cells was significantly enhanced and could be effectively suppressed by treatment with the selective inhibitor of HDAC6, tubastatin A (Tub A). Furthermore, prominent co-localization of ubiquitin-positive aggregates with LC3-positive autophagosomes was observed in hnRNPK+/- cells, but not in the wild-type or hnRNPK+/- cells treated with Tub A. Taken together, these results suggested that hnRNPK may regulate basal autophagy through modulating the expression level of HDAC6 to influence the autophagosome-lysosome fusion.",,"['Li, Zhipeng', 'Liu, Xiaohui', 'Ma, Jie', 'Zhang, Tingting', 'Gao, Xuejuan', 'Liu, Langxia']","['Li Z', 'Liu X', 'Ma J', 'Zhang T', 'Gao X', 'Liu L']",,"['Key Laboratory of Functional Protein Research of Guangdong Higher Education Institute, Institute of Life and Health Engineering, College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510632, P.R.

MicroRNA21 (miR21) is overexpressed and exhibits oncogenic activity in cancer. However, the biological mechanism underlying the effect of miR21 in AML remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the expression levels of miR21 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined in 26 patients with AML and 28 healthy individuals. The secretion of VEGF was also measured following the transfection of THP1 cells with miR21 mimic or inhibitor. The supernatants of the THP1 cells, which were transfected with miR21 mimic, inhibitor or small interfering RNA (si)VEGF, respectively, were used to incubate human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), following which tube formation of the HUVECs was measured. miR21 targets were predicted using a biological target prediction website and confirmed using a luciferase assay. The effects of interleukin (IL)12 were investigated by examining the tube formation of HUVECs and the secretion of VEGF following recombinant human (rh) IL12 pretreatment. The results revealed that miR21 and VEGF expression was significantly increased in the peripheral blood monocytes of the patients, compared with the healthy controls. There was negative correlation between the expression of IL12 and miR21 in the serum of patients with AML. Furthermore, supernatant VEGF levels from the miR21 mimictransfected THP1 cells were increased, whereas a decreasing trend was observed in the miR21 inhibitor group. The angiogenic ability of the HUVECs pretreated with supernatant from the THP1 cells transfected with miR21 mimic was higher, and was lower in THP1 cells cotransfected with miR21 mimic and siVEGF, compared with the miR21 mimic only group. A luciferase assay demonstrated that IL12 was the direct target of miR21, and the level of IL12 in the supernatant of THP1 cells transfected with miR21 mimic was increased. IL12 pretreatment increased VEGF expression and angiogenic ability in HUVECs.

The outcome of AML patients could thus be dependent on their nutritional status that can be evaluated by the simple measurement of serum albumin (SA) and body mass index (BMI). These two parameters could have a value as prognostic factors to guide patients' management. We evaluated the association between SA levels, BMI, and survival, evaluated as overall survival (OS) and event-free survival. Furthermore, we investigated the association between BMI, SA, and other prognostic factors of interest in AML. This retrospective single-center study included 159 patients diagnosed with AML at Nancy Hospital between 2005 and 2013, treated with aracytine and anthracycline. Forty-four percent of patients presented with normal weight while 56% were obese/overweight. Serum albumin levels were <30 g/L for 49 patients, and >/=30 g/L for 110. Thirty-four patients with low SA levels were also obese. Favourable OS was associated with SA levels >/=30 g/L (HR = 0.467; 95% CI 0.230-0.946; P = .034) but was not impacted by the BMI. Serum albumin levels appear to be an independent prognostic factor in AML and a better parameter than BMI for evaluating the nutritional status of patients at diagnosis.","['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Filliatre-Clement, Lauriane', 'Broseus, Julien', 'Muller, Marc', 'Hosseini, Kossar', 'Rotonda, Christine', 'Schirmer, Luciane', 'Roth-Guepin, Gabrielle', 'Bonmati, Caroline', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Bene, Marie-Christine', 'Perrot, Aurore']","['Filliatre-Clement L', 'Broseus J', 'Muller M', 'Hosseini K', 'Rotonda C', 'Schirmer L', 'Roth-Guepin G', 'Bonmati C', 'Feugier P', 'Bene MC', 'Perrot A']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5758-9034', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6569-7414', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0131-8689']","['Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Biology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'INSERM U 1256, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Genetics Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Platform of Clinical Research Support PARC, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'EA 4360 APEMAC, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'Hematology Biology Department, Nantes University Hospital, Nantes, France.', 'Hematology Department, Nancy University Hospital, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.', 'INSERM U 1256, Lorraine University, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20181005,England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Serum Albumin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers', '*Body Mass Index', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nutritional Status', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Serum Albumin', 'Survival Analysis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloblastic leukaemia', 'body mass index', 'serum albumin']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/03/06 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2543 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Feb;37(1):80-84. doi: 10.1002/hon.2543.

Following the recently revised World Health Organization criteria, we retrospectively reviewed 125 patients who were referred to us to exclude a neoplastic cause of HE (2003-2016). The clinical laboratory work-up confirmed secondary HE in 25 (20%) patients; myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with rearrangements of PDGFRA (n = 9) or PDGFRB (n = 2) (9%); HE associated with a well-defined myeloid neoplasm in 8 (6%); and abnormal bone marrow and/or molecular genetic abnormalities consistent with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), not otherwise specified (NOS) in 21 (17%) patients. For the remaining 60 (48%) patients, a specific diagnosis was not identified, and 56 patients had HE related findings consistent with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), while 4 patients who were asymptomatic. With a median follow up of 35.3 months (range, <1-104), patients with CEL, not otherwise specified (NOS) had a median OS of 26.1 months, significantly inferior to patients with idiopathic HES (not reached, P < .01). Thus, our experience in a single tertiary cancer center shows that the work-up of HE following WHO recommendations requires a multimodality-based approach; and a correct diagnosis determines risk stratification and proper patient management. However, the causes of HE remain unknown in approximately half of referred patients, indicating the need for further studies.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Hu, Zhihong', 'Boddu, Prajwal C', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Miranda, Roberto N', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Tam, Wayne', 'Orazi, Attilio', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Hu Z', 'Boddu PC', 'Loghavi S', 'Miranda RN', 'Goswami M', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Tam W', 'Orazi A', 'Verstovsek S', 'Wang SA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8809-6729', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9408-5882']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas Health Center at Houston, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York City, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York City, New York.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180926,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['Pdgfra-Associated Chronic Eosinophilic Leukemia'],,"['Adult', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Hypereosinophilic Syndrome/complications/*diagnosis/etiology/mortality', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate']",,,,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/06/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25247 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1337-1346. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25247.

Previous studies have reported that wogonoside could inhibit the progression of AML and suppress angiogenesis in a solid tumor, but the correlation of these two effects was ignored. In this research, we determined whether wogonoside could inhibit angiogenesis in this hematologic malignancy. We found that wogonoside could inhibit tumor growth and progression, and prolong the survival of nude mice inoculated with U937/MDR. Besides, reducing BM angiogenesis might cause therapeutic effect against resistant AML. Therefore, coculture between AML cells and BM stromal cells was established to imitate their crosstalk. Then, the effect of wogonoside on BM angiogenesis was tested in vitro and in vivo. We found that wogonoside could suppress microvessel formation in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay model and matrigel plug assay. The mechanism research revealed that wogonoside could block the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in AML cells and stromal cells to break their positive feedback. We detected several cytokines related to AML or angiogenesis and found that secreted interleukin-8 was a significant angiogenic cytokine to induce BM angiogenesis. These findings supported that new diagnostics and promising treatment strategies could be developed in relapsed and resistant AML patients.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lin, Binyan', 'Zhao, Kai', 'Yang, Dawei', 'Bai, Dongsheng', 'Liao, Yan', 'Zhou, Yuxin', 'Yu, Zhou', 'Yu, Xiaoxuan', 'Guo, Qinglong', 'Lu, Na']","['Lin B', 'Zhao K', 'Yang D', 'Bai D', 'Liao Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Yu Z', 'Yu X', 'Guo Q', 'Lu N']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5165-2592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4981-5281']","['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, Department of Basic Medicine, School of Basic Medicine and Clinical Pharmacy, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180813,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (CXCL8 protein, human)', '0 (Flavanones)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'ETX4944Z3R (wogonoside)']",IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chorioallantoic Membrane/blood supply', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Female', 'Flavanones/*pharmacology', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/drug effects', 'Paracrine Communication/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stromal Cells/*drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*STAT3', '*acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', '*bone marrow (BM) angiogenesis', '*interleukin-8 (IL-8)', '*wogonoside']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.27067 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2019 Feb;234(2):1913-1924. doi: 10.1002/jcp.27067.

Primary indications for splenectomy were refractory thrombocytopenia (36%), progressive spleen related symptoms (33%), emergent splenectomy for splenic rupture (21%), refractory anemia (8%), and prior to allogeneic stem cell transplant (3%). Eleven (28%) patients had anemia at the time of splenectomy, of which 3 (27%) were autoimmune. The median time to splenectomy from CMML diagnosis was 6 months (0-40); perioperative morbidity and mortality rates were 43% and 13%, while the median postsplenectomy survival was 25 months (11-38). Durable remission in spleen related symptoms, thrombocytopenia, complications from splenic rupture, and anemia were achieved in 85%, 50%, 62%, and 21% of patients, respectively. Perioperative morbidity (n = 30) included infections/sepsis in 6 (20%), intraabdominal bleeding in 4 (13%), venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 3 (10%), and acute lung injury in 2 (7%) patients. The median duration of hospital stay was 6 days (1-25), with 5 deaths occurring secondary to respiratory failure (n = 2), multiorgan dysfunction (n = 2) and hemorrhagic shock (n = 1). There was no difference in overall survival between CMML patients that underwent splenectomy, in comparison to those that did not. Unlike in myelofibrosis, portal hypertension was not an indication for splenectomy and no patients developed post-splenectomy thrombocytosis. In conclusion, apart from being a lifesaving emergent modality in the event of splenic rupture, splenectomy has an important palliative role in patients with CMML, with significant and durable improvements in spleen related symptoms and refractory cytopenias.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Pophali, Prateek', 'Horna, Pedro', 'Lasho, Terra L', 'Finke, Christy M', 'Ketterling, Rhett P', 'Gangat, Naseema', 'Nagorney, David', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Patnaik, Mrinal M']","['Pophali P', 'Horna P', 'Lasho TL', 'Finke CM', 'Ketterling RP', 'Gangat N', 'Nagorney D', 'Tefferi A', 'Patnaik MM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9104-6172', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4605-3821', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6998-662X']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematopathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of General Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20181005,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,,"['Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/complications/mortality/*surgery', 'Male', 'Palliative Care', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Splenectomy', 'Splenic Diseases/etiology/surgery', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time-to-Treatment', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6196105,,,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25246 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1347-1357. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25246.

Although some recent studies suggest that the obesity-related SNPs in FTO influence obesity susceptibility likely through altering the expression of the adjacent genes such as IRX3 and RPGRIP1L, rather than FTO itself, a solid link between the SNP risk genotype and the increased FTO expression in both human blood cells and fibroblasts has been reported. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence have demonstrated that FTO does play a critical role in the regulation of fat mass, adipogenesis, and body weight. Epidemiology studies also showed a strong association of FTO SNPs and overweight/obesity with increased risk of various types of cancers. As the first identified messenger RNA N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) demethylase, FTO has been shown recently to play m(6)A-dependent roles in adipogenesis and tumorigenesis (especially in the development of leukemia and glioblastoma). Given the critical roles of FTO in cancers, the development of selective and effective inhibitors targeting FTO holds potential to treat cancers. This mini review discusses the roles and underlying molecular mechanisms of FTO in both obesity and cancers, and also summarizes recent advances in the development of FTO inhibitors.",,"['Deng, Xiaolan', 'Su, Rui', 'Stanford, Savanna', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Deng X', 'Su R', 'Stanford S', 'Chen J']",,"['Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Monrovia, CA, United States.', 'School of Pharmacy China Medical University, Shenyang, China.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Monrovia, CA, United States.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Monrovia, CA, United States.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope Monrovia, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180730,Switzerland,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),Frontiers in endocrinology,101555782,,,,PMC6077364,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FTO inhibitors', 'GBM', 'cancer', 'fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO)', 'm6A demethylase', 'mRNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A)', 'obesity']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2018/08/15 06:01,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/05/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fendo.2018.00396 [doi]'],epublish,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne). 2018 Jul 30;9:396. doi: 10.3389/fendo.2018.00396. eCollection 2018.,,396,"['R01 CA178454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA211614/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA214965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aiming for discovery of a novel anti-inflammatory compound, we isolated spinacetin from the extract and investigated its in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory effect and the related mechanism. Effect of spinacetin on the Syk signaling pathway was studied in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs), and that on the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was investigated in Rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells and human mast cell line (HMC-1). The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity was assessed with passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction assay. Spinacetin significantly inhibited the release of histamine, and production of inflammatory mediators such as leukotriene C4 (LTC4) and interlukin-6 (IL-6) in IgE/Ag stimulated BMMCs. Analysis of the signaling pathways demonstrated that spinacetin inhibited activation of Syk, linker of activated T cells (LAT), phospholipase Cgamma (PLCgamma), cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), MAPKs, Akt/NF-kappaB, and intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization but with no effect on Fyn and Lyn. On the other hand, spinacetin suppressed IgE/Ag-induced activation of RBL-2H3 cells with inhibition against phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated-protein kinase (ERK), c-Jun-NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAPKs, PLCgamma, translocation of cPLA2, and Akt/IkappaBalpha/NF-kappaB signal. However, spinacetin had no effect on PMA and A23187-induced activation of HMC-1. Furthermore, oral administration of spinacetin dose-dependently attenuated IgE/Ag-mediated PCA reaction in mouse model. Taken together, spinacetin showed the activities in preventing inflammatory processes, which might be at least partially attributed to the abolishment of Syk-dependent activation of IgE/Ag-mediated mast cells.",,"['Ji, Ning', 'Pan, Shunli', 'Shao, Chen', 'Chen, Yufen', 'Zhang, Zhe', 'Wang, Ran', 'Qiu, Yuling', 'Jin, Meihua', 'Kong, Dexin']","['Ji N', 'Pan S', 'Shao C', 'Chen Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Wang R', 'Qiu Y', 'Jin M', 'Kong D']",,"['Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Pharmacy Department, Tanggu Hospital of Infectious Diseases of Tianjin Binhai New Area, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.', 'Tianjin Key Laboratory on Technologies Enabling Development of Clinical Therapeutics and Diagnostics, School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180730,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6077219,['NOTNLM'],"['IgE/Ag', 'PCA', 'Syk', 'mast cell', 'spinacetin']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2018/08/15 06:01,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.00824 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Jul 30;9:824. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00824. eCollection 2018.,,824,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) continues to be the most potent anti-leukemia treatment for adult patients with intermediate and high-risk AML. However, disease relapse after alloHCT remains unacceptably high and is the primary cause of treatment failure and mortality following alloHCT. It is therefore that post-transplant early cellular or pharmacologic maintenance or preemptive strategies to enhance the graft-versus-leukemia effect or to eradicate persistent minimal residual disease have been of renewed interest, particularly with the availability of more sensitive technologies to measure residual AML. Although preliminary studies have demonstrated improved outcomes with the use of post-alloHCT remission therapies, prospective randomized trials are required to determine their clinical efficacy and role in the treatment of AML.

Therefore, there is a great need for the development of novel and more specific therapies with fewer side effects. The family of Polo-like kinases (Plks) is a group of five serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in cell cycle regulation and are critical targets for therapeutic invention. Plk1 and Plk4 are novel targets for cancer therapy as leukemic cells often express higher levels than normal cells. In contrast, Plk2 and Plk3 are considered to be tumor suppressors. Several small molecule inhibitors have been developed for targeting Plk1 inhibition. Despite reaching phase III clinical trials, one of the ATP-competitive Plk1 inhibitor, volasertib, did not induce an objective clinical response and even caused lethal side effects in some patients. In order to improve the specificity of the Plk1 inhibitors and reduce off-target side effects, novel RNA interference (RNAi)-based therapies have been developed.

The phenoylated phospholipids were obtained in good yields 28(-)66%. The structures of novel compounds were determined by their spectroscopic data. All synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity towards six cancer cell lines and normal cell line Balb/3T3. Lipophilization of phenolcarboxylic acids significantly increased their anticancer properties. The asymmetrically substituted phenoylated phosphatidylcholines exhibited higher antiproliferative effect than free acids. Lysophosphatidylcholine (7b) effectively inhibited the proliferation of human leukaemia (MV4-11), breast (MCF-7), and colon (LoVo) cancer cell lines at concentrations of 9.5(-)20.7 microm and was from 19 to 38-fold more active than corresponding free veratric acid.

It was based on in-frame insertions in or skipping of CD19 exon 2. To distinguish between epitope loss and defects in surface localization, we used retroviral transduction and genome editing to generate cell lines expressing CD19 exon 2 variants (CD19ex2vs) bearing vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVg) tags. These lines were negative by live-cell flow cytometry with an anti-VSVg antibody and resistant to killing by VSVg-directed antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), suggestive of a defect in surface localization. Indeed, pulse-chase and alpha-mannosidase inhibitor assays showed that all CD19ex2vs acquired endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific high-mannose-type sugars but not complex-type glycans synthesized in the Golgi apparatus. When fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP), CD19ex2vs (including a mutant lacking the relevant disulfide bond) showed colocalization with ER markers, implying protein misfolding. Mass spectrometric profiling of CD19-interacting proteins demonstrated that CD19ex2vs fail to bind to the key tetraspanin CD81 and instead interact with ER-resident chaperones, such as calnexin, and ER transporters involved in antigen presentation. Thus, even the intact domains of CD19ex2vs cannot be easily targeted with ADCs or current CD19 CARTs but could serve as sources of peptides for major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted presentation and T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated killing.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Bagashev et al.'],"['Bagashev, Asen', 'Sotillo, Elena', 'Tang, Chih-Hang Anthony', 'Black, Kathryn L', 'Perazzelli, Jessica', 'Seeholzer, Steven H', 'Argon, Yair', 'Barrett, David M', 'Grupp, Stephan A', 'Hu, Chih-Chi Andrew', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko, Andrei']","['Bagashev A', 'Sotillo E', 'Tang CH', 'Black KL', 'Perazzelli J', 'Seeholzer SH', 'Argon Y', 'Barrett DM', 'Grupp SA', 'Hu CC', 'Thomas-Tikhonenko A']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2739-2206'],"[""Division of Experimental Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Immunology, Microenvironment and Metastasis Program, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Protein and Proteomics Core Facility, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", ""Division of Experimental Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Oncology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."", 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Immunology, Microenvironment and Metastasis Program, The Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.', ""Division of Experimental Pathology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA andreit@pennmedicine.upenn.edu."", 'Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181015,United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Gene Editing/methods', 'Golgi Apparatus/metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins']",PMC6189457,['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA splicing', '*immunotherapy', '*membrane proteins', '*membrane transport', '*protein folding']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/06/22 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/22 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['MCB.00383-18 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00383-18 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2018 Oct 15;38(21). pii: MCB.00383-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.00383-18.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of mature, autoreactive B cells in secondary lymphoid tissues, blood, and bone marrow and progressive immune dysfunction. Previous studies in CLL indicated that lenalidomide can repair defective T cell function in vitro. Whether T cell activation is required for clinical response to lenalidomide remains unclear. In this study, we report changes in the immune microenvironment in patients with CLL treated with single-agent lenalidomide and associate the immunologic effects of lenalidomide with antitumor response. Within days of starting lenalidomide, T cells increased in the tumor microenvironment and showed Th1-type polarization. Gene expression profiling of pretreatment and on-treatment lymph node biopsy specimens revealed upregulation of IFN-gamma and many of its target genes in response to lenalidomide. The IFN-gamma-mediated Th1 response was limited to patients achieving a clinical response defined by a reduction in lymphadenopathy. Deep sequencing of TCR genes revealed decreasing diversity of the T cell repertoire and an expansion of select clonotypes in responders. To validate our observations, we stimulated T cells and CLL cells with lenalidomide in culture and detected lenalidomide-dependent increases in T cell proliferation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that lenalidomide induced Th1 immunity in the lymph node that is associated with clinical response.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Aue, Georg', 'Sun, Clare', 'Liu, Delong', 'Park, Jae-Hyun', 'Pittaluga, Stefania', 'Tian, Xin', 'Lee, Elinor', 'Soto, Susan', 'Valdez, Janet', 'Maric, Irina', 'Stetler-Stevenson, Maryalice', 'Yuan, Constance', 'Nakamura, Yusuke', 'Muranski, Pawel', 'Wiestner, Adrian']","['Aue G', 'Sun C', 'Liu D', 'Park JH', 'Pittaluga S', 'Tian X', 'Lee E', 'Soto S', 'Valdez J', 'Maric I', 'Stetler-Stevenson M', 'Yuan C', 'Nakamura Y', 'Muranski P', 'Wiestner A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2497-737X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8498-4729', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4285-3637', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1913-4781', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2591-0353']","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, National Institutes of Health Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; wiestnera@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20180813,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Lenalidomide/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC6143435,,,,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/08/06 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800570 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800570 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Oct 1;201(7):1967-1974. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800570.

Most North American ATLL patients are of Caribbean descent and are characterized by high rates of chemo-refractory disease and worse prognosis compared with Japanese ATLL. To determine genomic differences between these 2 cohorts, we performed targeted exon sequencing on 30 North American ATLL patients and compared the results with the Japanese ATLL cases. Although the frequency of TP53 mutations was comparable, the mutation frequency in epigenetic and histone modifying genes (57%) was significantly higher, whereas the mutation frequency in JAK/STAT and T-cell receptor/NF-kappaB pathway genes was significantly lower. The most common type of epigenetic mutation is that affecting EP300 (20%). As a category, epigenetic mutations were associated with adverse prognosis. Dissimilarities with the Japanese cases were also revealed by RNA sequencing analysis of 9 primary patient samples. ATLL samples with a mutated EP300 gene have decreased total and acetyl p53 protein and a transcriptional signature reminiscent of p53-mutated cancers. Most importantly, decitabine has highly selective single-agent activity in the EP300-mutated ATLL samples, suggesting that decitabine treatment induces a synthetic lethal phenotype in EP300-mutated ATLL cells. In conclusion, we demonstrate that North American ATLL has a distinct genomic landscape that is characterized by frequent epigenetic mutations that are targetable preclinically with DNA methyltransferase inhibitors.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Shah, Urvi A', 'Chung, Elaine Y', 'Giricz, Orsi', 'Pradhan, Kith', 'Kataoka, Keisuke', 'Gordon-Mitchell, Shanisha', 'Bhagat, Tushar D', 'Mai, Yun', 'Wei, Yongqiang', 'Ishida, Elise', 'Choudhary, Gaurav S', 'Joseph, Ancy', 'Rice, Ronald', 'Gitego, Nadege', 'Parrish, Crystall', 'Bartenstein, Matthias', 'Goel, Swati', 'Mantzaris, Ioannis', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Derman, Olga', 'Binder, Adam', 'Gritsman, Kira', 'Kornblum, Noah', 'Braunschweig, Ira', 'Bhagat, Chirag', 'Hall, Jeff', 'Graber, Armin', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Wang, Yanhua', 'Ogawa, Seishi', 'Verma, Amit', 'Ye, B Hilda', 'Janakiram, Murali']","['Shah UA', 'Chung EY', 'Giricz O', 'Pradhan K', 'Kataoka K', 'Gordon-Mitchell S', 'Bhagat TD', 'Mai Y', 'Wei Y', 'Ishida E', 'Choudhary GS', 'Joseph A', 'Rice R', 'Gitego N', 'Parrish C', 'Bartenstein M', 'Goel S', 'Mantzaris I', 'Shastri A', 'Derman O', 'Binder A', 'Gritsman K', 'Kornblum N', 'Braunschweig I', 'Bhagat C', 'Hall J', 'Graber A', 'Ratner L', 'Wang Y', 'Ogawa S', 'Verma A', 'Ye BH', 'Janakiram M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8419-1091', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4527-5505', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7371-1696', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0908-770X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2281-422X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9323-8007']","['Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO.', 'Department of Pathology, Phelps Hospital, Northwell Health, Sleepy Hollow, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Developmental and Molecular Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Cell Biology and.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Oncology, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY.', 'Genoptix, Carlsbad, CA;

Herein we present an autopsy case of SACD caused by folic acid and copper deficiency. A 16-year-old male presented with gradually worsening unsteady gait, and bladder and rectal dysfunction. He had a medical history of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), diagnosed 1.5years previously. The patient had undergone chemotherapy, including methotrexate, as well as allogeneic bone mallow transplantation. Laboratory tests revealed normal vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid concentration, but reduced serum copper, ceruloplasmin and folic acid concentrations. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed symmetrical T2 signal hyperintensities in the posterior and lateral spinal cord. The patient was treated with oral copper, oral folate, and intravenous vitamin B12. A month after this treatment, the patient's symptoms were unchanged, and 2months later he died of acute adrenal insufficiency. The pathological findings of the spinal cord were compatible with SACD. Because SACD is usually reversible with early treatment, it should be suspected in high-risk patients undergoing chemotherapy or those who are malnourished with characteristic symptoms of SACD, even in young patients.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between HGF and c-Fos. First, it was confirmed that the c-Fos was increased in SCs after nerve injury, while this effect abrogated by PHA-665752, an inhibitor of c-met receptor. When primary SCs were treated with recombinant HGF protein, c-Fos expression was regulated in a typical quick, transient fashion at both RNA and proteins levels. HGF-mediated induction of c-Fos expression was highly suppressed by specific inhibitors of ERK and CREB, respectively. The knock down of c-Fos expression by siRNA almost completely blocked various HGF-mediated effects in SCs, such as induction of gene expression of GDNF, LIF, and c-Myc, and migration of SCs, indicating that c-Fos might play a key role in HGF effects.

Recent studies have shown that FOXP3 is associated with growth inhibition of cancer cells. However, the role of FOXP3 in acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells is not known. It was also reported that NOTCH signaling promoted the expression of FOXP3 in Tregs. However, the effect of FOXP3 on NOTCH expression in T-ALL cells is little known. Therefore, we examined the effect of FOXP3 knockdown on the proliferation of T-ALL cells and NOTCH1 signaling. RESULTS: Two T-ALL cell lines Jurkat and KOPT-K1, harboring activating NOTCH1 mutations, were transfected with small interfering RNA against FOXP3. Cell growth was assessed with a colorimetric assay and morphology was observed under a microscope. FOXP3 knockdown significantly reduced cell growth and induced morphological changes suggesting apoptosis. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that FOXP3 knockdown caused the downregulation of mRNA expression of NOTCH1 and HES1. These findings suggest that FOXP3 supports the growth of T-ALL cells although this can not be generalized because we examined only two cell lines. The observed growth suppression can be partly due to the downregulation of NOTCH1 signaling. FOXP3 may be a potential therapeutic target in T-ALL.",,"['Yonekura, Satoru', 'Itoh, Mai', 'Shiratori, Erika', 'Ohtaka, Mika', 'Tohda, Shuji']","['Yonekura S', 'Itoh M', 'Shiratori E', 'Ohtaka M', 'Tohda S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2642-5459'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Yushima 1-5-45, Bunkyo-Ku, Tokyo, 113-8519, Japan. tohda.mlab@tmd.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180813,England,BMC Res Notes,BMC research notes,101462768,"['0 (FOXP3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)']",IM,"['*Cell Proliferation', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Receptor, Notch1/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC6090594,['NOTNLM'],"['FOXP3', 'NOTCH1', 'Small interfering RNA', 'T-lymphoblastic leukemia']",,2018/08/15 06:00,2019/01/04 06:00,['2018/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13104-018-3700-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13104-018-3700-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Res Notes. 2018 Aug 13;11(1):582. doi: 10.1186/s13104-018-3700-3.,1,582,"['26460669/a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) from the Japan Society for', 'the Promotion of Science']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we have performed a high throughput cell death assay using BCL6 knockdown REH ALL cell line to screen a library of FDA-approved oncology drugs. In the process, we have identified a microtubule inhibitor, cabazitaxel (CAB), and a RNA synthesis inhibitor, plicamycin (PLI) as potential anti-leukemic agents. CAB and PLI inhibited cell proliferation in not only the BCL6 knockdown REH cell line, but also six other ALL cell lines. Furthermore, combination of CAB and PLI had a synergistic effect in inhibiting proliferation in a cytarabine-resistant (REH/Ara-C) ALL cell line. Use of nanoparticles for delivery of CAB and PLI demonstrated that the combination was very effective when tested in a co-culture model that mimics the in vivo bone marrow microenvironment that typically supports ALL cell survival and migration into protective niches. Furthermore, exposure to PLI inhibited SOX2 transcription and exposure to CAB inhibited not only Mcl-1 expression but also chemotaxis in ALL cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates the utility of concomitantly targeting different critical regulatory pathways to induce cell death in drug resistant ALL cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Because the prognosis of APMF is extremely poor even after chemotherapy, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been used to treat APMF. However, the outcome after HCT for APMF remains unclear. To evaluate the outcomes and prognostic factors after HCT as a therapeutic modality for APMF, we retrospectively analyzed the Japanese registration data of 40 APMF patients who received allogeneic and syngeneic HCT between 2005 and 2015. The median age at HCT was 53.5 years (range, 16 to 70). The disease status at HCT was first complete remission (CR1) in 13 patients (33%). The probability of overall survival and the cumulative incidence of relapse at 3 years were 24% and 59%, respectively. Univariate analysis identified that female sex and disease status CR1 at the time of HCT were significantly associated with higher overall survival. Although APMF patients have a poor long-term prognosis even after syngeneic and allogeneic HCT, these data suggested that allogeneic HCT offered a curative option for APMF.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, it is associated with significant nonrelapse mortality, which prohibits dose escalation to control relapse. We hypothesized that combining these two drugs with an epigenetic modifier would increase antileukemic efficacy without jeopardizing patient safety. A preclinical study was performed to determine the synergistic cytotoxicity of Bu, 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and the hypomethylating agent decitabine (DAC) in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines. Exposure of KBM3/Bu250(6) (P53-null) and OCI-AML3 (P53-wild-type) cells to Bu+4HC inhibited cell proliferation by approximately 35-39%; addition of DAC increased the inhibition to approximately 60-62%. The observed synergistic interactions correlated with DNA damage response activation, increased the production of reactive oxygen species, and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial proapoptotic proteins into the cytoplasm, and induction of caspase-dependent programmed cell death. The Bu+4HC+DAC combination further caused chromatin trapping of DNMT1 with a concomitant increase in DNA damage. In contrast, FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD)-positive AML cell lines were not sensitized to Bu+4HC by inclusion of DAC; addition of the FLT3 kinase inhibitor sorafenib sensitized the FLT3-ITD-positive MV4-11 and MOLM13 cell lines to the triple drug combination by inhibiting the FLT3 signal transduction pathway. Our results therefore provide a rationale for the development of personalized conditioning therapy for patients with P53-mutated and FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",['Published by Elsevier Inc.'],"['Valdez, Benigno C', 'Tang, Xiaowen', 'Li, Yang', 'Murray, David', 'Liu, Yan', 'Popat, Uday', 'Champlin, Richard E', 'Andersson, Borje S']","['Valdez BC', 'Tang X', 'Li Y', 'Murray D', 'Liu Y', 'Popat U', 'Champlin RE', 'Andersson BS']",,"['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

We therefore determined if serum sema3A concentrations are correlated with MM progression and if sema3A can affect MM progression. We find that the concentration of sema3A in sera of MM patients is strongly reduced and that the decrease is correlated with disease progression. A similar depletion is found in patients having acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia but not in cancer forms that do not involve the bone marrow such as in colon cancer. Expression of a modified sema3A [furin-resistant sema3A (FR-sema3A)] stabilized against cleavage by furin-like proprotein convertases in CAG MM cells did not affect their behavior in-vitro. CAG cells injected into the tail vein of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice home to the bone marrow and proliferate, mimicking MM disease progression. Disease progression in mice injected with CAG cells expressing FR-sema3A was inhibited, resulting in prolonged survival and a lower incidence of bone lesions. Histological examination and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis revealed that FR-sema3A expression reduced the infiltration of the CAG cells into the bone marrow, reduced bone marrow necrosis and reduced angiogenesis induced by the MM cells in the bone marrow. Our results suggest that measurement of sema3A serum concentrations may be of use for the diagnosis and for the monitoring of malignancies of the bone marrow such as MM. Furthermore, our results suggest that FR-sema3A may perhaps find use as an inhibitor of MM disease progression.",,"['Lavi, Noa', 'Kessler, Ofra', 'Ziv, Keren', 'Nir-Zvi, Inbal', 'Mumblat, Yelena', 'Eiza, Nasrene', 'Paran, Yael', 'Brenner, Benjamin', 'Vadasz, Zahava', 'Neufeld, Gera']","['Lavi N', 'Kessler O', 'Ziv K', 'Nir-Zvi I', 'Mumblat Y', 'Eiza N', 'Paran Y', 'Brenner B', 'Vadasz Z', 'Neufeld G']",,"['Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Institute, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Institute, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel.', 'Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Cancer Research Center, The Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Semaphorin-3A)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*blood/pathology', 'Semaphorin-3A/*blood/metabolism']",,,,,2018/08/14 06:00,2019/04/23 06:00,['2018/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['5068270 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgy106 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2018 Oct 8;39(10):1283-1291. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgy106.,10,1283-1291,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most CRC patients have poor prognosis mainly because of frequent metastasis and recurrence. Thus, it is crucial to find out some new biomarkers and to show deeper insights into the mechanisms of CRC. MLLT10, Myeloid/lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia translocated to 10, also known as AF10, a recurrent MLL partner. In this study, we found that MLLT10 promotes CRC tumor invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Here, the expression of MLLT10 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Then, the plasmid and lentivirus particles for MLLT10 overexpression or knockdown were designed and constructed into SW620 and HT29 cells. Finally, cell proliferation assay, cell adhesion assay, transwell migration, and invasion assay were used to detect the migration and invasion ability of MLLT10 in CRC cells. A tail vein injection assay was employed to evaluate the role of MLLT10 in tumor metastases. RESULTS: MLLT10 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues than in noncancerous tissues and was associated with some clinicopathological factors. In vitro, the overexpression of MLLT10 promoted CRC cell migration and invasion, while after MLLT10 was knocked down, the opposite results were observed. Furthermore, we used animal metastasis models to detect the function of MLLT10 in vivo, the results are same with the outcomes in vitro. In lung metastasis sites, the knockdown of MLLT10 in SW620 cells significantly inhibited Vimentin expression, whereas the E-Cadherin was increased.

This study is based on an in vitro alveolar barrier developed on a basement membrane mimic, composed of ultrathin nanofiber meshes generated via electrospinning using bioresorbable poly(varepsilon-caprolactone). As cellular components, NCI H441, resembling the alveolar epithelial cells, and ISO-HAS-1, an endothelial cell line, were used to perform bipolar coculture experiments for a total cultivation period of 14 days. In addition to immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent studies, transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and transport capabilities of the in vitro model system were investigated. Alveolar barrier function could be clearly determined for the postulated bipolar coculture system on the basement membrane mimic, since TER increased during the course of bipolar cultivation. Furthermore, to gain first insights into possible lung inflammatory reactions in vitro, this coculture model was further expanded by a human leukemia monocyte cell line (THP-1). This triple-culture system was able to maintain adequately the barrier properties of the bipolar coculture, thus making this in vitro model consisting of epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells on a basement membrane mimic a promising basis for further studies in tissue engineering.",,"['Dohle, Eva', 'Singh, Smriti', 'Nishigushi, Akihiro', 'Fischer, Thorsten', 'Wessling, Matthias', 'Moller, Martin', 'Sader, Robert', 'Kasper, Jennifer', 'Ghanaati, Shahram', 'Kirkpatrick, C James']","['Dohle E', 'Singh S', 'Nishigushi A', 'Fischer T', 'Wessling M', 'Moller M', 'Sader R', 'Kasper J', 'Ghanaati S', 'Kirkpatrick CJ']",,"['1 FORM, Frankfurt Orofacial Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Maxillofacial and Plastic Surgery, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University , Frankfurt Am Main, Germany .', '2 DWI Leibniz-Institute for Interactive Materials , Aachen, Germany .', '2 DWI Leibniz-Institute for Interactive Materials , Aachen, Germany .', '2 DWI Leibniz-Institute for Interactive Materials , Aachen, Germany .', '2 DWI Leibniz-Institute for Interactive Materials , Aachen, Germany .', '2 DWI Leibniz-Institute for Interactive Materials , Aachen, Germany .', '3 Institute of Technical and Macromolecular Chemistry, RWTH Aachen University , Aachen, Germany .', '1 FORM, Frankfurt Orofacial Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Maxillofacial and Plastic Surgery, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University , Frankfurt Am Main, Germany .', '4 INM - Leibniz Institute for New Materials , Saarbrucken, Germany .', '1 FORM, Frankfurt Orofacial Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Maxillofacial and Plastic Surgery, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University , Frankfurt Am Main, Germany .', '1 FORM, Frankfurt Orofacial Regenerative Medicine, Clinic for Maxillofacial and Plastic Surgery, Johann Wolfgang Goethe University , Frankfurt Am Main, Germany .', '5 Department of Biomaterials, University of Gothenburg , Goteborg, Sweden .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Tissue Eng Part C Methods,"Tissue engineering.

Areas covered: This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the ways to prevent intubation in IC patients with ARF. Expert commentary: Striking differences oppose ARF incidence, characteristics, etiologies and management between IC and non-IC patients. Survival benefits have been reported with early admission to ICU in IC patients. Then, while managing hypoxemia and associated organ dysfunction, the identification of the cause of ARF will be guided by a rigorous clinical assessment at the bedside, further assisted by an invasive or noninvasive diagnostic strategy based on clinical probability for each etiology. Finally, the initial respiratory support aims to avoid mechanical ventilation for the many yet recognizing those patients for whom delaying intubation expose them to suboptimal management. We advocate for not using noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in this setting. A proper evaluation of High-flow nasal cannula oxygen (HFNC) is required in IC patients as to demonstrate its superiority compared to standard oxygen therapy. Day-to-day decisions must strive to avoid delayed intubation, and make every effort to identify ARF etiology.",,"['De Jong, Audrey', 'Calvet, Laure', 'Lemiale, Virginie', 'Demoule, Alexandre', 'Mokart, Djamel', 'Darmon, Michael', 'Jaber, Samir', 'Azoulay, Elie']","['De Jong A', 'Calvet L', 'Lemiale V', 'Demoule A', 'Mokart D', 'Darmon M', 'Jaber S', 'Azoulay E']",,"['a Medical Intensive Care Unit , University of Paris-Diderot, Saint Louis Hospital , Paris , France.', 'b Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B , Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a Medical Intensive Care Unit , University of Paris-Diderot, Saint Louis Hospital , Paris , France.', 'a Medical Intensive Care Unit , University of Paris-Diderot, Saint Louis Hospital , Paris , France.', 'c Service de Pneumologie et Reanimation Medicale , Groupe Hospitalier Pitie-Salpetriere, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, INSERM et Universite Pierre et Marie Curie , Paris , France.', ""d Reanimation Polyvalente et Departement d'Anesthesie et de Reanimation , Institut Paoli-Calmettes , Marseille , France."", 'a Medical Intensive Care Unit , University of Paris-Diderot, Saint Louis Hospital , Paris , France.', 'e ECSTRA Team, and Clinical Epidemiology , UMR 1153 (Center of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CRESS), INSERM, Paris Diderot Sorbonne University , Paris , France.', 'b Anesthesiology and Intensive Care; Anesthesia and Critical Care Department B , Saint Eloi Teaching Hospital, PhyMedExp, University of Montpellier , Montpellier , France.', 'a Medical Intensive Care Unit , University of Paris-Diderot, Saint Louis Hospital , Paris , France.', 'e ECSTRA Team, and Clinical Epidemiology , UMR 1153 (Center of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Sorbonne Paris Cite, CRESS), INSERM, Paris Diderot Sorbonne University , Paris , France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180828,England,Expert Rev Respir Med,Expert review of respiratory medicine,101278196,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intubation, Intratracheal/*adverse effects', 'Oxygen Inhalation Therapy/*methods', 'Respiration, Artificial/*methods', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Immunosuppression', '*leukemia', '*lymphoma', '*mechanical ventilation', '*neutropenia', '*noninvasive ventilation', '*oxygen']",,2018/08/14 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17476348.2018.1511430 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Respir Med. 2018 Oct;12(10):867-880. doi: 10.1080/17476348.2018.1511430.

This study aims to analyze the clinical and biochemical characteristics and treatment outcomes of TLS in children with leukemia/lymphomas in a resource-limited setting. PROCEDURE: Children with intermediate risk (IRD) and high risk (HRD) for developing TLS were retrospectively studied at a tertiary cancer center in India. RESULTS: Over a three-year period, 224 children with acute leukemia/lymphoma having IRD (21.8%, n = 49) and HRD (78.1%, n = 175) were identified. TLS developed in 53.6% (n = 120) cases, of which 75% (n = 90) had laboratory TLS alone. Thirteen children had clinical TLS (C-TLS) at presentation while 17 patients progressed to develop C-TLS. TLS developed in 51% (n = 25) and 54.5% (n = 95) of children with IRD and HRD, respectively. Rasburicase was used in 8.5% (n = 19) cases and five children required hemodialysis. Two children (0.8%) expired during the course of TLS management. Multivariate analysis identified the presence of hyperuricemia as the single significant risk factor for developing TLS. When children in whom a 25% change in biochemical values from the baseline that falls within the normal range were excluded, 21.4% (48/224) cases were identified to have clinically relevant TLS (8% in IRD and 25% in HRD). CONCLUSION: With hydration, supportive care and judicious use of rasburicase, it is feasible to manage TLS efficiently in resource-limited settings. A modification of the TLS definition criteria would help to identify clinically relevant TLS.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gopakumar, Kaduveettil Gopinathan', 'Seetharam, Shwetha', 'Km, Jagathnath Krishna', 'Nair, Manjusha', 'Rajeswari, Binitha', 'Cs, Guruprasad', 'Vr, Prasanth', 'Thankamony, Priyakumari']","['Gopakumar KG', 'Seetharam S', 'Km JK', 'Nair M', 'Rajeswari B', 'Cs G', 'Vr P', 'Thankamony P']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6589-379X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2343-988X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6393-6357', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2667-1625', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9245-2060', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8332-8391']","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Cancer Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180812,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Gout Suppressants)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*complications', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Developing Countries', 'Female', 'Gout Suppressants/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'India/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Male', 'Poverty', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/drug therapy/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Urate Oxidase/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*hyperuricemia', '*leukemia', '*non-Hodgkin lymphoma', '*pediatric oncology', '*rasburicase', '*tumor lysis syndrome']",,2018/08/14 06:00,2019/05/11 06:00,['2018/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27401 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Dec;65(12):e27401. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27401.

We have previously utilized an in vitro model of the most common form of childhood cancer, B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), to show that activation of the cAMP signaling pathway inhibits p53-mediated apoptosis in response to DNA damage in both cell lines and primary leukemic cells. The present study reveals that cAMP-mediated survival of BCP-ALL cells exposed to DNA damaging agents, involves a critical and p53-independent enhancement of autophagy. Although autophagy generally is regarded as a survival mechanism, DNA damage-induced apoptosis has been linked both to enhanced and reduced levels of autophagy. Here we show that exposure of BCP-ALL cells to irradiation or cytotoxic drugs triggers autophagy and cell death in a p53-dependent manner. Stimulation of the cAMP signaling pathway further augments autophagy and inhibits the DNA damage-induced cell death concomitant with reduced nuclear levels of p53. Knocking-down the levels of p53 reduced the irradiation-induced autophagy and cell death, but had no effect on the cAMP-mediated autophagy. Moreover, prevention of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 or by the ULK-inhibitor MRT68921, diminished the protecting effect of cAMP signaling on DNA damage-induced cell death. Having previously proposed a role of the cAMP signaling pathway in development and treatment of BCP-ALLs, we here suggest that inhibitors of autophagy may improve current DNA damage-based therapy of BCP-ALL - independent of p53.",,"['Skah, Seham', 'Richartz, Nina', 'Duthil, Eva', 'Gilljam, Karin M', 'Bindesboll, Christian', 'Naderi, Elin Hallan', 'Eriksen, Agnete B', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Dirdal, Marta M', 'Simonsen, Anne', 'Blomhoff, Heidi Kiil']","['Skah S', 'Richartz N', 'Duthil E', 'Gilljam KM', 'Bindesboll C', 'Naderi EH', 'Eriksen AB', 'Ruud E', 'Dirdal MM', 'Simonsen A', 'Blomhoff HK']",,"['Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Section for Head and Neck Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Cancer Cell Reprogramming, Institute of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180713,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6084393,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'apoptosis', 'autophagy', 'cAMP-signaling', 'p53']","['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that there are no competing financial', 'interests in relation to the work described.']",2018/08/14 06:00,2018/08/14 06:01,['2018/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25758 [doi]', '25758 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jul 13;9(54):30434-30449. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25758. eCollection 2018 Jul 13.,54,30434-30449,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, we profiled control and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) alone or in combination with other drug-treated CML-samples in different phases, categorized as drug-sensitive and drug-resistant on the basis of BCR-ABL transcripts, the marker of major molecular-response. Molecular-profiling was done using the molecular-inversion probe-based-array, Human Transcriptomics-Array2.0, and Axiom-Biobank genotyping-arrays. At the transcript-level, clusters of control, TKI-resistant and TKI-sensitive cases were correlated with BCR-ABL transcript-levels. Both at the gene- and exon-levels, up-regulation of MPO, TPX2, and TYMS and down-regulation of STAT6, FOS, TGFBR2, and ITK lead up-regulation of the cell-cycle, DNA-replication, DNA-repair pathways and down-regulation of the immune-system, chemokine- and interleukin-signaling, TCR, TGF beta and MAPK signaling pathways. A comparison between TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant cases revealed up-regulation of LAPTM4B, HLTF, PIEZO2, CFH, CD109, ANGPT1 in CML-resistant cases, leading to up-regulation of autophagy-, protein-ubiquitination-, stem-cell-, complement-, TGFbeta- and homeostasis-pathways with specific involvement of the Tie2 and Basigin signaling-pathway. Dysregulated pathways were accompanied with low CNVs in CP-new and CP-UT-TKI-sensitive-cases with undetectable BCR-ABL-copies.

Methods: A comprehensive search of Pubmed, Web of Science, EBSCO, the Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure was conducted to identify original articles published before March 2017 concerning the association between XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms and leukemia risk. A literature quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Heterogeneity across studies was assessed using I(2) statistics. Random- or fixed-effects models were used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) in the presence or absence of heterogeneity, respectively. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the influence of individual studies on the pooled estimate. Publication bias was investigated using funnel plots and Egger's regression test. All data analyses were performed using Stata 14.0 and Revman 5.3. Results: Fourteen studies with a total of 7525 participants (2,757 patients; 4,768 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. We found that XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms significantly increased the risk of developing leukemia in both dominant OR = 1.21, 95%CI [1.10-1.35], P </= 0.001) and heterozygote (OR = 1.22, 95%CI [1.09-1.36], P </= 0.001) model. An allele model showed a borderline significant increase in leukemia risk (OR = 1.13, 95%CI [1.00-1.27], P = 0.05). A subgroup analysis revealed a consistent association between XPD Lys751Gln polymorphisms and leukemia risk for some genetic models in Caucasian populations, adult or chronic groups, and in almost all models of childhood or acute groups.

RTH is an important Chinese traditional herb that has been widely used in cancer therapy. As an important type of active substance, RTH flavones (RTHF) have been shown to have good antiproliferative effects on various cancer cells. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that play important roles in cancer progression and prevention. However, the miRNA profile of RTHF-treated A549 cells has not yet been studied. Materials and methods: The miRNA expression profile changes of A549 cell treated with RTHF were determined using the miRNA-seq analysis. Furthermore, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses of differentially expressed miRNAs' (DE-miRNAs) target genes were carried out. Results: In this study, we identified 162 miRNAs that displayed expression changes >1.2-fold in RTHF-treated A549 cells. GO analysis results showed that target genes of DE-miRNAs were significantly enriched in protein binding, binding, cell, cell part, intracellular, cellular process, single-organism process, and single-organism cellular process. Pathway analysis illustrated that target genes of DE-miRNAs are mainly involved in endocytosis, axon guidance, lysosome, melanogenesis, and acute myeloid leukemia pathway.

The behavioral distress of patients who underwent psychosocial interventions for BMA and LP was compared with patients without interventions. We also analyzed the difference of behavioral distress in patients' pre- and post-psychosocial intervention for BMA and LP. RESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled into this study. The mean age of diagnosis of leukemia was 6.6 years old (range: 3-11 years). Fifteen patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and 3 were diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. The mean of OSBD-R total scores in 7 patients with psychosocial intervention was significantly lower than the mean score in 6 patients without intervention (0.65 vs. 4.81, p = 0.002). Pre- and post-psychosocial intervention for BMA and LP behavioral distress were evaluated for the remaining 5 patients. Consistently, there was a significant reduction of the OSBD-R score following interventions (3.04 vs. 7.81, p = 0.025). CONCLUSION: Psychosocial interventions provided by a certified child life specialist have a significant potential to reduce children's distress during BMA and LP in pediatric healthcare settings in Taiwan.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) provides curative potential but a substantial proportion of patients eventually will relapse. It is unknown if there are any modifiable factors exists that could improve survival or predict relapse immediately after HSCT is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore whether achieving early (<30 days) full donor chimerism (FDC) could predict disease relapse after allogeneic HSCT in ALL patients. A second objective is to examine the impact of achieving early donor chimerism on survival. METHODS: This study retrospectively enrolled 55 ALL patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT during the 10-year period from 1999 to 2008. Analysis of short tandem repeats (STR) was used to determine donor chimerism, and was prospectively followed at the time of engraftment and on days 30. Patients with early treatment-related mortality (<30 days), without STR analysis, or who were lost to follow-up before FDC were excluded. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier Methods. Cox proportional hazard analyses were performed for poor prognostic factors associated with overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS). RESULTS: The general characteristics were comparable between patients with early donor chimerism (n = 31) and those with late donor chimerism (n = 24). Survival analyses showed patients with early FDC had both lower probability of relapse (chi(2) = 5.770, p = 0.022) and longer RFS than those with late chimerism. The OS was not different according to the chimerism status on days 30. In the Cox proportional hazard analyses, early FDC is a significant factor predictive for longer RFS (HR = 0.264, p = 0.010). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the achievement of early FDC within 30 days after allogenic HSCT can be used as a significant predictor of RFS. The results underscored the need to improve outcome in ALL patients with late FDC.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

We aimed to retrospectively compare outcomes following autologous stem cell transplantation (autoSCT) with allogeneic SCT (alloSCT) and consolidation chemotherapy (CMT) in patients with intermediate-risk karyotype AML in first complete remission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We compared overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) using propensity score (PS)-adjusted analysis of patients receiving PRT with autoSCT, matched sibling (MSD) alloSCT, unrelated/mismatch (UD/MM) alloSCT, and CMT. We included patients diagnosed between 1984 and 2003 (period of autoSCT at our center) in CR1 following induction CMT and received at least 2 consolidative cycles. RESULTS: We identified 190 patients (62 MSD-alloSCT, 18 UD/MM-alloSCT, 30 autoSCT, and 80 CMT). Baseline characteristics were used for PS calculation and were well-balanced after weight adjustment. The median follow-up for patients surviving beyond 1 year was 8.7 years. We excluded 55 patients based on PS calculation. Adjusted multivariate hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI) and P-value for OS, considering CMT as reference, were: MSD-alloSCT (HR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8; P = .009), UD/MM-alloSCT (HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6-3.9; P = .363), and autoSCT (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.5-3.1; P = .666), respectively. Adjusted multivariate HR, 95% CI and P-value for LFS were MSD-alloSCT (HR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6; P < .001), UD/MM-alloSCT (HR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.4-2.7; P = .854), and autoSCT (HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.3-2.2; P = .697), respectively. CONCLUSION: Patients with intermediate risk-karyotype acute myeloid leukemia who underwent MSD-alloSCT in first complete remission had the best outcomes. There were no survival differences between autoSCT, UD/MM-alloSCT, and CMT. Further study incorporating molecular changes and minimal residual disease status is warranted to select appropriate patients for autoSCT.",['Crown Copyright (c) 2018. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These evolutionary preserved, single-stranded, non-coding RNA molecules mediate important functional effects primarily through post-transcriptional regulation of protein expression. MiRNAs are known to mediate multiple oncogenic pathways in tumor cells, both tumor promoting and tumor suppressing. In addition to a direct tumor cell effect, miRNAs have also been shown to play a critical role in immune cell development, function and survival. Here we expand on previous reports to evaluate miRNA regulation in natural killer (NK) cells primarily in humans and focus on their influence on NK cell development and function in the setting of hematologic malignancies.

METHODS: The study population consisted of 86 consecutive patients with febrile neutropenia who received intensive chemotherapy for haematological malignancy between November 2009 and November 2012 at the adult haematology ward of Kuopio University Hospital. Twenty-three (27%) patients had acute myeloid leukaemia and 63 (73%) patients were autologous stem cell transplant recipients. IL-1Ra, CRP and procalcitonin were measured at the onset of fever (d0), on day 1 (d1) and on day 2 (d2). RESULTS: Eight patients developed severe sepsis, including three patients with septic shock. Eighteen patients had bacteraemia. After the onset of febrile neutropenia Youden s indices (with their 95% confidence intervals) to identify severe sepsis were for IL-1Ra on d0 0.57 (0.20-0.71) and on d1 0.65 (0.28-0.78), for CRP on d0 0.41 (0.04-0.61) and on d1 0.47 (0.11-0.67) and for PCT on d0 0.39 (0.05-0.66) and on d1 0.52 (0.18-0.76).

The released nuclear contents, called extracellular traps, can activate the contact system of coagulation. This study accessed the extent of contact system activation, the levels of extracellular traps, and coagulation activation in hematologic malignancies including acute leukemia. In 154 patients with hematologic malignancies (acute leukemia, n = 29; myelodysplastic syndrome, n = 20; myeloproliferative neoplasms, n = 69; plasma cell myeloma, n = 36) and 48 normal controls, the levels of coagulation factors (fibrinogen and factor VII, VIII, IX, and XII), D-dimer, thrombin generation, extracellular trap markers (histone-DNA complex, cell-free dsDNA, leukocyte elastase), and contact system markers (activated factor XII [XIIa], high-molecular-weight kininogen, prekallikrein, bradykinin) were measured. Patients with acute leukemia showed the highest levels of peak thrombin, extracellular trap markers, and factor XIIa. Factor XIIa level was significantly associated with the presence of acute leukemia. The histone-DNA complex and cell-free dsDNA were revealed as significant associated factors with the factor XIIa level. Three markers of extracellular traps and two markers of thrombin generation significantly contributed to the hemostatic abnormalities in hematologic malignancies. Contact system was activated in acute leukemia and its activation was significantly associated with the extent of extracellular trap formation. This finding suggests that extracellular traps might be a major source of contact system activation and therapeutic strategies targeting extracellular trap formation or contact system activation may be beneficial in acute leukemia.",,"['Kim, Tae Yeul', 'Gu, Ja-Yoon', 'Jung, Hye Soo', 'Koh, Youngil', 'Kim, Inho', 'Kim, Hyun Kyung']","['Kim TY', 'Gu JY', 'Jung HS', 'Koh Y', 'Kim I', 'Kim HK']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea. kim_dajung@hanmail.net.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehang-ro, Jongno-gu, Seoul, 03080, South Korea. lukekhk@snu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Netherlands,J Thromb Thrombolysis,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,9502018,"['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Blood Coagulation Factors/analysis', 'Extracellular Traps/*metabolism', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/*pathology', 'Thrombin/biosynthesis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute leukemia', 'Contact system', 'Hematologic malignancies', 'Neutrophil extracellular traps', 'Thrombin generation assay', 'Thrombosis']",,2018/08/14 06:00,2018/11/15 06:00,['2018/08/13 06:00'],"['2018/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11239-018-1713-3 [doi]', '10.1007/s11239-018-1713-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thromb Thrombolysis. 2018 Oct;46(3):379-385. doi: 10.1007/s11239-018-1713-3.,3,379-385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in a previous meta-analysis, G-CSF prophylaxis was associated with an increased risk of secondary malignancies while reducing long-term mortality. We present here an updated systematic review and meta-analysis. Materials and methods: A systematic literature search was carried out to identify randomized controlled trials of cancer patients receiving conventional-dose chemotherapy, assigned to primary G-CSF support or a control group without initial G-CSF, with at least 2 years of follow-up. Studies were categorized into one of the four groups, based on the chemotherapy regimen and study design. An updated meta-analysis was carried out; relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality and secondary malignancies were calculated. Results: Of 2604 articles screened, 14 eligible studies were identified and combined with studies identified in the previous systematic literature searches. The updated meta-analysis included a total of 68 studies presenting 71 separate comparisons. Survival was significantly improved in patients receiving primary G-CSF support, compared with patients without primary G-CSF support (mortality RR=0.92; 95% CI 0.90-0.95; ARD=-3.3%; 95% CI -4.2--2.4; P < 0.0001). The largest improvement in survival was observed with dose-dense chemotherapy regimens with G-CSF support, compared with controls receiving no G-CSF support (mortality RR=0.86; 95% CI 0.80-0.92; P < 0.0001). Patients who received primary G-CSF support experienced a significantly higher risk of secondary malignancies, compared with controls (RR=1.85; 95% CI 1.19-2.88; ARD=0.47; 95% CI 0.21-0.73; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that overall survival is improved in patients receiving intensified chemotherapy with primary G-CSF support, compared with those receiving standard chemotherapy. Primary G-CSF support was also associated with a higher risk of developing secondary malignancies, including secondary acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.",,"['Lyman, G H', 'Yau, L', 'Nakov, R', 'Krendyukov, A']","['Lyman GH', 'Yau L', 'Nakov R', 'Krendyukov A']",,"['Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle; University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, USA.', 'Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany.', 'Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany.', 'Hexal AG, Holzkirchen, Germany.

The identification of novel agents to improve therapeutic strategies becomes important priority for AML treatment. It has been shown that emodin has therapeutic effects on many kinds of human malignant tumors. In this study, we investigated the anti-leukemia effects of emodin alone or in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C) on multidrug-resistant AML HL-60/ADR cells and in a mouse xenograft model of human highly tumorigenic AML HL-60/H3 cells. The underlying mechanism was also addressed. METHODS: Cell viability after treatment was measured by MTT assay. The DNA fragmentation assay, Annexin V-PE/7-AAD, AO/EB staining, and electron microscopy were introduced to assess the apoptotic induction effects. Changes in protein expression in the Akt and ERK signaling pathways were determined by western blotting. In vivo antileukemia effects on HL-60/H3 xenograft model and overall mouse survival outcomes were further analyzed in this study. RESULTS: Emodin dose-dependently induced growth inhibition and apoptotic effects in resistant HL-60/ADR cells in vitro as well as in the HL-60/H3 xenograft models in vivo. Moreover, emodin significantly enhanced chemosensitivity of AML cells to Ara-C, inhibited leukemic cell growth, and improved survival in the mouse xenograft model of AML. Dual targeting of Akt and ERK signaling pathways might contribute to the anti-leukemia effects on AML cells in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSION: Emodin and its combination with Ara-C may be considered a promising therapeutic approach in AML and worthy of further investigation.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

Many condensates behave as dynamic liquids and appear to form through liquid-liquid phase separation driven by weak, multivalent interactions between macromolecules. In this review, we discuss current models and data regarding the control of condensate composition, and we describe our current understanding of the composition of representative condensates including PML nuclear bodies, P-bodies, stress granules, the nucleolus, and two-dimensional membrane localized LAT and nephrin clusters. Specific interactions, such as interactions between modular binding domains, weaker interactions between intrinsically disorder regions and nucleic acid base pairing, and nonspecific interactions, such as electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic interactions, influence condensate composition. Understanding how specific condensate composition is determined is essential to understanding condensates as biochemical entities and ultimately discerning their cellular and organismic functions.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

Based on a large database representing 1.3 billion person-years over the period 1991-2010, we provide a consolidated report on cancer incidence trends at ages 0-19 years. METHODS: We invited all population-based cancer registries operating in European countries to participate in this population-based registry study. We requested a listing of individual records of cancer cases, including sex, age, date of birth, date of cancer diagnosis, tumour sequence number, primary site, morphology, behaviour, and the most valid basis of diagnosis. We also requested population counts in each calendar year by sex and age for the registration area, from official national sources, and specific information about the covered area and registration practices. An eligible registry could become a contributor if it provided quality data for all complete calendar years in the period 1991-2010. Incidence rates and the average annual percentage change with 95% CIs were reported for all cancers and major diagnostic groups, by region and overall, separately for children (age 0-14 years) and adolescents (age 15-19 years). We examined and quantified the stability of the trends with joinpoint analyses. FINDINGS: For the years 1991-2010, 53 registries in 19 countries contributed a total of 180 335 unique cases. We excluded 15 162 (8.4%) of 180 335 cases due to differing practices of registration, and considered the quality indicators for the 165 173 cases included to be satisfactory. The average annual age-standardised incidence was 137.5 (95% CI 136.7-138.3) per million person-years and incidence increased significantly by 0.54% (0.44-0.65) per year in children (age 0-14 years) with no change in trend. In adolescents, the combined European incidence was 176.2 (174.4-178.0) per million person-years based on all 35 138 eligible cases and increased significantly by 0.96% (0.73-1.19) per year, although recent changes in rates among adolescents suggest a deceleration in this increasing trend. We observed temporal variations in trends by age group, geographical region, and diagnostic group. The combined age-standardised incidence of leukaemia based on 48 458 cases in children was 46.9 (46.5-47.3) per million person-years and increased significantly by 0.66% (0.48-0.84) per year. The average overall incidence of leukaemia in adolescents was 23.6 (22.9-24.3) per million person-years, based on 4702 cases, and the average annual change was 0.93% (0.49-1.37). We also observed increasing incidence of lymphoma in adolescents (average annual change 1.04% [0.65-1.44], malignant CNS tumours in children (average annual change 0.49% [0.20-0.77]), and other tumours in both children (average annual change 0.56 [0.40-0.72]) and adolescents (average annual change 1.17 [0.82-1.53]). INTERPRETATION: Improvements in the diagnosis and registration of cancers over time could partly explain the observed increase in incidence, although some changes in underlying putative risk factors cannot be excluded. Cancer incidence trends in this young population require continued monitoring at an international level.

Currently, first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib is the mainstay for the treatment of CML. Second generation TKI's like ponatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and bafetinib were treated against resistant CML. However, several CML patients develop resistance towards all existing inhibitors. Curcumin (Curcuma longa) a plant-derived natural compound is an effective bioactive component against various cancers including CML. Many studies have shown that curcumin induces time- and dose-dependent apoptosis in CML cells by regulating various downstream molecular regulators. Despite curcumin's selective cytotoxicity towards cancer cells, it has very poor bioavailability both in in-vitro and in-vivo conditions. In this present study, we have used femtosecond laser (fs-laser) pulses to ablate the cell membrane and standardized the conditions required for creating a cell membrane pores with less lethality. Following fs-laser pulse irradiation, K562 cells were incubated along with curcumin 30muM for 0h, 6h,12h and 24h. Interestingly irradiated cells have shown higher sensitivity towards curcumin than non-irradiated cells.

Comorbidities may compromise fitness and eligibility for high-intensity chemotherapy (HIC). This study presents the results of two systematic reviews (SRs) assessing (1) the impact of AML and current treatments on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and (2) the economic burden and cost drivers of AML in patients who are ineligible for HIC. METHODS: Electronic searches (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EconLit, Cochrane library) were supplemented with manual searching of conference, utility, and HTA databases. All studies reporting HRQoL or economic data for patients with AML who were ineligible for HIC were included. RESULTS: The HRQoL SR included ten studies. Patients with AML have lower baseline HRQoL than other cancer patients or the general population, and those receiving lower intensity treatment have lower HRQoL than those eligible for HIC. Low baseline HRQoL predicts poor outcomes, and treatment had variable effects on HRQoL. The economic burden SR included nine studies. Medical costs varied widely, reflecting the heterogeneity of AML. Hospitalization is a key cost driver in AML treatment but was largely not considered in cost studies. Medical resource utilization comprised drug acquisition, drug administration, disease monitoring tests, transfusions, adverse event management, supportive care/monitoring costs and terminal care. CONCLUSION: As new drugs emerge that extend survival, assessment of HRQoL will be important to evaluate the quality of that survival. Cost data, driven by transfusions and hospitalization, will be important to evaluate the economic value of new treatments.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

The dysregulation of F-Box and WD Repeat Domain Containing 7 (FBXW7) is associated with therapeutic resistance in cancer cells. However, the correlation between FBXW7 expression and CRT sensitivity in patients with clinical ESCC has been investigated only in few studies. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the significance of FBXW7 expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from patients with ESCC receiving CRT. METHODS: We investigated the relationship between FBXW7 expression and CRT sensitivity in 30 pretreatment biopsy specimens with histological grades of post-CRT surgically resected tumors. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of high FBXW7 expression on the sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, including docetaxel and nedaplatin, and radiation in ESCC cells in vitro. RESULTS: High FBXW7 expression before CRT correlated with a good pathological CRT response in patients with advanced ESCC (P < .05). Further, our in vitro data showed that both chemo and radiation sensitivity increased in TE-8 and KYSE140 cells overexpressing FBXW7 compared with mock cells because of the degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL1. CONCLUSIONS: The evaluation of FBXW7 expression before CRT treatment is a potential predictor of good responders among patients with ESCC receiving CRT.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gombodorj, Navchaa', 'Yokobori, Takehiko', 'Tanaka, Naritaka', 'Suzuki, Shigemasa', 'Kuriyama, Kengo', 'Kumakura, Yuji', 'Yoshida, Tomonori', 'Sakai, Makoto', 'Sohda, Makoto', 'Baatar, Seded', 'Miyazaki, Tatsuya', 'Nishiyama, Masahiko', 'Shirabe, Ken', 'Kuwano, Hiroyuki']","['Gombodorj N', 'Yokobori T', 'Tanaka N', 'Suzuki S', 'Kuriyama K', 'Kumakura Y', 'Yoshida T', 'Sakai M', 'Sohda M', 'Baatar S', 'Miyazaki T', 'Nishiyama M', 'Shirabe K', 'Kuwano H']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9290-3706', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3284-4796', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4890-3789', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0810-7166']","['Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, National Cancer Center, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology and Pharmacology, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Research Program for Omics-based Medical Science, Division of Integrated Oncology Research, Gunma University Initiative for Advanced Research (GIAR), Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Department of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.', 'Departments of General Surgical Science, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180811,United States,J Surg Oncol,Journal of surgical oncology,0222643,"['0 (F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7)', '0 (FBXW7 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Taxoids)', '15H5577CQD (Docetaxel)', '8UQ3W6JXAN (nedaplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Biopsy', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chemoradiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Docetaxel', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'F-Box-WD Repeat-Containing Protein 7/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Taxoids/administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['cytotoxic agents', 'radiation sensitivity', 'squamous cell carcinoma']",,2018/08/12 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2018/08/12 06:00'],"['2018/01/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jso.25127 [doi]'],ppublish,J Surg Oncol. 2018 Jul;118(1):101-108. doi: 10.1002/jso.25127.

Pooled results from the International Childhood Cancer Cohort Consortium (I4C).,10.1002/ijc.31635 [doi],"The ""delayed infection hypothesis"" states that a paucity of infections in early childhood may lead to higher risks of childhood leukemia (CL), especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Using prospectively collected data from six population-based birth cohorts we studied the association between birth order (a proxy for pathogen exposure) and CL. We explored whether other birth or parental characteristics modify this association. With 2.2 x 10(6) person-years of follow-up, 185 CL and 136 ALL cases were ascertained. In Cox proportional hazards models, increasing birth order (continuous) was inversely associated with CL and ALL; hazard ratios (HR) = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): (0.77-0.99) and 0.85: (0.73-0.99), respectively. Being later-born was associated with similarly reduced hazards of CL and ALL compared to being first-born; HRs = 0.78: 95% CI: 0.58-1.05 and 0.73: 0.52-1.03, respectively. Successive birth orders were associated with decreased CL and ALL risks (P for trend 0.047 and 0.055, respectively). Multivariable adjustment somewhat attenuated the associations. We found statistically significant and borderline interactions between birth weight (p = 0.024) and paternal age (p = 0.067), respectively, in associations between being later-born and CL, with the lowest risk observed for children born at <3 kg with fathers aged 35+ (HR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.06-0.50). Our study strengthens the theory that increasing birth order confers protection against CL and ALL risks, but suggests that this association may be modified among subsets of children with different characteristics, notably advanced paternal age and lower birth weight. It is unclear whether these findings can be explained solely by infectious exposures.",['(c) 2018 UICC.'],"['Paltiel, Ora', 'Lemeshow, Stanley', 'Phillips, Gary S', 'Tikellis, Gabriella', 'Linet, Martha S', 'Ponsonby, Anne-Louise', 'Magnus, Per', 'Haberg, Siri E', 'Olsen, Sjurdur F', 'Granstrom, Charlotta', 'Klebanoff, Mark', 'Golding, Jean', 'Herceg, Zdenko', 'Ghantous, Akram', 'Hirst, Jane Elizabeth', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Ward, Mary H', 'Holst Soegaard, Signe', 'Dwyer, Terence']","['Paltiel O', 'Lemeshow S', 'Phillips GS', 'Tikellis G', 'Linet MS', 'Ponsonby AL', 'Magnus P', 'Haberg SE', 'Olsen SF', 'Granstrom C', 'Klebanoff M', 'Golding J', 'Herceg Z', 'Ghantous A', 'Hirst JE', 'Borkhardt A', 'Ward MH', 'Holst Soegaard S', 'Dwyer T']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8324-3873', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4109-3154']","['Braun School of Public Health and Community Medicine and Department of Hematology, Hadassah-Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Statistical consultant, Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Center for Biostatistics, Retired.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', ""Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Childrens Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Centre for Fertility and Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Fertility and Health, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Fetal Programming, Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Centre for Fetal Programming, Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Epidemiology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH."", 'Centre for Child and Adolescent Health, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom.', 'Epigenetics Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', 'Epigenetics Group, International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France.', ""Nuffield Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Oxford, Women's Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, University Children's Hospital, Medical Faculty, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany."", 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Rockville, MD.', 'Department of Epidemiology Research, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""The George Institute for Global Health, Nuffield Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, University of Oxford, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181026,United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adult', '*Birth Order', '*Birth Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Paternal Age', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*birth order', '*birth weight', '*childhood leukemia', '*cohort studies', '*paternal age']",,2018/08/12 06:00,2019/04/16 06:00,['2018/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/12 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/16 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.31635 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2019 Jan 1;144(1):26-33. doi: 10.1002/ijc.31635.

These infections are mostly life-threatening and an early diagnosis and initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy are essential for the clinical outcome. Most commonly, Aspergillus and Candida species are involved. However, other Non-Aspergillus moulds are increasingly identified in case of documented IFD. For definite diagnosis of IFD, a combination of diagnostic tools have to be applied, including conventional mycological culture and non-conventional microbiological tests such as antibody/antigen and molecular tests, as well as histopathology and radiology. Although varying widely in cancer patients, the risk of invasive fungal infection is highest in those with allogeneic stem cell transplantation and those with acute leukaemia and markedly lower in patients with solid cancer. Since the last edition of Diagnosis of Invasive Fungal Diseases recommendations of the German Society for Hematology and Oncology in 2012, integrated care pathways have been proposed for the management and therapy of IFDs with either a diagnostic driven strategy as opposed to a clinical or empirical driven strategy.

It is a high-cost continuous therapy differing from other regimens that are given for much shorter courses. Our objective was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib for first-line treatment of CLL in patients older than age 65 years without a 17p deletion. We developed a semi-Markov model to analyze the cost-effectiveness of ibrutinib vs a comparator therapy from a US Medicare perspective. No direct comparison between ibrutinib and the best available treatment alternative, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil (chemoimmunotherapy), exists. Therefore, we compared ibrutinib to a theoretical treatment alternative, which was modeled to confer the effectiveness of an inferior treatment (chlorambucil alone) and the costs and adverse events of chemoimmunotherapy, which would provide ibrutinib with the best chance of being cost-effective. Even so, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of ibrutinib vs the modeled comparator was $189 000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. To reach a willingness-to-pay threshold (WTP) of $150 000 per QALY, the monthly cost of ibrutinib would have to be at most $6800, $1700 less than the modeled cost of $8500 per month (a reduction of $20 400 per year). When the comparator efficacy is increased to more closely match that seen in trials evaluating chemoimmunotherapy, ibrutinib costs more than $262 000 per QALY gained, and the monthly cost of ibrutinib would need to be lowered to less than $5000 per month to be cost-effective. Ibrutinib is not cost-effective as initial therapy at a WTP threshold of $150 000 per QALY gained.",,"['Barnes, James I', 'Divi, Vasu', 'Begaye, Adrian', 'Wong, Russell', 'Coutre, Steven', 'Owens, Douglas K', 'Goldhaber-Fiebert, Jeremy D']","['Barnes JI', 'Divi V', 'Begaye A', 'Wong R', 'Coutre S', 'Owens DK', 'Goldhaber-Fiebert JD']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7897-919X'],"['Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research/Center for Health Policy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine.', 'Department of Management Science and Engineering, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, CA.', 'Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research/Center for Health Policy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine.', 'Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research/Center for Health Policy, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'Chromosome 17 deletion']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/economics', 'Male', '*Models, Economic', 'Piperidines', '*Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/economics', '*Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/economics', 'Smith-Magenis Syndrome']",PMC6093732,,,,2018/08/12 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/08/12 06:00'],"['2017/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2017015461 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015461 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Aug 14;2(15):1946-1956. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2017015461.,15,1946-1956,['K01 AG037593/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most studies have investigated the second-generation CARs with either CD28 or 4-1BB costimulatory domains in the CAR receptor. Here, we describe the first clinical phase I/IIa trial using third-generation CAR T cells targeting CD19 to evaluate safety and efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients with B-cell lymphoma or leukemia were treated with CAR T cells. The patients with lymphoma received chemotherapy during CAR manufacture and 11 of 15 were given low-dose cyclophosphamide and fludarabine conditioning prior to CAR infusion. Peripheral blood was sampled before and at multiple time points after CAR infusion to evaluate the persistence of CAR T cells and for immune profiling, using quantitative PCR, flow cytometry, and a proteomic array. RESULTS: Treatment with third-generation CAR T cells was generally safe with 4 patients requiring hospitalization due to adverse reactions. Six of the 15 patients had initial complete responses [4/11 lymphoma and 2/4 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)], and 3 of the patients with lymphoma were in remission at 3 months. Two patients are still alive. Best predictor of response was a good immune status prior to CAR infusion with high IL12, DC-Lamp, Fas ligand, and TRAIL. Responding patients had low monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs; CD14(+)CD33(+)HLA(-)DR(-)) and low levels of IL6, IL8, NAP3, sPDL1, and sPDL2. CONCLUSIONS: Third-generation CARs may be efficient in patients with advanced B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy with only modest toxicity.

A meta-analysis was performed to clarify these associations. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant prospective observational studies. A random-effects model was used to generate the summary relative risks (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). A total of 22 prospective cohort studies, with over 20,000 NHL cases, were included in the present meta-analysis. The summary RRs of NHL risk were 1.06 (95% CI 1.03, 1.09) for each 5kg/m(2) increase in body mass index (BMI), 1.11 (95% CI 1.07, 1.16) for each 5kg/m(2) increase in BMI in early adulthood (age 18-21 years), 1.05 (95% CI 1.01, 1.09) for each 10kg increase in weight, 1.21 (95% CI 1.15, 1.28) for each 10kg increase in weight in early adulthood (age 18-21 years), and 1.13 (95% CI 1.10, 1.17) for each 10cm increase in height. No association was found for waist circumference (WC) and waist-to-hip ratio. By subtypes, all anthropometric factors (but not WC) were associated with an increased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma was positively associated with BMI in early adulthood and with height, whereas follicular lymphoma was only positively associated with height. In summary, BMI and weight in early adulthood may be more relevant to NHL development than current BMI and weight. These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy weight throughout the life-course, starting from early life, for NHL prevention. Increased NHL risk with taller stature, which may reflect cumulative exposure to hormones/growth factors and nutrition status in early life, further supports the relevance of early life exposure in the etiology of NHL.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Replicating the ecotropic MLVs recombines with polytropic (P-ERVs) and xenotropic ERVs (X-ERVs) to generate pathogenic viruses with an altered host range. While most recovered nonecotropic recombinants have a polytropic host range, the X-MLVs are also present in the pre-leukemic tissues. We analyzed two such isolates from the AKR mice to identify their ERV progenitors and to look for evidence of recombination. AKR40 resembles the active X-ERV Bxv1, while AKR6 has a Bxv1-like backbone with substitutions that alter the long terminal repeat (LTR) enhancer and the envelope (env). AKR6 has a modified xenotropic host range, and its Env residue changes all lie outside of the domain that governs the receptor choice. The AKR6 segment spanning the two substitutions, but not the entire AKR6 env-LTR, exists as an ERV, termed Xmv67, in AKR, but not in the C57BL/6 mice. This suggests that AKR6 is the product of one, not two, recombination events. Xmv67 originated in the Asian mice. These data indicate that the recombinant X-MLVs that can be generated during lymphomagenesis, describe a novel X-ERV subtype found in the AKR genome, but not in the C57BL/6 reference genome, and identify residues in the envelope C-terminus that may influence the host range.",,"['Bamunusinghe, Devinka', 'Skorski, Matthew', 'Buckler-White, Alicia', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Bamunusinghe D', 'Skorski M', 'Buckler-White A', 'Kozak CA']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. devinka123@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. mattskorski@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. abwhite@niaid.nih.gov.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD 20892-0460, USA. ckozak@niaid.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",20180809,Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*genetics', '*Evolution, Molecular', 'Gammaretrovirus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genome, Viral', 'Host Specificity', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences']",PMC6116186,['NOTNLM'],"['*endogenous retroviruses', '*recombinant retrovirus', '*retroviral origins', '*xenotropic gammaretrovirus']",,2018/08/12 06:00,2019/03/14 06:00,['2018/08/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/28 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [medline]']","['v10080418 [pii]', '10.3390/v10080418 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2018 Aug 9;10(8). pii: v10080418. doi: 10.3390/v10080418.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ectopic expression of CDX2 has been frequently observed in acute myeloid and lymphoid leukemia which in most cases is concomitant with poor prognosis. Induction of CDX2 in mice leads to hematologic complications, showing the leukemogenic origin of this gene. CDX2 plays significant role in the most critical pathways as the regulator of important transcription factors targeting cell proliferation, multi-drug resistance and survival. On the whole, the results indicate that CDX2 has the potential to be suggested as the diagnostic marker in hematologic malignancies.

We assessed the probability of having a multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB) bloodstream infection (BSI) 24 h after cultures were taken, to use this information for antibiotic de-escalation strategies. METHODS: BSI episodes were prospectively collected (2003-2017). When a patient experienced more than one BSI, only one episode was randomly chosen. Time elapsed from the beginning of incubation to a positive reading was observed; TTP was recorded when the first bottle had a positive result. RESULTS: Of the 850 patient-unique episodes, 323 (38%) occurred in acute leukaemia, 185 (21.8%) in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 144 (16.9%) in solid neoplasms. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (225; 26.5%), Escherichia coli (207; 26.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (136; 16%), Enterococcus spp. (81; 9.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (67; 7.9%), were the most frequent microorganisms isolated. MDR-GNB were documented in 126 (14.8%) episodes. Median TTP was 12 h (interquartile range 9-16.5 h). Within the first 24 h, 92.1% of blood cultures were positive (783/850). No MDR-GNB was positive over 24 h. Of the 67 (7.9%) episodes with a TTP >/=24 h, 25 (37.3%) occurred in patients who were already receiving active antibiotics against the isolated pathogen. Most common isolations with TTP >/=24 h were coagulase-negative staphylococci, candidaemia and a group of anaerobic GNB. CONCLUSIONS: Currently, the vast majority of BSI in individuals with onco-haematological diseases with febrile neutropenia have a TTP <24 h, including all episodes caused by MDR-GNB. Our results support reassessing empiric antibiotic treatment in neutropenic patients at 24 h, to apply antibiotic stewardship de-escalation strategies.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, murine antibodies cannot be safely used in patients because of their strong immune reaction, humanization of the antibodies interested will be an important development step for therapeutic purpose. The aim of this study was to engineer the mouse 3A4 and to investigate the biological activity of its chimeric form. The humanized antibody composed of the 3A4 single-chain fragment of variable region and the human IgG1 Fc region, which was named human-mouse chimeric antibody 3A4 (Hm3A4). The function and biological activities of Hm3A4 were characterized using a variety of biological approaches. The results showed that Hm3A4 retained a strong binding activity to its antigen and could significantly block the binding of parental 3A4 to the antigen. In vitro experiments revealed that Hm3A4 could kill the target cells through complement-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function. In vivo, Hm3A4 showed efficient antileukemia activity outperforming the nontreated mice.

METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was accessed, and a cohort of women diagnosed with a primary ovarian, uterine, or cervical malignancy between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 2014, who received chemotherapy was selected. Those who subsequently developed AML were identified. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and excess risk (ER) per 10,000 persons were calculated. Median overall survival of women with t-AML was calculated following generation of Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: We identified 60,130 women who met the inclusion criteria; 56.4%, 19.4%, and 24.2% were diagnosed with ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancer, respectively. A total of 79 patients (0.13%) developed t-AML. The calculated SIR was 4.41 (95% CI, 3.49-5.50). For women with ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancer, the SIRs were 4.25 (95% CI, 3.13-5.66), 5.33 (95% CI, 2.92-8.95), and 4.26, (95% CI, 2.52-6.73), respectively. The highest risk was observed among women younger than 50 years (SIR, 11.69; 95% CI, 7.56-17.25).

Here we report our evaluation of presenting white blood cell (WBC) and the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) scoring system as markers for early death and nonlethal coagulopathy in pediatric APL. We evaluated 79 pediatric patients treated on a Children's Oncology Group phase III clinical trial. There were 4 early deaths and 13 nonlethal, clinically significant (grade III to IV) coagulopathy events during induction. Elevated presenting WBC was significantly associated with early death but not with both lethal and nonlethal coagulopathy events. An ISTH DIC score of >/=5 (the original ISTH criteria for overt DIC) was not associated with either early deaths or coagulopathy events. An ISTH DIC score threshold of 6, however, was significantly associated with early death (12% score >/=6 vs. 0% score <6) and with both lethal and nonlethal coagulopathy events (35% score >/=6 vs. 11% score <6). In pediatric APL patients, the presenting WBC is a marker for risk of early death. Although the ISTH score using a cutoff of >/=6 showed improved correlation with adverse coagulation events during induction, the sensitivity was only 70.6% (95% confidence interval, 44.0%-89.7%) and the specificity was 64.5% (95% confidence interval, 51.3%-76.3%).

The safety of deescalating antibiotic therapy in pediatric patients with leukemia and neutropenia is incompletely understood. METHODS: A retrospective chart review of 194 FN episodes occurred between the years of 2013 and 2016 in 67 patients with leukemia. Clinical and microbiologic data were recorded. RESULTS: MD-BSI occurred in 36 of 194 (18%) of FN episodes. Deescalation of empiric antibiotic therapy based on antibiotic susceptibilities was possible in 25 of 36 (69.4%) episodes. In those 25 episodes, where there was an opportunity to deescalate the antibiotic spectrum, it was clinically appropriate to do so in 19. Deescalation occurred in 9 (47.4%) of these episodes without complication. The remaining 10 patients received a median of 20 additional days of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (range, 12 to 30 d). CONCLUSIONS: In our small cohort of patients, deescalation of antibiotic therapy based on antimicrobial susceptibilities did not result in complication.

The production of NC cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is a valuable approach to study human NC biology. However, the origin of human trunk NC remains undefined and current in vitro differentiation strategies induce only a modest yield of trunk NC cells. Here we show that hPSC-derived axial progenitors, the posteriorly-located drivers of embryonic axis elongation, give rise to trunk NC cells and their derivatives. Moreover, we define the molecular signatures associated with the emergence of human NC cells of distinct axial identities in vitro. Collectively, our findings indicate that there are two routes toward a human post-cranial NC state: the birth of cardiac and vagal NC is facilitated by retinoic acid-induced posteriorisation of an anterior precursor whereas trunk NC arises within a pool of posterior axial progenitors.","['(c) 2018, Frith et al.']","['Frith, Thomas Jr', 'Granata, Ilaria', 'Wind, Matthew', 'Stout, Erin',

PROCEDURE: Through the SickKids-Caribbean Initiative (SCI), we established a multicenter childhood cancer database across seven centers in six ESC countries. Data managers entered patient demographics, disease, treatment, and outcome data. Data collection commenced in 2013, with retrospective collection to 2011 and subsequent prospective collection. RESULTS: A total of 367 children were diagnosed between 2011 and 2015 with a median age of 5.7 years (interquartile range 2.9-10.6 years). One hundred thirty (35.4%) patients were diagnosed with leukemia, 30 (8.2%) with lymphoma, and 149 (40.6%) with solid tumors. A relative paucity of children with brain tumors was seen (N = 58, 15.8%). Two-year event-free survival (EFS) for the cohort was 48.5% +/- 3.2%; 2-year overall survival (OS) was 55.1% +/- 3.1%. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Wilms tumor (WT) experienced better 2-year EFS (62.1% +/- 6.4% and 66.7% +/- 10.1%), while dismal outcomes were seen in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML; 22.7 +/- 9.6%), rhabdomyosarcoma (21.0% +/- 17.0%), and medulloblastoma (21.4% +/- 17.8%). Of 108 deaths with known cause, 58 (53.7%) were attributed to disease and 50 (46.3%) to treatment complications. Death within 60 days of diagnosis was relatively common in acute leukemia [13/98 (13.3%) ALL, 8/26 (30.8%) AML]. Despite this, traditional prognosticators adversely impacted outcome in ALL, including higher age, higher white blood cell count, and T-cell lineage. CONCLUSIONS: ESC childhood cancer outcomes are significantly inferior to high-income country outcomes. Based on these data, interventions for improving supportive care and modifying treatment protocols are under way. Continued data collection will allow evaluation of interventions and ensure maximal outcome improvements.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Gibson, T N', 'Beeput, S', 'Gaspard, J', 'George, C', 'Gibson, D', 'Jackson, N', 'Leandre-Broome, V', 'Palmer-Mitchell, N', 'Alexis, C', 'Bird-Compton, J', 'Bodkyn, C', 'Boyle, R', 'McLean-Salmon, S', 'Reece-Mills, M', 'Quee-Brown, C Sin', 'Allen, U', 'Weitzman, S', 'Blanchette, V', 'Gupta, S']","['Gibson TN', 'Beeput S', 'Gaspard J', 'George C', 'Gibson D', 'Jackson N', 'Leandre-Broome V', 'Palmer-Mitchell N', 'Alexis C', 'Bird-Compton J', 'Bodkyn C', 'Boyle R', 'McLean-Salmon S', 'Reece-Mills M', 'Quee-Brown CS', 'Allen U', 'Weitzman S', 'Blanchette V', 'Gupta S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1334-3670'],"['The University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Bustamante Hospital for Children, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Victoria Hospital, Castries, St. Lucia.', 'Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mount Hope, Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Nassau, Bahamas.', 'Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown, Barbados.', 'The University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Bridgetown, Barbados.', 'Victoria Hospital, Castries, St. Lucia.', 'Eric Williams Medical Sciences Complex, Mount Hope, Trinidad and Tobago.', 'Milton Cato Memorial Hospital, Kingstown, St. Vincent and the Grenadines.', 'Bustamante Hospital for Children, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'The University Hospital of the West Indies, Kingston, Jamaica.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital, Nassau, Bahamas.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",20180809,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Caribbean Region/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/blood/*mortality/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Caribbean', '*cancer', '*child', '*databases', '*low- and middle-income countries', '*survival outcomes']",,2018/08/11 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27298 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Dec;65(12):e27298. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27298.

Our objective was to determine whether use of specific guidelines developed by the Children's Oncology Group (COG) when preparing a lay summary would aid in understanding results. Specifically, to determine if caregivers of childhood cancer survivors found a lay summary comprehensive, easy to understand, and helpful following participation in a computerized cognitive training program. Methods: In a previous study, 68 childhood survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia or brain tumor with identified cognitive deficits were randomly assigned to participate in a computerized cognitive intervention or assigned to a wait list. Following conclusion of this study, participants' caregivers were contacted and provided with a summary of results based on COG guidelines and survey. Forty-three participants returned the surveys, examining caregivers' interpretation of the summary, reaction to the results, and information regarding preference for receiving results. Results: Caregivers reported results as important (93%), helpful (93%), easy to understand (98%), and relevant to their child (91%). They interpreted the results as generally positive, with many caregivers endorsing satisfaction (84%); however, concern of long-term implications was expressed (25%). Most preferred receiving results through postal letter (88%) or email (47%). Conclusions: Benefits of returning research results to families appear to outweigh potential negative consequences. Returning results may help inform families when making future health care-related decisions. There is a great need to develop and assess the utility of guidelines for returning research results.",,"['Scott, Sarah M', 'Ashford, Jason M', 'Clark, Kellie N', 'Martin-Elbahesh, Karen', 'Conklin, Heather M']","['Scott SM', 'Ashford JM', 'Clark KN', 'Martin-Elbahesh K', 'Conklin HM']",,"[""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN, USA."", ""Department of Psychology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis TN, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20171119,England,Neurooncol Pract,Neuro-oncology practice,101640528,,,,PMC6075540,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'brain tumor', 'pediatric', 'research results']",,2018/08/11 06:00,2018/08/11 06:01,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/nop/npx029 [doi]', 'npx029 [pii]']",ppublish,Neurooncol Pract. 2018 Aug;5(3):194-200. doi: 10.1093/nop/npx029.

Of 344 eligible patients who had received ATRA and chemotherapy, 319 (93%) achieved complete remission (CR). After completion of three courses of consolidation chemotherapy, 269 patients in molecular remission underwent maintenance randomization, 135 to ATRA (45 mg/m(2) daily), and 134 to tamibarotene (6 mg/m(2) daily) for 14 days every 3 months for 2 years. The primary endpoint was relapse-free survival (RFS). The 7-year RFS was 84% in the ATRA arm and 93% in the tamibarotene arm (p = 0.027, HR = 0.44, 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.93). The difference was prominent in high-risk patients with initial leukocytes >/= 10.0 x 10(9)/L (62% vs. 89%; p = 0.034). Tamibarotene was significantly superior to ATRA by decreasing relapse in high-risk patients. Overall survival after randomization did not differ (96% vs. 97%; p = 0.520).

The latter includes the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases that catalyze histone H3 lysine 4 di- and tri-methylation associated with gene activation. One such member, MLL1, is widely expressed in the central nervous system including the retina. However, its role in retinal development is unknown. To address this question, we knocked out Mll1 in mouse retinal progenitors, and discovered that MLL1 plays multiple roles in retinal development by regulating progenitor cell proliferation, cell type composition and neuron-glia balance, maintenance of horizontal neurons, and formation of functional synapses between neuronal layers required for visual signal transmission and processing. Altogether, our results suggest that MLL1 is indispensable for retinal neurogenesis and function development, providing a new paradigm for cell type-specific roles of known histone modifying enzymes during CNS tissue development.",,"['Brightman, Diana S', 'Grant, Rachel L', 'Ruzycki, Philip A', 'Suzuki, Ray', 'Hennig, Anne K', 'Chen, Shiming']","['Brightman DS', 'Grant RL', 'Ruzycki PA', 'Suzuki R', 'Hennig AK', 'Chen S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9299-5767'],"['Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Molecular Cell Biology graduate program, Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, ML 4006, Cincinnati, OH, 45229, USA."", 'College of Arts and Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Molecular Genetics and Genomics graduate program, Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'College of Arts and Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA.', 'Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA. chenshiming@wustl.edu.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, Washington University, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA. chenshiming@wustl.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180809,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Essential/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics/metabolism', 'Neural Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Neurogenesis/*genetics', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Retina/cytology/growth & development/*metabolism']",PMC6085291,,,,2018/08/11 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-30355-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-30355-3 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 9;8(1):11902. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30355-3.,1,11902,"['P30 EY002687/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY012543/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 EY013360/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ATRA inhibits leukemia, breast, and liver cancer by targeting isomerase Pin1, a master regulator of oncogenic signaling networks. Here we show that ATO targets Pin1 and cooperates with ATRA to exert potent anticancer activity. ATO inhibits and degrades Pin1, and suppresses its oncogenic function by noncovalent binding to Pin1's active site. ATRA increases cellular ATO uptake through upregulating aquaporin-9. ATO and ATRA, at clinically safe doses, cooperatively ablate Pin1 to block numerous cancer-driving pathways and inhibit the growth of triple-negative breast cancer cells and tumor-initiating cells in cell and animal models including patient-derived orthotopic xenografts, like Pin1 knockout, which is substantiated by comprehensive protein and microRNA analyses.

In t(8;21)+ acute myeloid leukemia, RUNX1 is fused to nearly the entire ETO protein, which contains four conserved nervy homology regions, NHR1-4. Furthermore RUNX1/ETO interacts with ETO-homologous proteins via NHR2, thereby multiplying NHR domain contacts. As shown recently, RUNX1/ETO retains oncogenic activity upon either deletion of the NHR3 + 4 N-CoR/SMRT interaction domain or substitution of the NHR2 tetramer domain. Thus, we aimed to clarify the specificities of the NHR domains. A C-terminally NHR3 + 4 truncated RUNX1/ETO containing a heterologous, structurally highly related non-NHR2 tetramer interface translocated into the nucleus and bound to RUNX1 consensus motifs. However, it failed to interact with ETO-homologues, repress RUNX1 targets, and transform progenitors. Surprisingly, transforming capacity was fully restored by C-terminal fusion with ETO's NHR4 zinc-finger or the repressor domain 3 of N-CoR, while other repression domains failed. With an inducible protein assembly system, we further demonstrated that NHR4 domain activity is critically required early in the establishment of progenitor cultures expressing the NHR2 exchanged truncated RUNX1/ETO. Together, we can show that NHR2 and NHR4 domains can be replaced by heterologous protein domains conferring tetramerization and repressor functions, thus showing that the NHR2 and NHR4 domain structures do not have irreplaceable functions concerning RUNX1/ETO activity for the establishment of human CD34+ cell expansion. We could resemble the function of RUNX1/ETO through modular recomposition with protein domains from RUNX1, ETO, BCR and N-CoR without any NHR2 and NHR4 sequences. As most transcriptional repressor proteins do not comprise tetramerization domains, our results provide a possible explanation as to the reason that RUNX1 is recurrently found translocated to ETO family members, which all contain tetramer together with transcriptional repressor moieties.",,"['Chen-Wichmann, Linping', 'Shvartsman, Marina', 'Preiss, Caro', 'Hockings, Colin', 'Windisch, Roland', 'Redondo Monte, Enric', 'Leubolt, Georg', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Lausen, Jorn', 'Brendel, Christian', 'Grez, Manuel', 'Greif, Philipp A', 'Wichmann, Christian']","['Chen-Wichmann L', 'Shvartsman M', 'Preiss C', 'Hockings C', 'Windisch R', 'Redondo Monte E', 'Leubolt G', 'Spiekermann K', 'Lausen J', 'Brendel C', 'Grez M', 'Greif PA', 'Wichmann C']",,"['Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Johann-Wolfgang-Goethe University and German Red Cross Blood Service, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."", 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilians University Hospital Munich, Munich, Germany. christian.wichmann@med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180809,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Domains', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,,2018/08/11 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2017/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/14 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0441-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0441-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Jan;38(2):261-272. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0441-7.

Thirteen patients 55 years and older with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were enrolled. Oral TDZ was administered at 3 dose levels: 25 mg (n = 6), 50 mg (n = 4), or 100 mg (n = 3) every 6 hours for 21 days. Intermediate-dose cytarabine was administered on days 6 to 10. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) included grade 3 QTc interval prolongation in 1 patient at 25 mg TDZ and neurological events in 2 patients at 100 mg TDZ (gait disturbance, depressed consciousness, and dizziness). At the 50-mg TDZ dose, the sum of circulating DRD2 antagonist levels approached a concentration of 10 muM, a level noted to be selectively active against human AML in vitro. Eleven of 13 patients completed a 5-day lead-in with TDZ, of which 6 received TDZ with hydroxyurea and 5 received TDZ alone. During this period, 8 patients demonstrated a 19% to 55% reduction in blast levels, whereas 3 patients displayed progressive disease. The extent of blast reduction during this 5-day interval was associated with the expression of the putative TDZ target receptor DRD2 on leukemic cells. These preliminary results suggest that DRD2 represents a potential therapeutic target for AML disease. Future studies are required to corroborate these observations, including the use of modified DRD2 antagonists with improved tolerability in AML patients.

Here, we describe preclinical investigations of ARQ 531, a potent, reversible inhibitor of BTK with additional activity against Src family kinases and kinases related to ERK signaling. We hypothesized that targeting additional kinases would improve global inhibition of signaling pathways, producing more robust responses. In vitro treatment of patient CLL cells with ARQ 531 decreases BTK-mediated functions including B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, viability, migration, CD40 and CD86 expression, and NF-kappaB gene transcription. In vivo, ARQ 531 was found to increase survival over ibrutinib in a murine Emu-TCL1 engraftment model of CLL and a murine Emu-MYC/TCL1 engraftment model resembling Richter transformation. Additionally, ARQ 531 inhibits CLL cell survival and suppresses BCR-mediated activation of C481S BTK and PLCgamma2 mutants, which facilitate clinical resistance to ibrutinib.Significance: This study characterizes a rationally designed kinase inhibitor with efficacy in models recapitulating the most common mechanisms of acquired resistance to ibrutinib. Reversible BTK inhibition is a promising strategy to combat progressive CLL, and multikinase inhibition demonstrates superior efficacy to targeted ibrutinib therapy in the setting of Richter transformation.

We designed and validated a high-throughput sequencing method for minimal residual disease assessment of cell clonotypes with mutations of NPM1, IDH1/2 and/or FLT3-single nucleotide variants. For clinical validation, 106 follow-up samples from 63 patients in complete remission were studied by sequencing, evaluating the level of mutations detected at diagnosis. The predictive value of minimal residual disease status by sequencing, multiparameter flow cytometry, or quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis was determined by survival analysis. The sequencing method achieved a sensitivity of 10(-4) for single nucleotide variants and 10(-5) for insertions/deletions and could be used in acute myeloid leukemia patients who carry any mutation (86% in our diagnostic data set). Sequencing-determined minimal residual disease positive status was associated with lower disease-free survival (hazard ratio 3.4, P=0.005) and lower overall survival (hazard ratio 4.2, P<0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that minimal residual disease positive status determined by sequencing was an independent factor associated with risk of death (hazard ratio 4.54, P=0.005) and the only independent factor conferring risk of relapse (hazard ratio 3.76, P=0.012). This sequencing-based method simplifies and standardizes minimal residual disease evaluation, with high applicability in acute myeloid leukemia. It is also an improvement upon flow cytometry- and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based prediction of outcomes of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and could be incorporated in clinical settings and clinical trials.",['Copyright (c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Onecha, Esther', 'Linares, Maria', 'Rapado, Inmaculada', 'Ruiz-Heredia, Yanira', 'Martinez-Sanchez, Pilar', 'Cedena, Teresa', 'Pratcorona, Marta', 'Oteyza, Jaime Perez', 'Herrera, Pilar', 'Barragan, Eva', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Vela, Jose Antonio Garcia', 'Magro, Elena', 'Anguita, Eduardo', 'Figuera, Angela', 'Riaza, Rosalia', 'Martinez-Barranco, Pilar', 'Sanchez-Vega, Beatriz', 'Nomdedeu, Josep', 'Gallardo, Miguel', 'Martinez-Lopez, Joaquin', 'Ayala, Rosa']","['Onecha E', 'Linares M', 'Rapado I', 'Ruiz-Heredia Y', 'Martinez-Sanchez P', 'Cedena T', 'Pratcorona M', 'Oteyza JP', 'Herrera P', 'Barragan E', 'Montesinos P', 'Vela JAG', 'Magro E', 'Anguita E', 'Figuera A', 'Riaza R', 'Martinez-Barranco P', 'Sanchez-Vega B', 'Nomdedeu J', 'Gallardo M', 'Martinez-Lopez J', 'Ayala R']",,"['Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid.', 'Complutense University, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Sanchinarro, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal, Madrid.', 'Complutense University, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.', 'Complutense University, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario de Getafe, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Clinico San Carlos, IdISSC, UCM, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Severo Ochoa, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario Fundacion Alcorcon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid.', 'Complutense University, Madrid.', 'Hematology Department, Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre, Madrid rosam.ayala@salud.madrid.org.', 'Hematological Malignancies Clinical Research Unit, CNIO, Madrid.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), Madrid.', 'Complutense University, Madrid.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180809,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Female', '*High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Workflow']",PMC6355493,,,,2018/08/11 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2018/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.194712 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.194712 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Feb;104(2):288-296. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.194712.

Frequency, risk factors, and outcomes associated with pleural effusion were assessed in two phase 3 trials (DASISION and 034/Dose-optimization) and a pooled population of 11 trials that evaluated patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with dasatinib (including DASISION and 034/Dose-optimization). In this largest assessment of patients across the dasatinib clinical trial program (N=2712), pleural effusion developed in 6-9% of patients at risk annually in DASISION, and in 5-15% of patients at risk annually in 034/Dose-optimization. With a minimum follow up of 5 and 7 years, drug-related pleural effusion occurred in 28% of patients in DASISION and in 33% of patients in 034/Dose-optimization, respectively.

Beside its physiological expression pattern, aberrant HB9 expression has been observed in several neoplasias. Especially in infant translocation t(7;12) acute myeloid leukemia, aberrant HB9 expression is the only known molecular hallmark and is assumed to be a key factor in leukemic transformation. However, so far, only poor functional data exist addressing the oncogenic potential of HB9 or its influence on hematopoiesis. We investigated the influence of HB9 on cell proliferation and cell cycle in vitro, as well as on hematopoietic stem cell differentiation in vivo using murine and human model systems. In vitro, HB9 expression led to premature senescence in human HT1080 and murine NIH3T3 cells, providing for the first time evidence for an oncogenic potential of HB9. Onset of senescence was characterized by induction of the p53-p21 tumor suppressor network, resulting in growth arrest, accompanied by morphological transformation and expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase. In vivo, HB9-transduced primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells underwent a profound differentiation arrest and accumulated at the megakaryocyte/erythrocyte progenitor stage. In line, gene expression analyses revealed de novo expression of erythropoiesis-related genes in human CD34(+)hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells upon HB9 expression. In summary, the novel findings of HB9-dependent premature senescence and myeloid-biased perturbed hematopoietic differentiation, for the first time shed light on the oncogenic properties of HB9 in translocation t(7;12) acute myeloid leukemia.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Ingenhag, Deborah', 'Reister, Sven', 'Auer, Franziska', 'Bhatia, Sanil', 'Wildenhain, Sarah', 'Picard, Daniel', 'Remke, Marc', 'Hoell, Jessica I', 'Kloetgen, Andreas', 'Sohn, Dennis', 'Janicke, Reiner U', 'Koegler, Gesine', 'Borkhardt, Arndt', 'Hauer, Julia']","['Ingenhag D', 'Reister S', 'Auer F', 'Bhatia S', 'Wildenhain S', 'Picard D', 'Remke M', 'Hoell JI', 'Kloetgen A', 'Sohn D', 'Janicke RU', 'Koegler G', 'Borkhardt A', 'Hauer J']",,"['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Neuro-Oncogenomics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Neuro-Oncogenomics, German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Computational Biology of Infection Research, Helmholtz Center for Infection Research, Braunschweig.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Radiooncology, Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Radiooncology, Clinic and Policlinic for Radiation Therapy and Radiooncology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Institute for Transplantation Diagnostics and Cell Therapeutics, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Medical Faculty of Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf Julia.Hauer@med.uni-duesseldorf.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180809,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '140115-73-7 (Hb9 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",PMC6312034,,,,2018/08/11 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.189407 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.189407 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jan;104(1):35-46. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.189407.

To investigate in depth the role of ASXL2 in normal hematopoiesis, we utilized a mouse model of ASXL2 deficiency.

We developed a novel strategy using CIKs from banked cryopreserved cord blood units (CBUs) combined with bispecific antibody (BsAb) blinatumomab to treat CD19(+) malignancies. METHODS: CB-CIKs were expanded in vitro and fully characterized in comparison with peripheral blood (PB)-derived CIKs. RESULTS: CB-CIKs, like PB-CIKs, were mostly CD3(+) T cells with mean 45% CD3(+)CD56(+) and expressing mostly TCR(T cell receptor)alphabeta with a TH1 phenotype. CB-CIK cultures had, however, a larger proportion of CD4(+) cells, mostly CD56(-), as well as a greater proportion of naive CCR7(+)CD45RA(+) and a lower percentage of effector memory cells, compared with PB-CIKs. CB-CIKs were very similar to PB-CIKs in their expression of a large panel of co-stimulatory and inhibitory/exhaustion markers, except for higher CD28 expression among CD8(+) cells. Like PB-CIKs, CB-CIKs were highly cytotoxic in vitro against natural killer (NK) cell targets and efficiently lysed CD19(+) tumor cells in the presence of blinatumomab, with 30-60% lysis of target cells at very low effector:target ratios. Finally, both CB-CIKs and PB-CIKs, combined with blinatumomab, showed significant therapeutic activity in an aggressive PDX Ph(+) CD19(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia model in NOD-SCID mice, without sign of toxicity or graft-versus-host disease. The improved expansion protocol was finally validated in good manufacturing practice conditions, showing reproducible expansion of CIKs from cryopreserved cord blood units with a median of 28.8x10(6) CIK/kg. DISCUSSION: We conclude that CB-CIKs, combined with bispecific T-cell-engaging antibodies, offer a novel, effective treatment strategy for leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2018 International Society for Cellular Therapy.

Moreover, TKI therapy enables patients to experience long-term survival, with survival rates similar to those of individuals without CML. This enhanced survival has resulted from the availability of multiple BCR-ABL1 TKIs with efficacy, not only in frontline treatment, but, importantly, also in second- and third-line treatment. We have reviewed the changes in long-term outcomes in the era of TKI therapy and how these changes have affected treatment practices. We discuss the development of imatinib, the first BCR-ABL1 TKI, followed by newer TKIs, including nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib. We consider the key studies that led to their development as frontline or later-line therapies, their safety profiles, and their effect on improving patient outcomes. With these improved outcomes, the definition of an optimal response has become more stringent, and treatment monitoring strategies have changed. Second-line patient populations have evolved from those with resistance to, or intolerance of, imatinib to those with moderate responses to, or low-grade adverse events with, imatinib. Although all TKIs are associated with high survival rates, newer TKIs have been associated with lower disease progression rates and, importantly, deeper treatment responses and, potentially, a greater chance of future treatment-free remission. Finally, we consider the unmet needs of patients with CML, including the challenges remaining for those without optimal responses during TKI therapy and new therapies and strategies to identify such patients at diagnosis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

We performed an age-, gender- and residence frequency-matched case-control study of 101 blood cancer patients under 18 years of age, all of which were treated in Amirkola Pediatric Hospital. One hundred and thirty-eight control samples were gathered from the outpatient clinic in the hospital. All cases and controls were tested for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibodies and then IgG-positive subjects were evaluated for IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassays. Anti-T. gondii IgG antibodies were found in 37 (36.6%) of the cases and 12 (8.7%) subjects in the control group (odds ratio 6.07, 95% confidence interval 2.963-12.437, P < 0.0001). The median and interquartile range (IQR) of IgG titre from case group (7.7 (IQR 0.25-13.5)) was higher than the control (0.2 (IQR 0.1-0.5)) (P < 0.0001). The frequency of anti-T. gondii antibodies (IgG) in lymphoblastic leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), Hodgkin's lymphoma and T-cell lymphoma were 33 (31.9%), 3 (50%) and 1(100%), respectively. Anti-T. gondii IgM was not detected in the IgG-positive patients in case group. In the case subjects, no significant difference was seen in the positive rates of T. gondii infection between genders (37.3% in male; 35.7% in female; P = 0.52) and ages groups (P = 0.31). This study demonstrated that T. gondii infection is prevalent in children with blood cancer.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the primary interest was in excluding the Philadelphia chromosome; a finding more common in older adults which uniformly predicted for a rapidly fatal outcome. Areas covered: Over the past 15 years, much has evolved. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors completely changed the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL. In addition, the genetic characterization of Ph-negative ALL has significantly advanced through systematic progressive analyses of genetic data from large trial groups. These led to specific and more accurate prognostication, particularly at initial diagnosis. Expert commentary: These cytogenetic and molecular features will be reviewed in this paper and their ongoing significance will be critically analyzed in the era of minimal residual disease (MRD) determination, which has now superseded all the major known historic prognostic factors.",,"['Horowitz, Netanel A', 'Akasha, Doaa', 'Rowe, Jacob M']","['Horowitz NA', 'Akasha D', 'Rowe JM']",,"['a Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Rambam Health Care Campus , Haifa , Israel.', 'b Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine , Technion , Haifa , Israel.', 'a Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Rambam Health Care Campus , Haifa , Israel.', 'a Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation , Rambam Health Care Campus , Haifa , Israel.', 'b Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine , Technion , Haifa , Israel.', 'c Department of Hematology , Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem , Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180816,England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prognosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)', '*allogeneic stem cell transplantation', '*minimal residual disease (MRD)', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)']",,2018/08/11 06:00,2019/04/12 06:00,['2018/08/11 06:00'],"['2018/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2018.1509702 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2018 Oct;11(10):781-791. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2018.1509702.

This study was designed to explore the anti-leukemia activity of physcion 8-O-beta-glucopyranoside (PG) in B-cell ALL. METHODS: NALM6 and SupB15 cells were used as model cell lines. Cell viability, cell apoptosis, cell cycle distribution were determined by CCK-8 assay, DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry, and flow cytometry, respectively. Expression of proteins involved in cell apoptosis and cell cycle regulation was determined by western blot and the levels of ceramide and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) were determined by ELISA. Activity of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) was also determined with a Sphingosine Kinase Assay Kit. In the present study, both model cell lines were transfected with siRNA targeting SphK1 or an overexpression plasmid to examine the role of SphK1 in the anti-leukemia activity of PG. Moreover, the efficacy of PG was examined in vivo in a mouse model by measuring survival and spleen weight. RESULTS: Our results provided experimental evidence that PG could significantly induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in vitro. Mechanistically, the anti-leukemia activity of PG was mediated by its ability to repress SphK1 and thus modulate ceramide-S1P rheostat. Moreover, the anti-leukemia activity of PG was also verified in a murine model. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our results indicate that PG may be a promising agent for the treatment of B-cell leukemia.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.', 'Published by Elsevier B.V.

Towards this aim, anticancer and antibacterial activities of CS-nanoparticles-linked zinc (Zn-CSNPs) were evaluated. The particle size of CSNPs was lowered (113.09nm) compared to Zn-CSNPs (160.7nm). Both nanoparticles (CSNPs and Zn-CSNPs) were spherical in shape, polydispersive and homogenous. Fourier transforms infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis confirmed the different molecular arrangement of NPs and the presence of Zn in Zn-CSNPs and CS in both NPs, respectively. Zn-CSNPs had higher inhibitory activity against tested pathogens with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 9.25-13.5mug.mL(-1) and showed the complete inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Zn-CSNPs have triggered the apoptosis through activation of first apoptosis signal receptor/cluster of differentiation 95 (Fas/CD95), and apoptotic-regulatory genes and caused 65-70% of cellular damage in human acute T-lymphocyte leukemia (6T-CEM) cells.

JAK2 clinical mutations cause myeloproliferative neoplasms and leukemia, and the mutations strongly concentrate in the regulatory pseudokinase domain Janus kinase homology (JH) 2. Current clinical JAK inhibitors target the tyrosine kinase domain and lack mutation and pathway selectivity. OBJECTIVE: We sought to characterize mechanisms and differences for pathogenic and cytokine-induced JAK2 activation to enable design of novel selective JAK inhibitors. METHODS: We performed a systematic analysis of JAK2 activation requirements using structure-guided mutagenesis, cell-signaling assays, microscopy, and biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Distinct structural requirements were identified for activation of different pathogenic mutations. Specifically, the predominant JAK2 mutation, V617F, is the most sensitive to structural perturbations in multiple JH2 elements (C helix [alphaC], Src homology 2-JH2 linker, and ATP binding site). In contrast, activation of K539L is resistant to most perturbations. Normal cytokine signaling shows distinct differences in activation requirements: JH2 ATP binding site mutations have only a minor effect on signaling, whereas JH2 alphaC mutations reduce homomeric (JAK2-JAK2) erythropoietin signaling and almost completely abrogate heteromeric (JAK2-JAK1) IFN-gamma signaling, potentially by disrupting a dimerization interface on JH2. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that therapeutic approaches targeting the JH2 ATP binding site and alphaC could be effective in inhibiting most pathogenic mutations. JH2 ATP site targeting has the potential for reduced side effects by retaining erythropoietin and IFN-gamma functions. Simultaneously, however, we identified the JH2 alphaC interface as a potential target for pathway-selective JAK inhibitors in patients with diseases with unmutated JAK2, thus providing new insights into the development of novel pharmacologic interventions.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

It has been shown that AHR is involved in normal hematopoietic progenitor proliferation in human cells. In addition, loss of AHR in knockout mice is accompanied by a myeloproliferative syndrome-like disease, suggesting a role of AHR in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) maintenance. To study the potential role of AHR pathway in CML progenitors and stem cells, we have first evaluated the expression of AHR in UT-7 cell line expressing BCR-ABL. AHR expression was highly reduced in UT-7 cell expressing BCR-ABL as compared to controls. AHR transcript levels, quantified in primary peripheral blood CML cells at diagnosis (n = 31 patients) were found to be significantly reduced compared to healthy controls (n = 15). The use of StemRegenin (SR1), an AHR antagonist, induced a marked expansion of total leukemic cells and leukemic CD34+ cells by about 4- and 10-fold respectively. SR1-treated CML CD34+ cells generated more colony-forming cells and long-term culture initiating cell (LTC-IC)-derived progenitors as compared to non-SR1-treated counterparts. Conversely, treatment of CML CD34+ cells with FICZ, a natural agonist of AHR, induced a 3-fold decrease in the number of CD34+ cells in culture after 7 days. Moreover, a 4-day FICZ treatment was sufficient to significantly reduce the clonogenic potential of CML CD34+ cells and this effect was synergized by Imatinib and Dasatinib treatments. Similarly, a 3-day FICZ treatment contributed to hinder significantly the number of LTC-IC-derived progenitors without synergistic effect with Imatinib. The analysis of molecular circuitry of AHR signaling in CML showed a transcriptional signature in CML derived CD34+ CD38- primitive cells with either low or high levels of AHR, with an upregulation of myeloid genes involved in differentiation in the ""AHR low"" fraction and an upregulation of genes involved in stem cell maintenance in the ""AHR high"" fraction. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate for the first time that down-regulation of AHR expression, a major cell cycle regulator, is involved in the myeloproliferative phenotype associated with CML. AHR agonists inhibit clonogenic and LTC-IC-derived progenitor growth and they could be used in leukemic stem cell targeting in CML.",,"['Gentil, Melanie', 'Hugues, Patricia', 'Desterke, Christophe', 'Telliam, Gladys', 'Sloma, Ivan', 'Souza, Lucas E B', 'Baykal, Seda', 'Artus, Jerome', 'Griscelli, Frank', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Johnson-Ansah, Hyacinthe', 'Foudi, Adlen', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli, Annelise', 'Turhan, Ali G']","['Gentil M', 'Hugues P', 'Desterke C', 'Telliam G', 'Sloma I', 'Souza LEB', 'Baykal S', 'Artus J', 'Griscelli F', 'Guerci A', 'Johnson-Ansah H', 'Foudi A', 'Bennaceur-Griscelli A', 'Turhan AG']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4254-7509', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8654-5332', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4861-0137']","['Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Le Kremlin Bicetre and Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Le Kremlin Bicetre and Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'Dokuz Eylul University Medical School, Medical Biology and Genetics Dept, Izmir, Turkey.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'CHU de Nancy, Nancy, France.', 'CHU Caen, Department of Hematology, Caen, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Le Kremlin Bicetre and Villejuif, France."", ""Institut Federatif d'Hematologie Paris Sud (IFHIPS), APHP and Service d'Hematologie Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France."", 'Inserm U935, Villejuif, France.', 'University Paris Sud, Faculty of Medicine, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Le Kremlin Bicetre and Villejuif, France."", ""Institut Federatif d'Hematologie Paris Sud (IFHIPS), APHP and Service d'Hematologie Bicetre and Paul Brousse, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180809,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole)', '0 (AHR protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon)', '0 (StemRegenin 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Carbazoles/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon/agonists/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",PMC6084853,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2018/08/10 06:00,2019/01/29 06:00,['2018/08/10 06:00'],"['2018/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0200923 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-03938 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Aug 9;13(8):e0200923. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0200923. eCollection 2018.,8,e0200923,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TX-induced cytotoxicity in APL cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of TX cytotoxicity using APL cell lines. We assessed TX toxicity by quantitatively measuring lactate dehydrogenase levels. Inhibition of cell cycle progression was assessed by confocal microscopy of Ki-67 expression. Apoptosis was evaluated by Western blot analysis of apoptotic proteins expression, immunocytochemistry, and confocal imaging of annexin V and propidium iodide. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade was analyzed by Western blot analysis and inhibitor-based experiments with APL cells. We found that TX-induced cytotoxicity inhibited APL cell cycle progression. TX also induced significant (P < 0.05) changes in the expression levels of apoptotic molecules and activated the phosphorylation of MAPK signaling pathways in APL cells.

In the noninterventional study PIAZA, we evaluated the effectiveness and safety of azacitidine treatment in 149 patients with higher-risk MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in routine clinical practice. METHOD: Patients were treated according to physician's discretion. Besides evaluation of safety and effectiveness, impact of covariates on progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed. RESULTS: Median age of patients was 75 years. 61.1% of patients were diagnosed with MDS, 31.5% with AML and 7.4% with CMML. Patients were treated with azacitidine for a median of seven cycles. Median PFS was 10.9 months. Median OS was 14.1 months. Two-year survival rate was 28.9%. 45.9% of patients showed CR or PR. Stable and progressive disease were observed in 37.2% and 8% of patients, respectively. Transfusion independence was reported in 64 of 89 patients. Eastern cooperative oncology group (ECOG) performance status (PS) and red blood cell (RBC) transfusion before azacitidine therapy were identified as predictive factors for PFS. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, we estimated the duration of PFS in a real-world setting and identified ECOG PS and RBC transfusion as predictive factors for PFS.

Inotuzumab ozogamicin was associated with significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS), duration of remission and higher haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) rates than standard therapy. Although there was no significant between-group difference in overall survival duration as per the study design, the 2-year survival probability in the inotuzumab ozogamicin arm was twice that in the control arm.

Linezolid resistance is increasingly identified in S. epidermidis, but whether such resistance alters the clinical course of S. epidermidis infections is unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical impact of linezolid resistance in leukemia patients with S. epidermidis bloodstream infection. Methods: This was a retrospective, single-center cohort study of all adult leukemia patients with S. epidermidis bacteremia treated with empiric linezolid between 2012 and 2015. The primary end point was adverse clinical outcome on day 3, defined as a composite of persistent bacteremia, fever, intensive care unit admission, or death. Fourteen- and 30-day mortality were also assessed. Results: Eighty-two unique leukemia patients with S. epidermidis were identified. Linezolid resistance was identified in 33/82 (40%). Patients with linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis were significantly more likely to have persistent bacteremia (41% vs 7%; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 5.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.63-16.30; P = .005); however, adverse short-term clinical outcomes overall were not more common among patients with linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis (61% vs 33%; aRR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.92-2.32; P = .108). No differences were observed in 14- or 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Leukemia patients with linezolid-resistant S. epidermidis bacteremia who were treated with linezolid were significantly more likely to have persistent bacteremia compared with those with linezolid-sensitive isolates.

Objective: The objective of this commentary is to propose a useful cost-effective disease-modifying treatment option for pwMS in LMIC with potential high efficacy and high convenience to the pwMS and treating physician.Viewpoint: We propose using generic 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (cladribine), a small molecule licensed for treatment of people with hairy cell leukaemia, as a solution of this significant equity imbalance. Cladribine has been shown in phase II and III trials to be a highly effective disease-modifying treatment for pwMS, and its adverse effect profile is comparable with any DMT currently licensed in high-income economies where an oral preparation has recently been licensed by the European Medicines Agency. Conclusion: Our viewpoint takes into account experience we have gathered over the past three years in the use of generic cladribine to treat pwMS.

To identify the key axis that regulates benzene-induced hematotoxicity or even leukemia, we investigated miR-146a expression in human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) during the differentiation process. By performing a colony formation assay and flow cytometry on cells in the differentiation process after hydroquinone treatment, we found that hydroquinone induced a marked reduction of differentiation toward myeloid cells and immune cells in CD34(+) cells (5 days exposure) as well as in HL-60 cells (3 h exposure). Further study using real-time PCR and western blot showed that the impaired myeloid differentiation was accompanied by the up-regulation of miR-146a and the down-regulation of TRAF6 and NF-kappaB. Using the miR-146a-5p inhibitor to suppress miR-146a expression could relieve the inhibitory effect on myeloid differentiation induced by hydroquinone to a certain extent. At the same time, the level of TRAF6 protein, as well as the phosphorylated IkappaBalpha protein which indicates NF-kappaB transcriptional activity was restored to the same levels as the control group. These results suggested that hydroquinone induced a dysregulation of miR-146a and its downstream NF-kappaB transcriptional factor pathway, which might be an early event in the generation of benzene-induced differentiation disturbance and subsequent leukemogenesis.",,"['Yuan, Weixin', 'Sun, Qing', 'Jiang, Yanping', 'Zhang, Xinjie', 'Chen, Liping', 'Xie, Chunjiao', 'Qin, Fei', 'Chen, Yuncong', 'Lv, Hongxin', 'Chen, Wen', 'Xiao, Yongmei']","['Yuan W', 'Sun Q', 'Jiang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Chen L', 'Xie C', 'Qin F', 'Chen Y', 'Lv H', 'Chen W', 'Xiao Y']",,"['Guangzhou Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution and Health Risk Assessment , School of Public Health , Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , China .

Gene expression profiling offers a promising approach in health hazard identification of chemicals. The aim of this study was to use gene expression profiling to identify the toxicities and potentially relevant human diseases due to endosulfan exposure. We performed DNA microarray analysis to analyze gene expression profiles in human endothelial cells exposed to 20, 40 and 60 muM endosulfan in combination with an endothelial phenotype. Microarray results showed that endosulfan increased the number of altered genes in a dose-dependent manner, and changed the expression of 161 genes across all treatment groups. qRT-PCR closely matched the microarray data for the genes tested. Significantly enriched biological processes for overlapping down-regulated genes include the neurological system process, signal transduction, and homeostatic process in all the dose groups. These down-regulated genes were associated with cytoskeleton organization and DNA repair at low doses, and involved in cell cycle, apoptosis, p53 pathway and carcinogenesis at high doses. Those up-regulated genes were linked to the inflammatory response and transcriptional misregulation in cancer at higher doses. These findings are consistent with our established endothelial phenotypes. Endosulfan may be relevant to human diseases including liver cancer, prostate cancer and leukemia using the NextBio Human Disease Atlas. These results provide molecular evidence supporting the toxicities and carcinogenic potential of endosulfan in humans.",,"['Xu, Dan', 'Li, Shuai', 'Lin, Limei', 'Qi, Fei', 'Hang, Xiaoming', 'Sun, Yeqing']","['Xu D', 'Li S', 'Lin L', 'Qi F', 'Hang X', 'Sun Y']",,"['Institute of Environmental Systems Biology , Dalian Maritime University , Linghai Road 1 , Dalian , 116026 , P.R.

Treatment failure and subsequent relapse have been attributed to acute myeloid leukemia-initiating cells (LSC), which harbor stem cell properties and are inherently chemoresistant. Although pediatric and adult AML represent two genetically very distinct diseases, we reasoned that common LSC gene expression programs are shared and consequently, the highly prognostic LSC17 signature score recently developed in adults may also be of clinical interest in childhood AML. Here, we demonstrated prognostic relevance of the LSC17 score in pediatric non-core-binding factor AML using Nanostring technology (ELAM02) and RNA-seq data from the NCI (TARGET-AML). AML were stratified by LSC17 quartile groups (lowest 25%, intermediate 50% and highest 25%) and children with low LSC17 score had significantly better event-free survival (EFS: HR = 3.35 (95%CI = 1.64-6.82), P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS: HR = 3.51 (95%CI = 1.38-8.92), P = 0.008) compared with patients with high LSC17 scores. More importantly, the high LSC17 score was an independent negative EFS and OS prognosticator determined by multivariate Cox model analysis (EFS: HR = 3.42 (95% CI = 1.63-7.16), P = 0.001; OS HR = 3.02 (95%CI = 1.16-7.85), P = 0.026).

While relapse occurs in approximately 30% of patients, few risk-modifying genetic variants have been identified. The present study evaluates the predictive potential of patient genetics on relapse risk in a genome-wide manner. We studied 151 graft recipients with HLA-matched sibling donors by sequencing the whole-exome, active immunoregulatory regions, and the full MHC region. To assess the predictive capability and contributions of SNPs and INDELs, we employed machine learning and a feature selection approach in a cross-validation framework to discover the most informative variants while controlling against overfitting. Our results show that germline genetic polymorphisms in patients entail a significant contribution to relapse risk, as judged by the predictive performance of the model (AUC = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.63-0.81]). Furthermore, the top contributing variants were predictive in two independent replication cohorts (n = 258 and n = 125) from the same population.

This resistance is related to the molecular genetic heterogeneity in MM cells as well as to the contributions from the BM, which is one of the key determinants of treatment outcome. Our previous studies using fluorescent tracers revealed that MM heterogeneity is correlated with the presence of quiescent stem-like cancer cells, which prefer to reside within the osteoblastic niche of the BM. In this report, we identified a novel protein, tripartite motif containing 44 (TRIM44), which is overexpressed in the osteoblastic niche of the BM, enabling MM cells to compete with HSCs for niche support. TRIM44 expression in MM cells promoted cell quiescence but increased bone destruction in xenograft mice, similar to what is observed in MM patients. TRIM44 functions as a deubiquitinase for hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha), which stabilizes HIF-1alpha expression during hypoxia and normoxia. Stabilized HIF-1alpha stimulates MM cell growth and survival during hypoxia. Our work is the first report to reveal signaling in quiescent MM cells and the functions of TRIM44.",,"['Chen, Zheng', 'Lin, Tsung-Chin', 'Bi, Xiaohong', 'Lu, Guijin', 'Dawson, Brian C', 'Miranda, Roberto', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'McNiece, Ian', 'McCarty, Nami']","['Chen Z', 'Lin TC', 'Bi X', 'Lu G', 'Dawson BC', 'Miranda R', 'Medeiros LJ', 'McNiece I', 'McCarty N']",,"['Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Disease, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Disease, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Precision Medicine, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Center for Stem Cell and Regenerative Disease, Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA. nami.mccarty@uth.tmc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180808,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (HIF1A protein, human)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (TRIM44 protein, human)', '0 (Tripartite Motif Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', '*Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism/*pathology', 'Protein Stability', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tripartite Motif Proteins', 'Ubiquitination', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6365383,,,,2018/08/10 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/09/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0222-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0222-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Feb;33(2):469-486. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0222-x.

As a key factor, the expression of SOX2 is tightly regulated at transcriptional and post-translational levels. However, the underlying mechanism of SOX2 protein stability remains to be elucidated. Here we show that the histone-lysine N-methyltransferase MLL1/WDR5 complexes physically interact with SOX2 and evoke SOX2 proteolysis, possibly through methylation on a potential site lysine 42 (K42). Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated gene silencing of the components of the MLL1/WDR5 complexes WDR5, MLL1, RBBP5, and ASH2L lead to the accumulation of SOX2, while forced expression of WDR5 promotes SOX2 ubiquitination and proteolysis. Conversely, PHD finger protein 20-like protein 1 (PHF20L1) associates with SOX2, antagonizes SOX2 ubiquitination and the sequential degradation induced by the MLL1/WDR5 complexes. RNA interferences of PHF20L1 promote the degradation of SOX2, while forced expression of PHF20L1 stabilizes SOX2. Co-silencing of MLL1/WDR5 components and PHF20L1 preclude degradation of SOX2 induced by knockdown of PHF20L1. Moreover, co-expression of PHF20L1 and WDR5 prevent ubiquitination of SOX2 triggered by WDR5 over-expression. However, SOX2 mutant K42R is non-sensitive to the MLL1/WDR5 complexes or PHF20L1. In addition, PHF20L1 may regulate the stability of SOX2 through its malignant brain tumor (MBT) domain, since the degradation of SOX2 is accelerated by UNC1215 and UNC669, inhibitors that bind to the MBT domain. Furthermore, abundant expression of SOX2 is highly correlated to immature ovarian teratoma. Loss of PHF20L1 weakened the tumor initiation ability of PA-1 cells while ablation of MLL1 promoted the growth of tumors. Thus, our studies reveal an antagonistic mechanism by which the protein stability of SOX2 is regulated by the MLL1/WDR5 complexes and PHF20L1, possibly through methylation of SOX2 protein, and provide a novel perspective on SOX2-positive cancer treatment.",,"['Wang, Qianqian', 'Yu, Min', 'Ma, Yue', 'Zhang, Xiaoming', 'Zhang, Hui', 'Li, Shuiming', 'Lan, Rongfeng', 'Lu, Fei']","['Wang Q', 'Yu M', 'Ma Y', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang H', 'Li S', 'Lan R', 'Lu F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5086-1157'],"['State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology & Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology & Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology & Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology & Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, NV, 89154, USA. hui.zhang@unlv.edu.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresource & Ecology, College of Life Science, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, China.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Medical Genetics, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, 518071, China. lan@szu.edu.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Key Laboratory of Chemical Genomics, School of Chemical Biology & Biotechnology, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, Shenzhen, 518055, China. lufei@pkusz.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180808,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (PHF20L1 protein, human)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', '0 (WDR5 protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/*metabolism', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Methylation', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability', 'Proteolysis', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Teratoma/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitination']",,,,,2018/08/10 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/08/10 06:00'],"['2017/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41374-018-0106-8 [doi]', '10.1038/s41374-018-0106-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2018 Dec;98(12):1627-1641. doi: 10.1038/s41374-018-0106-8.

Hence, it has been proposed that APN/CD13 inhibition can increase cellular ROS levels and sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic agents. Although ubenimex, also known as bestatin, competitively inhibits proteases such as APN/CD13 on the cellular membrane and it is clinically used for patients with acute myeloid leukemia and lymphedema, research has demonstrated that higher concentrations of the agent induce the death of APN/CD13(+) HCC stem cells. In this study, we developed a poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(lysine) block copolymer-ubenimex conjugate (PEG-b-PLys(Ube)) to increase the efficacy of reagents in APN/CD13(+) cancer stem cells. Exposure to PEG-b-PLys(Ube) increased the intracellular ROS concentration by inhibiting APN enzyme activity, permitting the induction of apoptosis and attenuation of HCC cell proliferation. In addition, PEG-b-PLys(Ube) exhibited a relatively stronger antitumor effect in mice than PEG-b-PLys alone or phosphate-buffered saline. Moreover, an isobologram analysis revealed that combinations of fluorouracil, cisplatin, or doxorubicin with PEG-b-PLys(Ube) exhibited synergistic effects. This study demonstrated that PEG-b-PLys(Ube) does not impair the properties of ubenimex and exerts a potent antitumor effect.",,"['Toshiyama, Reishi', 'Konno, Masamitsu', 'Eguchi, Hidetoshi',

All donors tested negative for HTLV-1. Only one HTLV-1 carrier did not present with ATL or HAM development after allo-HSCT. Among nine ATL cases after allo-HSCT, four eventually relapsed due to proliferation of recipient-derived ATL cells. However, in one ATL case, atypical HAM developed rapidly at 5 months after allo-HSCT.Among the 31 renal transplantation cases, all donors tested negative for HTLV-1, and only recipients tested positive. Only one HTLV-1 carrier recipient did not present with ATL or HAM development after renal transplantation. However, one HTLV-1-negative recipient developed PTLD in the brain 10 years after renal transplantation.In clinical practice, careful follow-up of HTLV-1 infected recipients after organ transplantation is important because atypical HAM can develop in ATL patients after allo-HSCT.

Our previous work has shown that these favorable outcomes are linked to the cytoplasmic relocalization and inactivation of FOXM1 driven by mutated NPM1. Here, we went on to confirm the important role of FOXM1 in increased chemoresistance in AML. A multiinstitution retrospective study was conducted to link FOXM1 expression to clinical outcomes in AML. We establish nuclear FOXM1 as an independent clinical predictor of chemotherapeutic resistance in intermediate-risk AML in a multivariate analysis incorporating standard clinicopathologic risk factors. Using colony assays, we show a dramatic decrease in colony size and numbers in AML cell lines with knockdown of FOXM1, suggesting an important role for FOXM1 in the clonogenic activity of AML cells. In order to further prove a potential role for FOXM1 in AML chemoresistance, we induced an FLT3-ITD-driven myeloid neoplasm in a FOXM1-overexpressing transgenic mouse model and demonstrated significantly higher residual disease after standard chemotherapy. This suggests that constitutive overexpression of FOXM1 in this model induces chemoresistance. Finally, we performed proof-of-principle experiments using a currently approved proteasome inhibitor, ixazomib, to target FOXM1 and demonstrated a therapeutic response in AML patient samples and animal models of AML that correlates with the suppression of FOXM1 and its transcriptional targets. Addition of low doses of ixazomib increases sensitization of AML cells to chemotherapy backbone drugs cytarabine and the hypomethylator 5-azacitidine. Our results underscore the importance of FOXM1 in AML progression and treatment, and they suggest that targeting it may have therapeutic benefit in combination with standard AML therapies.",,"['Khan, Irum', 'Halasi, Marianna', 'Patel, Anand', 'Schultz, Rachael', 'Kalakota, Nandini', 'Chen, Yi-Hua', 'Aardsma, Nathan', 'Liu, Li', 'Crispino, John D', 'Mahmud, Nadim', 'Frankfurt, Olga', 'Gartel, Andrei L']","['Khan I', 'Halasi M', 'Patel A', 'Schultz R', 'Kalakota N', 'Chen YH', 'Aardsma N', 'Liu L', 'Crispino JD', 'Mahmud N', 'Frankfurt O', 'Gartel AL']",,"['Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Illinois, Chicago, Illinois, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180809,United States,JCI Insight,JCI insight,101676073,"['0 (Boron Compounds)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '71050168A2 (ixazomib)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Boron Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glycine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Failure', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6129129,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Drug therapy', '*Hematology', '*Oncology']",,2018/08/10 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2018/08/10 06:00'],"['2018/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['121583 [pii]', '10.1172/jci.insight.121583 [doi]']",epublish,JCI Insight. 2018 Aug 9;3(15). pii: 121583. doi: 10.1172/jci.insight.121583. eCollection 2018 Aug 9.,15,,"['KL2 TR000107/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002002/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA194608/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, data suggest that antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) is the primary cytotoxic mechanism. We directly compared in vitro ADCP versus ADCC using primary human cells. After establishing the primacy of ADCP, we examined next-generation CD20 mAbs, including clinically relevant drug combinations for their effects on ADCP. ADCP and ADCC induction by rituximab, ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, or ocaratuzumab was measured using treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) target cells and either human monocyte-derived macrophages (for ADCP) or natural killer (NK) cells (for ADCC). Specific effects on ADCP were evaluated for clinically relevant drug combinations using BTK inhibitors (ibrutinib and acalabrutinib), PI3Kdelta inhibitors (idelalisib, ACP-319, and umbralisib), and the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. ADCP ( approximately 0.5-3 targets/macrophage) was >10-fold more cytotoxic than ADCC ( approximately 0.04-0.1 targets/NK cell). ADCC did not correlate with ADCP. Next-generation mAbs ocaratuzumab and ofatumumab induced ADCP at 10-fold lower concentrations than rituximab. Ofatumumab, selected for enhanced complement activation, significantly increased ADCP in the presence of complement. CD20 mAb-induced ADCP was not inhibited by venetoclax and was less inhibited by acalabrutinib versus ibrutinib and umbralisib versus idelalisib. Overall, ADCP was a better measure of clinically relevant mAb-induced cellular cytotoxicity, and next-generation mAbs could activate ADCP at significantly lower concentrations, suggesting the need to test a wide range of dose sizes and intervals to establish optimal therapeutic regimens. Complement activation by mAbs can contribute to ADCP, and venetoclax, acalabrutinib, and umbralisib are preferred candidates for multidrug therapeutic regimens. Cancer Immunol Res; 6(10); 1150-60.

In particular, anti-CD19 CAR T-cell therapy has effected impressive clinical responses in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, not all patients respond, and relapse with antigen loss has been observed in all patient subsets. Here, we report on the design and optimization of a novel CAR directed to the surface antigen CD37, which is expressed in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and in some cases of cutaneous and peripheral T-cell lymphomas. We found that CAR-37 T cells demonstrated antigen-specific activation, cytokine production, and cytotoxic activity in models of B- and T-cell lymphomas in vitro and in vivo, including patient-derived xenografts. Taken together, these results are the first showing that T cells expressing anti-CD37 CAR have substantial activity against 2 different lymphoid lineages, without evidence of significant T-cell fratricide. Furthermore, anti-CD37 CARs were readily combined with anti-CD19 CARs to generate dual-specific CAR T cells capable of recognizing CD19 and CD37 alone or in combination.

METHODS: The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and survival outcomes of patients with SPCs among POFT cancer survivors were analysed. RESULTS: Among 20,738 POFT cancer survivors, 798 (3.84%) developed SPCs, at an average interval of 5.50 years. SPC risk in POFT survivors (SIR, 1.29) was higher compared to the general population. The most high-risk type of SPC was leukaemia (3.07) followed by the lung and bronchus (1.80), colon (1.58), rectum and rectosigmoid junction (1.42), thyroid (1.34), and breast (1.26). In women aged < 60 years, cancer of the breast (1.30), ascending colon (2.26), and transverse colon (4.07) as SPCs increased. Up to 10 years after POFT cancer treatment, leukaemia risk increased, especially in those < 60 years, with serous histology, and with distant stage, which required aggressive chemotherapy. The median overall survival time was 12.8 years and 14.3 years in women with POFT cancer and SPCs, respectively. Thyroid and breast cancers were favourable prognostic markers among SPCs. CONCLUSIONS: The overall SPC risk increases in POFT cancer survivors, especially in those < 60 years.

In the course of the recent decade, there have been significant efforts in order to minimize multiple gestations, while improving percentages of singleton pregnancies and offering individualized services in IVF, in line with the trend of personalized medicine. Patients as well as clinicians and the entire IVF team benefit majorly from 'knowing what to expect' from an IVF cycle. Hereby, the question that has emerged is to what extent prognosis could facilitate toward the achievement of the above goal. In the current review, we present prediction models based on patients' characteristics and IVF data, as well as models based on embryo morphology and biomarkers during culture shaping a complication free and cost-effective personalized treatment. The starting point for the implementation of prediction models was initiated by the aspiration of moving toward optimal practice. Thus, prediction models could serve as useful tools that could safely set the expectations involved during this journey guiding and making IVF treatment more effective. The aim and scope of this review is to thoroughly present the evolution and contribution of prediction models toward an efficient IVF treatment.

Aim of this study was to evaluate impact of genetic variants in the key genes involved in ara-C metabolism on the leukemic cell intracellular levels of ara-CTP. METHOD: We investigated SNPs in 14 ara-C metabolic-pathway genes, for association with intracellular ara-CTP levels, in leukemic cells obtained post-initiation of cytarabine infusion in pediatric AML patients (n = 68). RESULTS: Nine SNPs were significantly associated with leukemic cell intracellular concentration of ara-CTP. A comprehensive ara-CTP-SNP-score (ACSS) was further developed from top four SNPs identified in regression model. Patients were classified into three groups based on ACSS: high-ACSS (score >0), intermediate-ACSS (score = 0) and low-ACSS (score <0). ACSS designation was significant predictor of intracellular ara-CTP levels (p = 0.00012), suggesting a cumulative or synergistic effect of the significant SNPs. CONCLUSION: ACSS score designation holds promise in definfing ara-C dose. Validation of the clinical utility of ACSS score in other independent cohorts will help identification of patients with potentially lower or higher levels of the ara-CTP in leukemic cells, thereby opening up opportunities for dose management to reduce toxicity and enhance efficacy.",,"['Elsayed, Abdelrahman H', 'Cao, Xueyuan', 'Crews, Kristine R', 'Gandhi, Varsha', 'Plunkett, William', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Lamba, Jatinder K']","['Elsayed AH', 'Cao X', 'Crews KR', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Pounds SB', 'Lamba JK']",,"['Department of Pharmacotherapy & Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Acute & Tertiary Care, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis 38163, TN, USA.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77054, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA."", 'Department of Pharmacotherapy & Translational Research, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180808,England,Pharmacogenomics,Pharmacogenomics,100897350,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '65-47-4 (Cytidine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'Cytidine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC6219441,['NOTNLM'],"['*SNPs', '*cytarabine', '*pharmacogenomics', '* acute myeloid leukemia']",,2018/08/09 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2018/08/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.2217/pgs-2018-0086 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenomics. 2018 Sep 1;19(14):1101-1110. doi: 10.2217/pgs-2018-0086.

Recently, we found that the piperidone compound P2 exhibits a potent anti-neoplastic activity against human breast cancer-derived cells. Here, we aimed to evaluate two piperidone compounds, P1 and P2, for their potential anti-neoplastic activity against human leukemia/lymphoma-derived cells. METHODS: Cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction were evaluated using MTS, annexin V-FITC/PI and mitochondrial membrane potential polychromatic assays to confirm the mode of action of the piperidone compounds. The effects of compound P1 and P2 treatment on gene expression were assessed using AmpliSeq analysis and, subsequently, confirmed by RT-qPCR and Western blotting. RESULTS: We found that the two related piperidone compounds P1 and P2 selectively killed the leukemia/lymphoma cells tested at nanomolar concentrations through induction of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, as demonstrated by mitochondrial depolarization and caspase-3 activation. AmpliSeq-based transcriptome analyses of the effects of compounds P1 and P2 on HL-60 acute leukemia cells revealed a differential expression of hundreds of genes, 358 of which were found to be affected by both. Additional pathway analyses revealed that a significant number of the common genes were related to the unfolded protein response, implying a possible role of the two compounds in the induction of proteotoxic stress. Subsequent analyses of the transcriptome data revealed that P1 and P2 induced similar gene expression alterations as other well-known proteasome inhibitors. Finally, we found that Noxa, an important mediator of the activity of proteasome inhibitors, was significantly upregulated at both the mRNA and protein levels, indicating a possible role in the cytotoxic mechanism induced by P1 and P2. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that the cytotoxic activity of P1 and P2 on leukemia/lymphoma cells is mediated by proteasome inhibition, leading to activation of pro-apoptotic pathways.",,"['Contreras, Lisett', 'Calderon, Ruben I', 'Varela-Ramirez, Armando', 'Zhang, Hong-Yu', 'Quan, Yuan', 'Das, Umashankar', 'Dimmock, Jonathan R', 'Skouta, Rachid', 'Aguilera, Renato J']","['Contreras L', 'Calderon RI', 'Varela-Ramirez A', 'Zhang HY', 'Quan Y', 'Das U', 'Dimmock JR', 'Skouta R', 'Aguilera RJ']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3765-2793'],"['Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Agricultural Bioinformatics, College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, People's Republic of China."", ""Hubei Key Laboratory of Agricultural Bioinformatics, College of Informatics, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, 430070, People's Republic of China."", 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, S7N 5E5, Canada.', 'Drug Discovery and Development Research Group, College of Pharmacy and Nutrition, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, S7N 5E5, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA.', 'Department of Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, 01003-9297, USA.', 'Department of Biological Sciences and Border Biomedical Research Center, The University of Texas at El Paso, 500 West University Avenue, El Paso, TX, 79968-0519, USA. raguilera@utep.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180807,Netherlands,Cell Oncol (Dordr),Cellular oncology (Dordrecht),101552938,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidones)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Ubiquitinated Proteins)', '120904-94-1 (Polyubiquitin)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Ontology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Piperidones/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Polyubiquitin/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitinated Proteins/metabolism', 'Unfolded Protein Response/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",PMC6241245,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-cancer drug discovery.

The simultaneous presence of thyroid carcinoma in the struma ovarii and the thyroid gland is extremely rare. It remains unclear if these carcinomas represent independent primary tumors and whether the molecular mechanisms of the tumors developing in the thyroid and ovarian tissues are similar. We present the case of a patient with two independent papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) in struma ovarii and the thyroid gland that are driven by different RAS mutations. A 62-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma was diagnosed with a pelvic mass during a CT scan. She had surgery that included removal of her ovaries. A 7.2-cm classical variant of PTC arising in a struma ovarii was identified in the right ovary. Two months after the pelvic surgery, total thyroidectomy was performed, and a small nodule (0.8 cm) in the left lobe was diagnosed as a classical variant of PTC. Molecular analysis of tissues obtained from both the malignant struma ovarii and thyroid gland was performed. RAS mutations both in the PTC located in the thyroid and ovarian tissues were identified. However, whereas the thyroid gland tumor showed an HRAS Q61R mutation, the PTC in struma ovarii harbored an NRAS Q61R mutation.

Its low aqueous solubility ( approximately 8.6 mug/mL) could be one of the reasons for achieving optimal in vivo efficacy relatively at a higher dose. Being a nitrogenous compound, salt formation was envisaged as one of the ideal approaches to enhance its solubility and dissolution profile. Thus, herein, a solubility-guided miniaturized 96-well plate salt screening protocol was devised for identification of the suitable salt form of this preclinical candidate. The solubility-guided strategy has resulted in the identification of hydrochloride as the most favorable counterion, resulting in 45-fold improvement in aqueous solubility. The HCl salt was then scaled up at a gram size and characterized using (1)H and (13)C NMR, scanning electron microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared, and differential scanning calorimetry studies. The HCl salt displayed enhancement in the in vitro dissolution profile as well as improved plasma exposure in the pharmacokinetic study. The oral administration of the IIIM-290.HCl salt in BALB/c mice resulted in >1.5-fold improvement in areas under the curve, Cmax, and half-life.

Therefore, we conducted a focused literature review to assess the role of hypomethylating agents in elderly patients with refractory AML. In addition, we present a case report of a patient with refractory AML, who was subsequently treated with azacytidine and showed an immediate response after one treatment cycle. He then proceeded to undergo nine more cycles. Ten months after the start of treatment with azacytidine, he remains in complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery.

HTLV-1 proteins, including Tax and HBZ, have been shown to have critical roles in HTLV-1 pathogenicity, yet the underlying mechanisms of HTLV-1-driven leukemogenesis are unclear. The frequent disruption of genetic and epigenetic gene regulation in various types of malignancy, including ATL, is evident. In this review, we illustrate a focused range of topics about the establishment of HTLV-1 memory: (1) genetic lesion in the Tax interactome pathway, (2) gene regulatory loop/switch, (3) disordered chromatin regulation, (4) epigenetic lock by the modulation of epigenetic factors, (5) the loss of gene fine-tuner microRNA, and (6) the alteration of chromatin regulation by HTLV-1 integration. We discuss the persistent influence of Tax-dependent epigenetic changes even after the disappearance of HTLV-1 gene expression due to the viral escape from the immune system, which is a remaining challenge in HTLV-1 research.

The molecules are formed by a backsplicing event linking the 3'-end of an exon to the 5'-end of the same or an upstream exon, and they exert diverse regulatory functions important in carcinogenesis. The landscape of circRNA expression has not been characterized in B-cell malignancies, and current methods for circRNA quantification have several limitations that prevent development of clinically applicable assays. Here, we demonstrate that circRNAs can be accurately quantified without enzymatic reactions or bias using color-coded probes (NanoString technology). First, we performed high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of several mantle cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma cell lines to profile the genome-wide landscape of circRNA expression. We detected several circRNAs known to be deregulated in other cancers and identified a novel circRNA from the IKZF3 gene. Based on these data, we selected 52 unique circRNAs for which we designed color-coded probes spanning their specific backsplicing junctions. These circRNAs were quantified in cell lines and patient samples from several different B-cell malignancies (mantle cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma, follicular lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia) simultaneously using the NanoString technology. The circRNA expression profiles obtained could distinguish different B-cell malignancies, and confirmed the presence of the novel circRNA derived from IKZF3. The NanoString assays were specific for circRNA detection and data were more reproducible and quantitatively more accurate than RNA-seq data. In addition, we obtained high-quality data on severely degraded RNA samples from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Together, we provide a map of circRNA expression in B-cell malignancies and present an enzyme-free digital counting methodology, which has the potential to become a new gold standard for circRNA quantification.",,"['Dahl, Mette', 'Daugaard, Iben', 'Andersen, Maria Schertz', 'Hansen, Thomas Birkballe', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten', 'Kjems, Jorgen', 'Kristensen, Lasse Sommer']","['Dahl M', 'Daugaard I', 'Andersen MS', 'Hansen TB', 'Gronbaek K', 'Kjems J', 'Kristensen LS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5980-7939'],"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, BRIC, Copenhagen University, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre, BRIC, Copenhagen University, DK-2100, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics (MBG), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark. lasse@mbg.au.dk.', 'Interdisciplinary Nanoscience Center (iNANO), Aarhus University, DK-8000, Aarhus, Denmark. lasse@mbg.au.dk.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180807,United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (RNA, Circular)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)']",IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Circular', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA']",PMC6265260,,,,2018/08/09 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/08/09 06:00'],"['2018/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41374-018-0108-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41374-018-0108-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 2018 Dec;98(12):1657-1669. doi: 10.1038/s41374-018-0108-6.

The efficacy of these drugs, however, is mitigated by the outgrowth of resistant cells, most often driven by a secondary acquired mutation in EGFR, T790M We recently demonstrated that T790M can arise de novo during treatment; it follows that one potential therapeutic strategy to thwart resistance would be identifying and eliminating these cells [referred to as drug-tolerant cells (DTC)] prior to acquiring secondary mutations like T790M Experimental Design: We have developed DTCs to EGFRi in EGFR-mutant lung cancer cell lines. Subsequent analyses of DTCs included RNA-seq, high-content microscopy, and protein translational assays. Based on these results, we tested the ability of MCL-1 BH3 mimetics to combine with EGFR inhibitors to eliminate DTCs and shrink EGFR-mutant lung cancer tumors in vivo Results: We demonstrate surviving EGFR-mutant lung cancer cells upregulate the antiapoptotic protein MCL-1 in response to short-term EGFRi treatment. Mechanistically, DTCs undergo a protein biosynthesis enrichment resulting in increased mTORC1-mediated mRNA translation of MCL-1, revealing a novel mechanism in which lung cancer cells adapt to short-term pressures of apoptosis-inducing kinase inhibitors. Moreover, MCL-1 is a key molecule governing the emergence of early EGFR-mutant DTCs to EGFRi, and we demonstrate it can be effectively cotargeted with clinically emerging MCL-1 inhibitors both in vitro and in vivo Conclusions: Altogether, these data reveal that this novel therapeutic combination may delay the acquisition of secondary mutations, therefore prolonging therapy efficacy.

METHODS: Fifty-three cases were reviewed from Peking University People's Hospital from 2002 to 2017. According to WHO classification of tumours of haematopoietic and lymphoid tissues (2008) and classification updated (2016), the cases were studied by microscopy, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, combined with the bone marrow biopsy and clinical examination. RESULTS: In 53 cases, the male to female ratio was 3.4:1, the mean age was 55.4 years old, the median survival time was 17.0 months, and all patients present with variable degree of splenomegaly. The elevated percentage of lymphocyte in peripheral blood can be seen in 22 cases, and elevated LDH level in 24 cases. Abnormal blood counts can be seen in 26 cases before operation, and 22 cases remission to normal level partly or completely after operation. The clinical symptoms included abdominal pain or distension, fatigue, fever, and weight loss, etc. Seventeen cases present with lymphoadenopathy of abdomen or other sites. Fourteen cases were stage I or II, whereas 6 were stage III, 28 were stage IV. Forty-three cases were splenic B-cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)(48.8%,21/43), DLBCL(23.3%,10/43), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPSBL)(11.6%,5/43), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(9.3%,4/43), follicular lymphoma (FL)(4.7%,2/43), composite lymphoma (CL, DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma)(2.3%,1/43) in turn, and the remaining 10 cases were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (n=4), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) (n=1), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) (n=5). The survival period of SMZL and DLBCL was 25.7, 18.6 months, respectively. Thirteen cases were dead (27.1%, 13/48). The chemotherapy protocol included Hyper-CVAD A/B with/without R (Rituximab), COP, CHOP with/without R etc. The prognosis of those with elevated LDH level, high clinical staging, B symptom, and older than 60year old was obviously worse, and the prognosis of DLBCL was worse than that of SMZL. CONCLUSIONS: Most splenic lymphoid tumors present with splenomegaly and abnormal blood counts, and complete or part remission of blood counts can be seen after splenectomy, and splenectomy is also helpful for pathological diagnosis. The most common pathological types are SMZL and DLBCL. The definite diagnosis can be made by combining with clinical features, histopathology, immunophenotype, genetics, bone marrow biopsy and laboratory examination.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

To characterize the overall benefit-risk profile in 3L CP-CML patients treated with bosutinib vs. ponatinib, a matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC) was performed to compare efficacy outcomes and treatment duration after adjusting for trial subjects' baseline characteristics, and tolerability was assessed with an unadjusted comparison of study-drug discontinuation. METHODS: The MAIC was performed using published data from the pivotal bosutinib trial and the most recent individual-patient-level data on file from the pivotal ponatinib trial. RESULTS: Responses were more frequent and durable with ponatinib (n = 70 MAIC-adjusted) than with bosutinib (n = 119) - complete cytogenetic response (CCyR): 61% vs. 26%; Kaplan-Meier estimate of maintaining CCyR at 4 years: 89% vs. 54%. Median treatment duration was longer with ponatinib than with bosutinib: 38.4 vs. 8.6 months. Only 9% of ponatinib patients (n = 97 unadjusted) vs. 42% of bosutinib patients discontinued due to death, disease progression or unsatisfactory response; 19% vs. 24% discontinued due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these surrogate measures of patient benefit-risk profiles, ponatinib appears to provide a net overall benefit vs. bosutinib in 3L CP-CML.",,"['Levy, Moshe Yair', 'McGarry, Lisa J', 'Huang, Hui', 'Lustgarten, Stephanie', 'Chiroli, Silvia', 'Iannazzo, Sergio']","['Levy MY', 'McGarry LJ', 'Huang H', 'Lustgarten S', 'Chiroli S', 'Iannazzo S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-3226-5954'],"['a Baylor University Medical Center , Dallas , TX , USA.', 'b Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'c Currently affiliated with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Boston , MA , USA.', 'b Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'b Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited , Cambridge , MA , USA.', 'd Incyte Biosciences International Sarl , Epalinges , Switzerland.', 'e Currently affiliated with Prothena Switzerland GmbH , Zug , Switzerland.', 'f SIHS Health Economics Consulting , Torino , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180824,England,Curr Med Res Opin,Current medical research and opinion,0351014,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '0 (Quinolines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', '5018V4AEZ0 (bosutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aniline Compounds/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridazines/*therapeutic use', 'Quinolines/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Indirect comparison', '*bosutinib', '*chronic myelogenous leukemia', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*ponatinib', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,2018/08/09 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2018/08/09 06:00'],"['2018/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/03007995.2018.1510225 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Med Res Opin. 2019 Mar;35(3):479-487. doi: 10.1080/03007995.2018.1510225.

However, severe cardiovascular toxicity limits the clinical applications of dasatinib. Since the underlying mechanism of dasatinib-induced cardiotoxicity is still elusive, we aim to clarify this. Recent studies have shown that necroptosis and apoptosis participate in multiple toxicity development. Here, we first report that dasatinib could directly induce cardiomyocytes death, as analyzed by the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay. This type of cardiomyocytes death was mediated by the necrosis pathway rather than apoptosis, as determined by using flow cytometry to characterize the mode of dasatinib-induced cell death. Inhibition of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIP1)activity and knockdown of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3)expression can block dasatinib-evoked cardiotoxicity, which further confirmed the involvement of necroptosis. We next found that the classic substrates of RIP3, mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (MLKL) and Ca(2+)-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) were not involved in dasatinib-induced cardiomyocytes necroptosis. What's more, unlike the inflammation-associated necroptosis, dasatinib-triggered necroptosis was dependent on intracellular instead of secreted High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein. Collectively, our study revealed that dasatinib-induced cardiotoxicity acted via leading cardiomyocytes to HMGB1-mediated necroptosis, indicating a viable strategy for prevention of dasatinib-induced cardiotoxicity.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

30085557,,Publisher,,,,,2022 Jan,Evans Syndrome,,"Evans syndrome is an autoimmune condition that presents with two or more cytopenias, which commonly includes autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with or without immune neutropenia (only in 15% of cases, according to a report) [1]. The type of AIHA that presents in Evans syndrome is warm AIHA, in which IgG antibodies react with red blood cell (RBC) surface antigens at body temperature, as opposed to cold AIHA. In ITP, the immune system is directed against GPIIb/IIIa on the platelets. Recently, a proposition has been laid out to classify the condition as primary (idiopathic) or secondary (associated with an underlying disorder) [1]. Secondary Evans syndrome has been associated with diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), and autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) in [2] Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in patients older than 50 years, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), viral infections (such as HIV, hepatitis C) and following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Identifying Evans syndrome as secondary when associated with a disease is important because cytopenias have been observed to be more severe when with Evans syndrome in contrast to when presenting alone as AIHA or ITP. Also, the treatment options differ according to the classification.","['Copyright (c) 2022, StatPearls Publishing LLC.']","['Shaikh, Hira', 'Mewawalla, Prerna']","['Shaikh H', 'Mewawalla P']",,,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",,Treasure Island (FL),,,,,,,,,,,2018/08/08 06:01,2018/08/08 06:01,,,['NBK519015 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20180808,['20210725'],['StatPearls Publishing'],['StatPearls'],['2018/08/08 06:01']

The guidelines were extended to provide recommendations for other haematological diseases besides AML and recipients of an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Posaconazole remains the drug of choice when the incidence of invasive mould diseases exceeds 8%. For patients undergoing remission-induction chemotherapy for AML and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), fluconazole can still offer an alternative provided it forms part of an integrated care strategy that includes screening with biomarkers and imaging. Similarly, aerosolized liposomal amphotericin B combined with fluconazole can be considered for patients at high risk of invasive mould diseases but other formulations of the polyene are discouraged. Fluconazole is still recommended as primary prophylaxis for patients at low risk of invasive mould diseases during the pre-engraftment phase of allogeneic HSCT whereas only a moderate recommendation could be made for itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole for patients at high risk. Posaconazole is strongly recommended for preventing invasive mould disease post-engraftment but only when graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was accompanied by other risk factors such as its severity, use of an alternative donor or when unresponsive to standard corticosteroid therapy. The need for primary prophylaxis for other patient groups was less clear and should be defined by the estimated risk of invasive fungal disease (IFD).",,"['Maertens, Johan A', 'Girmenia, Corrado',

Endometrial epithelial area was significantly increased in mice treated with BMDCs, CXCL12, or by co-treatment with both compared with PBS-treated controls. Ki-67 and CD31 immunoreactivity was significantly higher in mice treated with either BMDCs, CXCL12, or both. The mRNA expression levels of endometrial receptivity markers leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin-1beta, and integrin beta-3 were increased in mice treated with either BMDCs, CXCL12, or both. The mRNA levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 were significantly decreased by BMDCs but not by CXCL12. Pregnancy rates and litter size were increased after either treatment. Both BMDCs and CXCL12 displayed a comparable efficacy on endometrial regeneration in mice with thin endometrium.

The disease is incurable with a cycling of treatment and relapse common. Little is known about the psychological and physical functioning of patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Cancer-specific stress is an important individual difference variable that predicts psychological and physical outcomes. Purpose: To examine cancer-specific stress at treatment initiation as a predictor of psychological and physical functioning trajectories in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia during the first 5 months of treatment. Methods: Patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (N = 152) enrolled in a phase II clinical trial completed self-report measures at treatment initiation (baseline), 1, 2, and 5 months of treatment. Cancer-specific stress at baseline was examined as a predictor of psychological (cognitive-affective depressive symptoms, negative mood, mental health quality of life) and physical functioning (fatigue interference, sleep problems, physical health quality of life), controlling for demographic and treatment variables. Results: Using multilevel modeling, higher baseline cancer-specific stress was related to worse psychological (cognitive-affective depressive symptoms, negative mood, mental health quality of life) and physical functioning (fatigue interference, sleep problems) at baseline and more rapid improvements during the next 5 months. Despite these improvements, higher baseline cancer-specific stress remained associated with poorer 5-month psychological, though not physical, functioning. Conclusions: Findings suggest cancer-specific stress at treatment initiation may be a risk factor for poorer psychological functioning during treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",,"['Goyal, Neha G', 'Maddocks, Kami J', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C', 'Westbrook, Travis D', 'Andersen, Barbara L']","['Goyal NG', 'Maddocks KJ', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC', 'Westbrook TD', 'Andersen BL']",,"['Department of Social Sciences and Health Policy, Wake Forest School of Medicine, Medical Center Boulevard, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University Medical Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Ann Behav Med,Annals of behavioral medicine : a publication of the Society of Behavioral Medicine,8510246,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Depression/etiology/physiopathology/psychology', '*Fatigue/etiology/physiopathology/psychology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life/*psychology', 'Recurrence', '*Sleep Wake Disorders/etiology/physiopathology/psychology', '*Stress, Psychological/etiology/physiopathology/psychology']",PMC6408323,,,,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['4847812 [pii]', '10.1093/abm/kax004 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Behav Med. 2018 Mar 15;52(4):287-298. doi: 10.1093/abm/kax004.,4,287-298,"['K05 CA098133/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA177292/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA122061/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['NIHMS965809'],,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified an imprinted region on chromosome 14, the DLK1-MEG3 locus, as being downregulated in islets from humans with T2DM. In this study, using targeted epigenetic modifiers, we prove that increased methylation at the promoter of Meg3 in mouse betaTC6 beta-cells results in decreased transcription of the maternal transcripts associated with this locus. As a result, the sensitivity of beta-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress was increased. Additionally, we demonstrate that an evolutionarily conserved intronic region at the MEG3 locus can function as an enhancer in betaTC6 beta-cells. Using circular chromosome conformation capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, we demonstrate that the promoter of MEG3 physically interacts with this novel enhancer and other putative regulatory elements in this imprinted region in human islets. Remarkably, this enhancer is bound in an allele-specific manner by the transcription factors FOXA2, PDX1, and NKX2.2. Overall, these data suggest that the intronic MEG3 enhancer plays an important role in the regulation of allele-specific expression at the imprinted DLK1-MEG3 locus in human beta-cells, which in turn impacts the sensitivity of beta-cells to cytokine-mediated oxidative stress.",['(c) 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.'],"['Kameswaran, Vasumathi', 'Golson, Maria L', 'Ramos-Rodriguez, Mireia', 'Ou, Kristy', 'Wang, Yue J', 'Zhang, Jia', 'Pasquali, Lorenzo', 'Kaestner, Klaus H']","['Kameswaran V', 'Golson ML', 'Ramos-Rodriguez M', 'Ou K', 'Wang YJ', 'Zhang J', 'Pasquali L', 'Kaestner KH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1228-021X'],"['Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Department of Endocrinology, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital and Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabolicas Asociadas, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Program of Predictive and Personalized Medicine of Cancer, Department of Endocrinology, Germans Trias i Pujol University Hospital and Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute, Badalona, Spain.', 'CIBER de Diabetes y Enfermedades Metabolicas Asociadas, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics and Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA kaestner@pennmedicine.upenn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180703,United States,Diabetes,Diabetes,0372763,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DLK1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (MEG3 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NKX2-2 protein, human)', '0 (Nkx2-2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tgif1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferase 1/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*metabolism/pathology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Loci', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Homeobox Protein Nkx-2.2', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Islets of Langerhans/*metabolism/pathology', 'Locus Control Region', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Tissue Banks', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6110314,,,,2018/08/08 06:00,2018/09/05 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['db17-0682 [pii]', '10.2337/db17-0682 [doi]']",ppublish,Diabetes. 2018 Sep;67(9):1807-1815. doi: 10.2337/db17-0682.

Historically, these antibodies were typically combined with chemotherapeutic agents. At present, therapeutic outcomes are significantly improving with the introduction of several novel targeted drugs to the clinical repertoire. AREAS COVERED: In this review, we summarize the current clinical standard together with the latest developments in the field of anti-CD20 antibodies against CLL. In addition, novel promising drugs against CLL are discussed, as well as their potential for combination with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. EXPERT OPINION: At present, there are three different anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies approved for the treatment of CLL with diverse effector mechanisms. These antibodies provide a robust foundation for combination therapy with novel molecules. Current research should be focused on reducing toxicity and reaching long-lasting remissions. There is still much to gain regarding the optimization of treatment combinations and dosing schedules for CLL. Overcoming the limitations of currently used anti-CD20 antibodies will be critical to further improve the efficacy of CLL therapy.",,"['Evers, Mitchell', 'Jak, Margot', 'Leusen, J H W']","['Evers M', 'Jak M', 'Leusen JHW']",,"['a Laboratory of Translational Immunology , UMC Utrecht , Utrecht , the Netherlands.', 'b Department of Hematology , UMC Utrecht , Utrecht , the Netherlands.', 'a Laboratory of Translational Immunology , UMC Utrecht , Utrecht , the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180810,England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD20/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Rituximab/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD20', '*CLL', '*antibody', '*combination therapy', '*leukemia']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/03/14 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/14712598.2018.1508444 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2018 Sep;18(9):973-982. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2018.1508444.

Here we show that 147-dependent ATF6 activation requires metabolic oxidation to form an electrophile that preferentially reacts with ER proteins. Proteins covalently modified by 147 include protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), known to regulate ATF6 activation. Genetic depletion of PDIs perturbs 147-dependent induction of the ATF6-target gene, BiP, implicating covalent modifications of PDIs in the preferential activation of ATF6 afforded by treatment with 147. Thus, 147 is a pro-drug that preferentially activates ATF6 signaling through a mechanism involving localized metabolic activation and selective covalent modification of ER resident proteins that regulate ATF6 activity.","['(c) 2018, Paxman et al.']","['Paxman, Ryan', 'Plate, Lars', 'Blackwood, Erik A', 'Glembotski, Chris', 'Powers, Evan T', 'Wiseman, R Luke', 'Kelly, Jeffery W']","['Paxman R', 'Plate L', 'Blackwood EA', 'Glembotski C', 'Powers ET', 'Wiseman RL', 'Kelly JW']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6421-1892', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4363-6116', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8185-8487', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9287-6840', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8943-3395']","['Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', 'San Diego State University Heart Institute, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', 'Department of Biology, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', 'San Diego State University Heart Institute, San Diego State University, San Diego, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.', 'The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180807,England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (ATF6 protein, human)', '0 (Activating Transcription Factor 6)', '0 (Amides)', '0 (Phenylpropionates)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factor 6/*genetics', 'Amides/*pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/drug effects/genetics', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*drug effects', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phenylpropionates/*pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Small Molecule Libraries/*pharmacology', 'Unfolded Protein Response/genetics']",PMC6080950,['NOTNLM'],"['*biochemistry', '*chemical biology', '*cytochrome p450', '*human', '*protein disulfide isomerase', '*proteostasis', '*proteostasis regulator', '*quinone methide', '*reactive cysteine']","['RP has submitted a patent application (WO2017117430A1) for the use of 147 and', 'other compounds as ER proteostasis network regulators to treat protein misfolding', 'diseases.

Despite recent discoveries of targeted therapies, the frontline therapy consisting of chemotherapy remains unchanged for the past four decades. Like other cancers, AML is characterized by deranged DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. Although impaired DDR may contribute to the pathogenesis of AML it also allows leukemia cells with damaged DNA to attempt repair resulting in resistance. CHK1 inhibitors reverse the cell cycle arrest, disallowing the cell to repair the chemotherapy-induced DNA damage, driving the cell to enter into mitotic catastrophe.Areas covered: This paper reviews the preclinical and clinical development of CHK1 inhibitors and we discussed their promising role as a potential addition to the therapeutic arsenal of AML.Expert opinion: Targeting the cell cycle checkpoints is an intriguing approach to treat cancer in general and AML in particular. CHK1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy have the potential of improving outcome in high-risk AML characterized by DDR activation.",,"['Chamoun, Kamal', 'Borthakur, Gautam']","['Chamoun K', 'Borthakur G']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7679-6453'],"['Leukemia Department, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Leukemia Department, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180807,England,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,9434197,,IM,,,['NOTNLM'],"['CHK1 inhibitor', 'DNA damage repair pathway', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'cell cycle inhibitors']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2018/08/08 06:01,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:01 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13543784.2018.1508448 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2018 Aug;27(8):661-666. doi: 10.1080/13543784.2018.1508448.

To date, we do not know to what extent functional health status contributes to psychological risk and which domains are most important. The aim of this study was to systematically explore which functional domain could explain anxiety, depression, and distress symptoms. PROCEDURE: We used data available for 105 adolescents and 182 adults successfully treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia at two Canadian sites part of the PETALE cohort. Participants were >/=5 years postdiagnosis, aged 22 +/- 6 years, 52% female, and 49% acute lymphoblastic leukemia high-risk status. The contribution of health functional status (15D/16D questionnaires) to self-reported anxiety, depression, and distress (Beck scales and distress thermometer) was evaluated using adjusted logistic regression models. RESULTS: Prevalence rates found for mild-severe anxiety, depression, and distress were 14%, 21%, and 30% among adolescents and 27%, 20%, and 19% among adults. Frequent health domains associated with psychological risk were sleeping and breathing in adolescents, and vitality/fatigue, discomfort/symptoms, mental function, and sleeping in adults. Mental function was systematically associated with psychological risk across age groups (median OR = 10.00, 95% CI 3.01-33.71). Exploratory mediation bootstrapping analyses suggested that the effect on psychological risk of overall health status and mental function problems was partly explained by social/work/school functioning. CONCLUSION: The results identified important functional health domains that could be targeted for interventions preventing psychological risk: vitality/fatigue, discomfort/symptoms, sleeping, and mental function issues. Health domains probably affect mood partly by limiting social/work/school functioning.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Anestin, Annelie S', 'Lippe, Sarah', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Michon, Bruno', 'Rondeau, Emelie', 'Samoilenko, Mariia', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Sultan, Serge']","['Anestin AS', 'Lippe S', 'Robaey P', 'Bertout L', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Michon B', 'Rondeau E', 'Samoilenko M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Sultan S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7520-1734'],"['Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Quebec University Health Center (QUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Universite du Quebec a Montreal (UQAM), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180807,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety/epidemiology/etiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Depression/epidemiology/etiology', 'Female', '*Health Status', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prevalence', 'Stress, Psychological/epidemiology/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood cancer', '*health status', '*late effects', '*psychological risk', '*survivorship']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27356 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Nov;65(11):e27356. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27356.

Unfortunately, vindoline, a main alkaloid component of Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don, itself, has no antitumor activity. In our novel research program, we have prepared and identified new vindoline derivatives with moderate cytostatic activity. Here, we describe the effect of conjugation of vindoline derivative with oligoarginine (tetra-, hexa-, or octapeptides) cell-penetrating peptides on the cytostatic activity in vitro and in vivo. Br-Vindoline-(l)-Trp-OH attached to the N-terminus of octaarginine was the most effective compound in vitro on HL-60 cell line. Analysis of the in vitro activity of two isomer conjugates (Br-vindoline-(l)-Trp-Arg8 and Br-vindoline-(d)-Trp-Arg8 suggests the covalent attachment of the vindoline derivatives to octaarginine increased the antitumor activity significantly against P388 and C26 tumour cells in vitro. The cytostatic effect was dependent on the presence and configuration of Trp in the conjugate as well as on the cell line studied. The configuration of Trp notably influenced the activity on C26 and P388 cells: conjugate with (l)-Trp was more active than conjugate with the (d)-isomer. In contrast, conjugates had very similar effect on both the HL-60 and MDA-MB-231 cells. In preliminary experiments, conjugate Br-vindoline-(l)-Trp-Arg8 exhibited some inhibitory effect on the tumor growth in P388 mouse leukemia tumor-bearing mice. Our results indicate that the conjugation of modified vindoline could result in an effective compound even with in vivo antitumor activity.","['(c) 2018 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']","['Banoczi, Zoltan', 'Keglevich, Andras', 'Szabo, Ildiko', 'Randelovic, Ivan', 'Hegedus, Zita', 'Regenbach, Fruzsina L', 'Keglevich, Peter', 'Lengyel, Zsofia', 'Gorka-Kereskenyi, Almos', 'Dubrovay, Zsofia', 'Hada, Viktor', 'Szigetvari, Aron', 'Szantay, Csaba Jr', 'Hazai, Laszlo', 'Tovari, Jozsef', 'Hudecz, Ferenc']","['Banoczi Z', 'Keglevich A', 'Szabo I', 'Randelovic I', 'Hegedus Z', 'Regenbach FL', 'Keglevich P', 'Lengyel Z', 'Gorka-Kereskenyi A', 'Dubrovay Z', 'Hada V', 'Szigetvari A', 'Szantay C Jr', 'Hazai L', 'Tovari J', 'Hudecz F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1880-4042'],"['Department of Organic Chemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111, Budapest, Gellert ter 4, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Experimental Pharmacology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Experimental Pharmacology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111, Budapest, Gellert ter 4, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111, Budapest, Gellert ter 4, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111, Budapest, Gellert ter 4, Hungary.', 'Spectroscopic Research Department, Gedeon Richter Plc, 10, PO Box 27, H-1475, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Spectroscopic Research Department, Gedeon Richter Plc, 10, PO Box 27, H-1475, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Spectroscopic Research Department, Gedeon Richter Plc, 10, PO Box 27, H-1475, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Spectroscopic Research Department, Gedeon Richter Plc, 10, PO Box 27, H-1475, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry and Technology, University of Technology and Economics, H-1111, Budapest, Gellert ter 4, Hungary.', 'Department of Experimental Pharmacology, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Organic Chemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-ELTE Research Group of Peptide Chemistry, Eotvos Lorand University, Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180806,England,J Pept Sci,Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,9506309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (octaarginine)', '571PJ1LW03 (vindoline)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/*chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oligopeptides/*chemistry', 'Vinblastine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Vinca alkaloids', 'antitumor activity', 'cell-penetrating peptide', 'peptide-conjugates', 'vindoline']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2018/11/27 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/psc.3118 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pept Sci. 2018 Oct;24(10):e3118. doi: 10.1002/psc.3118.

Little research has been performed to identify whether specific bacterial groups are associated with small cell GI lymphoma (LSA). HYPOTHESIS: Mucosal bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacterium spp., are abundant in intestinal biopsies of cats with small cell GI LSA compared to cats with IBD. ANIMALS: Fourteen cats with IBD and 14 cats with small cell GI LSA. METHODS: Retrospective case control study. A search of the medical records was performed to identify cats diagnosed with IBD and with GI LSA. Bacterial groups identified by FISH in GI biopsies were compared between cohorts and correlated to CD11b(+) and NF-kappaB expression. RESULTS: Fusobacterium spp. (median; IQR bacteria/region) were higher in cats with small cell GI LSA in ileal (527; 455.5 - 661.5; P = .046) and colonic (404.5; 328.8 - 455.5; P = .016) adherent mucus, and combined colonic compartments (free mucus, adherent mucus, attaching to epithelium) (8; 0 - 336; P = .017) compared to cats with IBD (ileum: 67; 31.5 - 259; colon: 142.5; 82.3 - 434.5; combined: 3; 0 - 34). Bacteroides spp. were higher in ileal adherent mucus (P = .036) and 3 combined ileal compartments (P = .034) of cats with small cell GI LSA. There were significant correlations between Fusobacterium spp. totals and CD11b(+) cell (P = .009; rs .476) and NF-kappaB expression (P = .004; rs .523). CONCLUSIONS: The bacterial alterations appreciated might be influential in development of small cell GI LSA, and should drive further studies to elucidate the effects of microbial-mediated inflammation on GI cancer progression.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

This study analyzed clinical responses and adverse effects of the use of 2G-TKIs following imatinib in pediatric chronic phase (CP)-CML. PROCEDURES: The Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group conducted a retrospective study of patients with newly diagnosed CML from 1996 to 2011. A total of 152 cases that received imatinib as first-line therapy were analyzed. RESULTS: Excluding 46 cases treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation before nilotinib and dasatinib became available, 31 of 106 patients changed to 2G-TKIs. The primary reason for changing from imatinib was poor response, followed by intolerance, with the main reason for the latter being musculoskeletal events. Switches from imatinib to 2G-TKIs with intolerance occurred significantly earlier than switches with poor response. Sixteen and 15 patients were treated with nilotinib and dasatinib, respectively, following imatinib therapy. After switching to 2G-TKIs, the response status improved in 63% of evaluable patients. The adverse effect profiles of nilotinib and dasatinib tended to be different, with hyperbilirubinemia observed in 33% of nilotinib-treated patients, but in none of the cases with dasatinib. CONCLUSION: This retrospective study represents the first series of children and adolescents in whom sequential use of imatinib followed by 2G-TKIs was reported. These data provide useful insights into the selection of 2G-TKIs as first-line treatment for children and adolescents with CP-CML.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Kurosawa, Hidemitsu', 'Tanizawa, Akihiko', 'Muramatsu, Hideki', 'Tono, Chikako', 'Watanabe, Akihiro', 'Shima, Haruko', 'Ito, Masaki', 'Yuza, Yuki', 'Hamamoto, Kazuko', 'Hotta, Noriko', 'Okada, Masahiko', 'Saito, Akiko Moriya', 'Manabe, Atsushi', 'Mizutani, Shuki', 'Adachi, Souichi', 'Horibe, Keizo', 'Ishii, Eiichi', 'Shimada, Hiroyuki']","['Kurosawa H', 'Tanizawa A', 'Muramatsu H', 'Tono C', 'Watanabe A', 'Shima H', 'Ito M', 'Yuza Y', 'Hamamoto K', 'Hotta N', 'Okada M', 'Saito AM', 'Manabe A', 'Mizutani S', 'Adachi S', 'Horibe K', 'Ishii E', 'Shimada H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0990-2508', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3432-8832']","['Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Human Resource Development for Cancer, Faculty of Medical Sciences, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Iwate Prefectural Chubu Hospital, Iwate, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Soma General Hospital, Fukushima, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokyo Metropolitan Children's Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital & Atomic-bomb Survivors Hospital, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Japan Community Healthcare Organization Tokuyama Central Hospital, Tokuyama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, St. Luke's International Hospital, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Biology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Human Health Sciences, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Ehime, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Clinical Research Center, National Hospital Organization Nagoya Medical Center, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180807,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dasatinib/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*dasatinib', '*imatinib', '*nilotinib']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27368 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Dec;65(12):e27368. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27368.

However, the treatment response rate is low. The molecular mechanisms underlying the resistance to demethylation therapy are unclear. Though a wide range of predictors of treatment response have been investigated, no consensus has been reached. It is imperative to identify certain parameters that can help distinguish between patients who will obtain a favorable outcome from demethylation therapy and those who will not.

The marine environment has been a prolific contributor towards the identification of novel therapeutic agents in the recent few decades. Added to this, glycans (or carbohydrate- or sugar-based compounds) have in very recent decades made outstanding contributions to the development of novel therapeutics. This review brings together these significant facets of modern drug discovery by presenting the reported literature on glycans derived from marine organisms that possess antiviral activity.The glycans have been grouped together based on the marine organism they were isolated from, namely, (1) bacteria, (2) chromists, (3) plants and (4) animals. For chromists, glycans are further subsectioned into Ochrophyta (brown algae), Miozoa (according to www.algaebase.org ; also called Myzozoa according to WoRMS, www.marinespecies.org ) (dinoflagellates) and Bacillariophyta (diatoms). For plants, glycans are further subsectioned into Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta and Tracheophyta. Glycans isolated to date are reported as alginates, chitosan, extracellular polysaccharides, fucans (e.g. fucoidans), galactans (e.g. carrageenans), glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, glycosides, glycosylated haemocyanin, laminarans, mannans, polysaccharides (not defined), rhamnans and xylomannans. Interestingly, many of the glycans displaying antiviral properties are sulfated.Reports indicate that marine-sourced glycans have exhibited antiviral activity against African swine fever virus, cytomegalovirus, dengue virus, Epstein-Barr virus, encephalomyocarditis virus, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, herpes simplex virus, human cytomegalovirus, human papilloma virus, human rhino virus, influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, murine leukaemia virus, murine sarcoma virus, Newcastle disease virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Semliki Forest virus, tobacco mosaic virus, vaccinia virus, varicella zoster virus, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus and vesicular stomatitis virus.

There have been few case reports of tacrolimus toxicity (>30 ng/mL) in solid organ recipients as well as in nontransplant patients. Several case reports suggest phenytoin and rifampin decrease tacrolimus levels in toxicity, but does it actually make a difference? A 60-year-old man with acute myeloblastic leukemia after allogenic stem cell transplant with fever, diarrhea, and abdominal pain was transferred to the intensive care unit for persistent hypotension and acute hypoxic respiratory failure requiring intubation. The following day his tacrolimus level was 8.6 ng/mL and creatinine was 2.2 (baseline = 1.8). The patient inadvertently received 15 mg intravenous tacrolimus instead of his scheduled 0.5 mg intravenous. Four hours later, a random tacrolimus level was 36.4 ng/mL. Tacrolimus was discontinued; phenytoin 200 mg BID was started for 4 doses and rifampin was started for 2 doses at 600 mg. Sixteen hours postinjection, tacrolimus level decreased to 26.4 ng/mL and to 9 ng/mL after 64 hours. Creatinine improved to 1.1 after 30 hours. He was extubated 5 days later without any new neurological findings and his creatinine returned to baseline. Our patient received 30 times his daily dose resulting high tacrolimus levels. Assuming there was sufficient time for distribution, our patient's half-life increased to 34.5 hours compared with the reported half-life of 12 hours. The possibilities for this increase include ineffective or harmful effects of the phenytoin/rifampin combination, change in metabolism kinetics at high levels, or other unidentified patient-specific factors. Further studies should be done to ensure that phenytoin and rifampin are safe to give in tacrolimus toxicity.",,"['Lawson, Benjamin O', 'Seth, Heemesh', 'Quan, Dan']","['Lawson BO', 'Seth H', 'Quan D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5733-3701'],"['Honor Health, Internal Medicine Residency, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Honor Health, Internal Medicine Residency, Scottsdale, AZ, USA.', 'Maricopa Integrated Health System, Department of Emergency Medicine, Phoenix, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Emergency Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Arizona, Phoenix, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180324,United States,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep,Journal of investigative medicine high impact case reports,101624758,,,,PMC6062773,['NOTNLM'],"['bone marrow transplant', 'phenytoin', 'rifampin', 'tacrolimus toxicity']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests: The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",2018/08/08 06:00,2018/08/08 06:01,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2017/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/02/05 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2324709618765862 [doi]', '10.1177_2324709618765862 [pii]']",epublish,J Investig Med High Impact Case Rep. 2018 Mar 24;6:2324709618765862. doi: 10.1177/2324709618765862. eCollection 2018 Jan-Dec.,,2324709618765862,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While quarantine and antiretroviral drug treatment are possible control measures, they are impractical, leaving vaccination as the only realistic option. In this study, we examined the effect of a recombinant envelope protein-based anti-KoRV vaccine in two groups of South Australian koalas: KoRV infected or KoRV free. We report a successful vaccination response in the koalas with no vaccine-associated side effects. The vaccine induced a significant humoral immune response as well as the production of neutralizing antibodies in both groups of koalas. We also identified B-cell epitopes that were differentially recognized in KoRV-infected versus KoRV-free koalas following vaccination. Importantly, we also showed that vaccination had a therapeutic effect on koalas infected exogenously with KoRV by reducing their circulating viral load. Together, this study highlights the possibility of successfully developing a vaccine against KoRV infection in koalas.",,"['Olagoke, O', 'Miller, D', 'Hemmatzadeh, F', 'Stephenson, T', 'Fabijan, J', 'Hutt, P', 'Finch, S', 'Speight, N', 'Timms, P']","['Olagoke O', 'Miller D', 'Hemmatzadeh F', 'Stephenson T', 'Fabijan J', 'Hutt P', 'Finch S', 'Speight N', 'Timms P']",,"['1Genecology Research Center, Faculty of Science, Health, Education and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Drive, Sippy Downs, QLD 4556 Australia.0000 0001 1555 3415grid.1034.6', '2School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA 5371 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7304grid.1010.0', '2School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA 5371 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7304grid.1010.0', '2School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA 5371 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7304grid.1010.0', '2School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA 5371 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7304grid.1010.0', 'The Adelaide Koala and Wildlife Hospital, Plympton, SA 5038 Australia.', 'The Adelaide Koala and Wildlife Hospital, Plympton, SA 5038 Australia.', '2School of Animal and Veterinary Sciences, The University of Adelaide, Roseworthy, SA 5371 Australia.0000 0004 1936 7304grid.1010.0', '1Genecology Research Center, Faculty of Science, Health, Education and Engineering, University of the Sunshine Coast, 90 Sippy Downs Drive, Sippy Downs, QLD 4556 Australia.0000 0001 1555 3415grid.1034.6']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180802,England,NPJ Vaccines,NPJ vaccines,101699863,,,,PMC6072795,,,['The authors declare no competing interests.'],2018/08/08 06:00,2018/08/08 06:01,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41541-018-0066-4 [doi]', '66 [pii]']",epublish,NPJ Vaccines. 2018 Aug 2;3:30. doi: 10.1038/s41541-018-0066-4. eCollection 2018.,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in general mAbs alone have limited therapeutic activity. One of their main mechanisms of action is to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), which is mediated by natural killer (NK) cells. Unfortunately, most cancer patients have severe immune dysfunctions affecting NK activity. This can be circumvented by the injection of allogeneic, expanded NK cells, which is safe. Nevertheless, despite their strong cytolytic potential against different tumors, clinical results have been poor. Methods: We combined allogeneic NK cells and mAbs to improve cancer treatment. We generated expanded NK cells (e-NK) with strong in vitro and in vivo ADCC responses against different tumors and using different therapeutic mAbs, namely rituximab, obinutuzumab, daratumumab, cetuximab and trastuzumab. Results: Remarkably, e-NK cells can be stored frozen and, after thawing, armed with mAbs. They mediate ADCC through degranulation-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Furthermore, they overcome certain anti-apoptotic mechanisms found in leukemic cells. Conclusion: We have established a new protocol for activation/expansion of NK cells with high ADCC activity. The use of mAbs in combination with e-NK cells could potentially improve cancer treatment.",,"['Sanchez-Martinez, Diego', 'Allende-Vega, Nerea', 'Orecchioni, Stefania', 'Talarico, Giovanna', 'Cornillon, Amelie', 'Vo, Dang-Nghiem', 'Rene, Celine', 'Lu, Zhao-Yang', 'Krzywinska, Ewelina', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Galvez, Eva M', 'Pardo, Julian', 'Robert, Bruno', 'Martineau, Pierre', 'Hicheri, Yosr', 'Bertolini, Francesco', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Villalba, Martin']","['Sanchez-Martinez D', 'Allende-Vega N', 'Orecchioni S', 'Talarico G', 'Cornillon A', 'Vo DN', 'Rene C', 'Lu ZY', 'Krzywinska E', 'Anel A', 'Galvez EM', 'Pardo J', 'Robert B', 'Martineau P', 'Hicheri Y', 'Bertolini F', 'Cartron G', 'Villalba M']",,"['IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'University of Zaragoza/Institute of Health Research of Aragon (IIS-Aragon), Spain.', 'Instituto de Carboquimica, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas (CSIC).', 'University of Zaragoza/Institute of Health Research of Aragon (IIS-Aragon), Spain.', 'IRCM, INSERM U1194, Univ Montpellier, France.', 'IRCM, INSERM U1194, Univ Montpellier, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, France."", 'Laboratory of Hematology-Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, Univ Montpellier, France."", 'IRMB, Univ Montpellier, INSERM, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'IRMB, CHU Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180614,Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)']",,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*administration & dosage', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Mice, SCID', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6071536,['NOTNLM'],"['*NK cells', '*antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC)', '*cancer', '*monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)']",['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],2018/08/08 06:00,2019/08/27 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.25149 [doi]', 'thnov08p3856 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2018 Jun 14;8(14):3856-3869. doi: 10.7150/thno.25149. eCollection 2018.,14,3856-3869,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is also the first person born in the United States to be canonized a saint. The second of three cures attributed to the intercession of Mother Seton was of Anne Theresa O'Neill. Anne was born at Baltimore in 1947 and, at the age of four, was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia at St. Agnes Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland. At the time, acute leukemia, like other aggressive malignancies, was considered a fatal disease without any treatment that assured a cure. In essence, no effective therapy for disease control and sustained remission existed. Anne's cure, which was considered acceptable by the Sacred Congregation of Rights in 1959, would contribute directly toward Mother Seton's beatification and ultimate canonization on September 14, 1975, outside Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome by Pope Paul VI.

We show that HLX overexpression leads to downregulation of genes encoding electron transport chain (ETC) components and upregulation of PPARdelta gene expression in zebrafish and human HSPCs. HLX overexpression also results in AMPK activation. Pharmacological modulation of PPARdelta signaling relieves the HLX-induced myeloid differentiation block and rescues HSPC loss upon HLX knockdown but it has no effect on AML cell lines. In contrast, AMPK inhibition results in reduced viability of AML cell lines, but minimally affects myeloid progenitors.

The major source of adipocytes comes from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), although their roles in obesity remain unclear. An understanding of the mechanisms, regulation, and outcomes of adipogenesis is crucial for the development of new treatments for obesity-related diseases. Recently an unexpected role for the tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) in hematopoietic stem cell biology and metabolism regulation has come to light, but its role in MSC biology remains unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular pathway underlying the role of PML in the control of adipogenic MSC differentiation. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) obtained from mice and voluntary patients (as a source of MSCs) were cultured in the presence of high glucose (HG) concentration, a nutrient stress condition known to promote MSCs differentiation into mature adipocytes and the adipogenic potential of PML was assessed. RESULTS: PML is essential for a correct HG-dependent adipogenic differentiation, and the enhancement of PML levels is fundamental during adipogenesis. Increased PML expression enables the upregulation of protein kinase Cbeta (PKCbeta), which, in turn, by controlling autophagy levels permits an increase in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) that leads the adipogenic differentiation. Therefore, genetic and pharmacological depletion of PML prevents PKCbeta expression, and by increasing autophagy levels, impairs the MSCs adipogenic differentiation. Human ADSCs isolated from overweight patients displayed increased PML and PKCbeta levels compared to those found in normal weight individuals, indicating that the PML-PKCbeta pathway is directly involved in the enhancement of adipogenesis and human metabolism.

This study was undertaken to provide data on demographics and outcomes of patients with PTCL who underwent treatment in a single tertiary care centre in southern India. Methods: Retrospective study was done on all patients (age >/=18 yr) diagnosed with PTCL from January 2007 to December 2012. The diagnosis of PTCL was made according to the WHO Classification of Tumors of Hematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues. Results: A total of 244 adult patients were diagnosed with PTCL (non-cutaneous). The most common subtype was PTCL-not otherwise specified (35.7%), followed by anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), ALK negative (21.3%), natural killer/T cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), ALCL, ALK positive, hepatosplenic T cell lymphoma (HSTCL) and adult T cell leukaemia/lymphoma followed in frequency with 13.1, 11.5, 8.6, 8.2 and 1.6 per cent cases, respectively.

Chylothorax was diagnosed by demonstrating high triglyceride content in the pleural fluid and a low cholesterol concentration in relation to the serum cholesterol. Cytology for malignant cells and investigations for tuberculosis were performed in all patients. Initial management included placement of an intercostal tube and administration of a fat-free diet with the addition of medium-chain triglycerides. Appropriate treatment of the underlying malignancy was initiated simultaneously. Three children with diagnoses of Stage IV neuroblastoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and Hodgkin lymphoma developed chylothorax. Malignant cytology was positive in the patient with T-NHL. All patients were found to have associated hypoproteinemia and hypoalbuminemia. The chylothorax resolved with conservative measures in two patients.

An audit of measures and outcomes was done for a 7-year period from January 2010 to December 2016. MATERIALS AND METHODS: DMG protocols and patient support activities over the study period were documented and audited. Data was retrieved from internal databases and records. Measures taken and their impact were assessed by descriptive analytical tools. Survival outcomes were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method on SPSS v. 24 software. RESULTS: Holistic patient support measures were undertaken through a charitable foundation entirely under pediatric oncology. Activities included infrastructure growth, socioeconomic support, provision of accommodation, nutrition, education, and multiple blood component donation drives. Patient registrations increased from 502 in 2009 to 874 in 2016, with the steepest rise in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) - 330 (2009) to 547 (2016). Treatment refusal and abandonment rates decreased from 32% to 3.4% over the same period, and male to female ratio decreased from 2.56 to 2.28:1. Early mortality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) fell within 2 years from 26.7% in 2009 to 7%. Five-year overall survival (OS) was 69.5% for all patients registered in 2010, whereas disease-specific 5-year OS was ALL 67.1%, AML 49.3%, chronic myeloid leukemia 100%, Hodgkin lymphoma 90.4%, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma 74.2%.

Targeting cell metabolism is a promising avenue for future cancer therapy. We found that enzymes involved in metabolic hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP) are increased in patients with AML. Inhibiting GFAT (the rate-limiting enzyme of HBP) induced differentiation and apoptosis in AML cells, sparing normal cells. UDP-GlcNAc, the end product of HBP, is the substrate for O-GlcNAcylation, a posttranslational modification. O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is the enzyme which transfers GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc to target proteins. Inhibition of O-GlcNAcylation, using OGT inhibitors as well as genetic knockdown of OGT, also led to cell differentiation and apoptosis of AML cells. Finally, HBP inhibition in vivo reduced the tumor growth in a subcutaneous AML xenograft model and tumor cells showed signs of differentiation in vivo A circulating AML xenograft model also showed clearance of tumor load in bone marrow, spleen, and blood, after HBP inhibition, with no signs of general toxicity. This study reveals an important role of HBP/O-GlcNAcylation in keeping AML cells in an undifferentiated state and sheds light into a new area of potential AML therapy by HBP/O-GlcNAc inhibition.

However, the implications of CD40L/IL-4 for the translation of specific genes is not known. To determine the most highly translationally regulated genes in response to CD40L/IL-4, we carried out ribosome profiling, a next-generation sequencing method. Significant differences in the translational efficiency of DNA damage response genes, specifically ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) and the MRE11/RAD50/NBN (MRN) complex, were observed between patients, suggesting different patterns of translational regulation. We confirmed associations between CD40L/IL-4 response and baseline ATM levels, induction of ATM, and phosphorylation of the ATM targets, p53 and H2AX.

However, the biological role for Set4 and its potential function in chromatin regulation has not been well defined. Here, we analyzed yeast cell phenotypes associated with loss of Set4 or its overexpression, which revealed that Set4 protects against oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. Gene expression analysis indicated that Set4 promotes the activation of stress response genes in the presence of oxidative insults. Using ChIP analysis and other biochemical assays, we also found that Set4 interacts with chromatin and directly localizes to stress response genes upon oxidative stress. However, recombinant Set4 did not show detectable methyltransferase activity on histones. Our findings also suggest that Set4 abundance in the cell is balanced under normal and stress conditions to promote survival. Overall, these results suggest a model in which Set4 is a stress-responsive, chromatin-associated protein that activates gene expression programs required for cellular protection against oxidative stress. This work advances our understanding of mechanisms that protect cells during oxidative stress and further defines the role of the Set3-Set4 subfamily of SET domain-containing proteins in controlling gene expression in response to adverse environmental conditions.",['(c) 2018 Tran et al.'],"['Tran, Khoa', 'Jethmalani, Yogita', 'Jaiswal, Deepika', 'Green, Erin M']","['Tran K', 'Jethmalani Y', 'Jaiswal D', 'Green EM']",,"['From the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250.', 'From the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250.', 'From the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250.', 'From the Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, Maryland 21250 egreen@umbc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180806,United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (set4 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Set3 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'Z30RAY509F (Ergosterol)']",IM,"['Chromatin/*metabolism', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Ergosterol/biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal/*physiology', '*Genes, Fungal', 'Histone Deacetylases/metabolism/physiology', 'Histones/metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Stress, Physiological/*genetics']",PMC6139553,['NOTNLM'],"['*SET domain', '*Set4', '*chromatin', '*chromatin regulation', '*gene expression', '*gene regulation', '*oxidative stress', '*stress response', '*yeast']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/04/10 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)30914-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA118.003078 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2018 Sep 14;293(37):14429-14443. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA118.003078.

MDS leads to ineffective hematopoiesis, and as many as 30% of patients progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mechanisms by which mutations accumulate in HSC during aging remain poorly understood. Here we identify a novel role for MYBL2 in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair in HSC. In patients with MDS, low MYBL2 levels associated with and preceded transcriptional deregulation of DNA repair genes. Stem/progenitor cells from these patients display dysfunctional DSB repair kinetics after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). Haploinsufficiency of Mybl2 in mice also led to a defect in the repair of DSBs induced by IR in HSC and was characterized by unsustained phosphorylation of the ATM substrate KAP1 and telomere fragility. Our study identifies MYBL2 as a crucial regulator of DSB repair and identifies MYBL2 expression levels as a potential biomarker to predict cellular response to genotoxic treatments in MDS and to identify patients with defects in DNA repair. Such patients with worse prognosis may require a different therapeutic regimen to prevent progression to AML.Significance: These findings suggest MYBL2 levels may be used as a biological biomarker to determine the DNA repair capacity of hematopoietic stem cells from patients with MDS and as a clinical biomarker to inform decisions regarding patient selection for treatments that target DNA repair.Graphical Abstract: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/78/20/5767/F1.large.jpg Cancer Res; 78(20); 5767-79.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Herein, we present a retrospective study of 126 newly diagnosed patients with AML performed in 2 French centers. RESULTS: FLT3-TKD mutations represented 12.7% of patients, whereas FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation was observed in 20.6% of AML cases and 1.6% of patients harbored both anomalies. At diagnosis, FLT3-TKD and FLT3-ITD were associated with higher peripheral leukocytes count and a higher blast count in bone marrow (P < 10(-4)). Mutations of the NPM1 gene were frequently associated to FLT3-TKD (68.7%) and FLT3-ITD (61.5%) mutations compared with FLT3 wild type (WT) patients (P < 10(-4)). Patients with both FLT3-TKD and NPM1 mutations (n = 12; 9.5%) showed a favorable outcome. Interestingly, mutations in NPM1 gene lost their favorable prognostic when not associated with FLT3-TKD both in univariate and multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that FLT3-TKD mutations should be routinely determined at the time of diagnosis.

RESULTS: In the nonstudy cohort, 80 mutations were identified; the most frequent was T315I (15%), followed by phosphate-binding loop mutations E255K (11%), G250E (10%), and Y253H (10%). Asian patients had a greater proportion of T315I and phosphate-binding loop mutations compared with the white patients. The nonstudy cohort was less likely to have multiple mutations compared with either study cohort.

The aim of the present study was to determine the correlations of WT1 expression at the diagnosis of AML with established prognostic alterations. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed diagnostic bone marrow samples from 252 patients. WT1 expression, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the WT1 gene (rs16754), and Fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutation were analyzed for all patients. The nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutation and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha (CEBPA) double mutation were analyzed for cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML. The KIT mutation was analyzed for core-binding factor AML. RESULTS: Within the cytogenetically favorable prognosis group, WT1 expression in AML with inv(16) or t(15;17) was significantly greater than that in AML with t(8;21). In cases with CN-AML, FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations both correlated with greater expression of WT1, and the CEBPA double mutation was related to lower WT1 expression. The existence of both FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations showed synergistically greater expression of WT1 in CN-AML. SNP in the WT1 gene (rs16754) was significantly associated with lower expression of WT1. The WT1 levels were not prognostic factors in the total cohort or any cytogenetic group or stratified by SNP status.

In recent days, controversial relationships were reported between TAP polymorphisms and cancer risk, thus, a systematic meta-analysis was performed to resolve this discrepancy. METHODS: We searched the PubMed, EMbase, Web of Science, CNKI and Wanfang databases, the cited references were also manually searched again, covering all the papers published until March 25, 2018. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. All the meta-analysis was conducted with Stata version 12.0 software to assess the strength of the association. RESULTS: 4719 cases and 4215 controls from 24 case-control studies related to TAP polymorphisms were enrolled. There was no significant association between TAP1-rs1135216, TAP1-rs4148873, TAP2-rs2228396, TAP2-rs241447 and TAP2-rs4148873 and cancer sensibility. Interestingly, a significant positive association was observed between TAP2 rs4148876 C/T polymorphism and increase cancer risk in homozygote and recessive models. Further in-silico results indicated the expression of TAP2 in cancer tissue is higher than that in normal tissue (cervical cancer, TPM = 70.2 vs. 24.0 respectively, P < 0.01; acute myeloid leukemia, TPM = 52.5 vs. 8.8 respectively, P < 0.01), and influence the survival time of acute myeloid leukemia patients (Log-rank P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding suggested that TAP1-rs1135216, TAP1-rs4148873, TAP2-rs2228396, TAP2-rs241447 and TAP2-rs4148873 might not be involved in cancer risk, but the T allele of TAP2-rs4148876 might be a potential biomarker for judging cancer risk, and larger-scale studies are required to confirm our findings.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

SIRT2 expression increases in acute myeloid leukemia blasts. Downregulation of SIRT2 using siRNA causes apoptosis of HeLa cells. Therefore, selective inhibitors of SIRT2 are candidate therapeutic agents for cancer. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) is a T-cell malignancy that has a poor prognosis and develops after long-term infection with human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-1. Sirtuin 1 inhibition has been shown to induce apoptosis and autophagy in HTLV-1-infected cell lines, whereas the effects of SIRT2 inhibition alone have not been elucidated. METHODS: We assessed the efficacy of our small molecule selective SIRT2 inhibitors NCO-90/141 to induce leukemic cell death. Cell viability was examined using the cell proliferation reagent Cell Count Reagent SF. Apoptotic cells were detected by annexin V-FITC and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assays by flow cytometry. Caspase activity was detected using an APOPCYTO Intracellular Caspase Activity Detection Kit. The presence of autophagic vacuoles was assessed using a Cyto-ID Autophagy Detection Kit. RESULTS: Our novel small molecule SIRT2-specific inhibitors NCO-90/141 inhibited cell growth of leukemic cell lines including HTLV-1-transformed T-cells. NCO-90/141 induced apoptosis via caspase activation and mitochondrial superoxide generation in leukemic cell lines. However, a caspase inhibitor did not prevent this caspase-associated cell death. Interestingly, NCO-90/141 increased the LC3-II level together with autophagosome accumulation, indicating autophagic cell death. Thus, NCO-90/141 simultaneously caused apoptosis and autophagy. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that NCO-90/141 are highly effective against leukemic cells in caspase-dependent or -independent manners via autophagy, and they may have a novel therapeutic potential for treatment of leukemias including ATL.",,"['Kozako, Tomohiro', 'Mellini, Paolo', 'Ohsugi, Takeo', 'Aikawa, Akiyoshi', 'Uchida, Yu-Ichiro', 'Honda, Shin-Ichiro', 'Suzuki, Takayoshi']","['Kozako T', 'Mellini P', 'Ohsugi T', 'Aikawa A', 'Uchida YI', 'Honda SI', 'Suzuki T']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan. kozako@fukuoka-u.ac.jp.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Rakuno Gakuen University, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kyoto, Japan.', 'CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180806,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (MAP1LC3B protein, human)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 2)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirtuin 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Superoxides/metabolism']",PMC6091197,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', 'Apoptosis', 'Caspase-independent cell death', 'Human T-cell leukemia virus-1', 'SIRT2']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2019/01/08 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4710-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4710-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Aug 6;18(1):791. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4710-1.,1,791,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aberrant RTK signaling is implicated in the pathogenesis of a variety of solid tumors, suggesting that inhibiting quizartinib-sensitive RTKs may be beneficial in precision cancer therapy. METHODS: This was a phase 1, open-label, modified Fibonacci dose-escalation study of orally administered quizartinib in patients with advanced solid tumors whose disease progressed despite standard therapy or for which there was no available standard treatment. Patients received quizartinib dihydrochloride (henceforth referred to as quizartinib) once daily throughout a 28-day treatment cycle. The primary endpoint was evaluation of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of quizartinib. Secondary endpoints included preliminary evidence of antitumor activity and determination of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of quizartinib. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled. Five patients received a starting dose of quizartinib 135 mg/day; dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of grade 3 pancytopenia, asymptomatic grade 3 QTc prolongation, and febrile neutropenia were observed in 1 patient each at this dose. A lower dose of quizartinib (90 mg/day [n = 8]) was administered without DLTs. The most common treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were fatigue (n = 7, 54%), dysgeusia (n = 5, 38%), neutropenia (n = 3, 23%), and QTc prolongation (n = 3, 23%). Overall, all patients experienced at least 1 AE, and 4 experienced serious AEs (2 patients each in the 135-mg and 90-mg dose groups) including hematologic AEs, infections, and gastrointestinal disorders. Six patients (including 3 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GIST]) had a best response of stable disease. CONCLUSION: The MTD of quizartinib in patients with advanced solid tumors was 90 mg/day. Overall, the safety and tolerability of quizartinib were manageable, with no unexpected AEs. Quizartinib monotherapy had limited evidence of activity in this small group of patients with advanced solid tumors.

Abnormal activation of Hh pathway is responsible for tumorigenesis and maintenance of multiple cancers, and thus addressing this represents promising therapeutic opportunities. In recent years, two Hh inhibitors have been approved for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) treatment and show extraordinary clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, a series of novel agents are being developed for the treatment of several cancers, including lung cancer, leukemia, and pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, Hh inhibition fails to show satisfactory benefits in these cancer types compared with the success stories in BCC, highlighting the need for better understanding of Hh signaling in cancer. Autophagy, a conserved biological process for cellular component elimination, plays critical roles in the initiation, progression, and drug resistance of cancer, and therefore, implied potential to be targeted. Recent evidence demonstrated that Hh signaling interplays with autophagy in multiple cancers. Importantly, modulating this crosstalk exhibited noteworthy capability to sensitize primary and drug-resistant cancer cells to Hh inhibitors, representing an emerging opportunity to reboot the efficacy of Hh inhibition in those insensitive tumors, and to tackle drug resistance challenges. This review will highlight recent advances of Hh pathway and autophagy in cancers, and focus on their crosstalk and the implied therapeutic opportunities.",,"['Zeng, Xian', 'Ju, Dianwen']","['Zeng X', 'Ju D']",,"['Department of Microbiological and Biochemical Pharmacy & The Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery MOE, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China. zengxian@u.nus.edu.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Faculty of Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore 117543, Singapore. zengxian@u.nus.edu.', 'Department of Microbiological and Biochemical Pharmacy & The Key Laboratory of Smart Drug Delivery MOE, School of Pharmacy, Fudan University, Shanghai 201203, China. dianwenju@fudan.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180803,Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hedgehog Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/drug effects/*physiology', 'Hedgehog Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Precision Medicine', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",PMC6121518,['NOTNLM'],"['autophagy', 'cancer therapy', 'crosstalk', 'drug combination', 'drug resistance', 'hedgehog', 'precision medicine']",,2018/08/08 06:00,2018/11/20 06:00,['2018/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/07/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/11/20 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms19082279 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms19082279 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2018 Aug 3;19(8). pii: ijms19082279. doi: 10.3390/ijms19082279.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened a series of active styryl quinazolinones and evaluated the structure(-)activity relationship (SAR) of these small molecules in inducing C/EBPalpha expression-thereby prompting the leukemic cells to differentiate. We observed that compound 78 causes differentiation at 3 muM concentration, while 1 induces differentiation at 10 muM concentration.

Additionally, eMX2 inhibits HIV-1 and other lentiviruses, including murine leukemia virus. Previously, it was reported that hMXB repression is reduced in hMXB Delta1-25, but not in GTP-binding mutant K131A and GTP-hydrolysis mutant T151A. In contrast to this phenomenon, our study indicates that eMX2 restriction is not diminished in eMX2 Delta1-25, but is in eMX2 K127A and T147A, which correspond to hMXB K131A and T151A, respectively.

Understanding the mechanism of action of arsenic-based drugs enables more effective arsenic drugs to be developed. Cell cycle has been known to play a critical role for cell division and growth. Herein, we establish a methodology to evaluate the uptake of two arsenic-based drugs (ATO and ZIO-101) across the cell cycle in single leukemia cells, i.e., NB4 and HL60, using a double thymidine block combined with time-resolved inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). We show that cells absorb maximal amounts of both ATO and ZIO-101 in G2/M phase and minimum in S phase, and such variation is less apparent for ZIO-101 than ATO (NB4-G2/M:S = 2.5:1 for ATO and 1.6:1 for ZIO-101). We subsequently demonstrate that AQP9, an ATO transporter, is highly expressed in the G1 phase (50.2-46.9%) and minimum value was observed in the S phase (27.6-24.6%); whereas xCT, a ZIO-101 transporter, is maximally expressed in the G2/M phase (74.8-76.1%) and minimally expressed in the G1 phases (55.4-59.8%). Different expression levels of AQP9 and xCT are only partially accountable for the observed differences in arsenic uptake across cell cycle, indicative of the presence of other importers for both ATO and ZIO-101. Furthermore, we show that the cytotoxicity of ATO and ZIO-101 on NB4 cells is also cell cycle dependent, with the highest cytotoxicity at S + G2/M phase and the lowest at G1 + S phase. Our studies provide the first evidence on cell cycle dependent uptake and cytotoxicity of arsenic-based drugs at single cell levels, may have general implications for precise evaluation of other anticancer drugs by considering cell cycle phase.",,"['Zhou, Ying', 'Wang, Haibo', 'Tse, Eric', 'Li, Hongyan', 'Sun, Hongzhe']","['Zhou Y', 'Wang H', 'Tse E', 'Li H', 'Sun H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6697-6899'],"['Department of Chemistry , The University of Hong Kong , Pokfulam Road , Hong Kong , P.

Most patients diagnosed with AML are at advanced age and present with co-morbidities, so that intensive therapy such as stem cell transplantation (SCT) is impossible to provide or is accompanied by high risks for serious adverse events and treatment-related mortality. Especially for these patients, it is necessary to find out whether all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), an intermediate of vitamin A inducing terminal differentiation of leukaemic cell lines, added to chemotherapy confers increased benefit or harm when compared with the same chemotherapy alone. OBJECTIVES: This review aims to determine benefits and harms of ATRA in addition to chemotherapy compared to chemotherapy alone for adults with AML (not those with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (non-APL)). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, study registries and relevant conference proceedings up to July 2018 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also contacted experts for unpublished data. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing chemotherapy alone with chemotherapy plus ATRA in patients with all stages of AML. We excluded trials if less than 80% of participants were adults or participants with AML, and if no subgroup data were available. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included, if they had a refractory anaemia and more than 20% of blasts. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the quality of trials. We contacted study authors to obtain missing information. We used hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS; instead of the pre-planned event-free survival, as this outcome was not reported), and we calculated risk ratios (RR) for the other outcomes quality of life, on-study mortality and adverse events. We presented all measures with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the certainty of evidence using GRADE methods. MAIN RESULTS: Our search resulted in 2192 potentially relevant references, of which we included eight trials with 28 publications assessing 3998 patients. Overall, we judged the potential risk of bias of the eight included trials as moderate. Two of eight trials were published as abstracts only. All the included trials used different chemotherapy schedules and one trial only evaluated the effect of the hypomethylating agent decitabine, a drug know to affect epigenetics, in combination with ATRA.The addition of ATRA to chemotherapy resulted in probably little or no difference in OS compared to chemotherapy only (2985 participants; HR 0.94 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.02); moderate-certainty evidence). Based on a mortality rate at 24 months of 70% with chemotherapy alone, the mortality rate with chemotherapy plus ATRA was 68% (95% CI 65% to 71%).For DFS, complete response rate (CRR) and on-study mortality there was probably little or no difference between treatment groups (DFS: 1258 participants, HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; CRR: 3081 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09; on-study mortality: 2839 participants, RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.30, all moderate-certainty evidence).Three trials with 1428 participants reported the adverse events 'infection' and 'cardiac toxicity': There was probably no, or little difference in terms of infection rate between participants receiving ATRA or not (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.15; moderate-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether ATRA decreases cardiac toxicity (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.90; P = 0.02, very low certainty-evidence, however, cardiac toxicity was low).Rates and severity of diarrhoea and nausea/vomiting were assessed in two trials with 337 patients and we are uncertain whether there is a difference between treatment arms (diarrhoea: RR 2.19, 95% CI 1.07 to 4.47; nausea/vomiting: RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.85; both very low-certainty evidence).Quality of life was not reported by any of the included trials. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for a difference between participants receiving ATRA in addition to chemotherapy or chemotherapy only for the outcome OS. Regarding DFS, CRR and on-study mortality, there is probably no evidence for a difference between treatment groups. Currently, it seems the risk of adverse events are comparable to chemotherapy only.As quality of life has not been evaluated in any of the included trials, further research is needed to clarify the effect of ATRA on quality of life.",,"['Kuley-Bagheri, Yasemin', 'Kreuzer, Karl-Anton', 'Monsef, Ina', 'Lubbert, Michael', 'Skoetz, Nicole']","['Kuley-Bagheri Y', 'Kreuzer KA', 'Monsef I', 'Lubbert M', 'Skoetz N']",,"['Cochrane Haematological Malignancies Group, Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Systematic Review']",20180806,England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Diarrhea/chemically induced', 'Disease Progression', 'Heart/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infections/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Recurrence', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Vomiting/chemically induced']",PMC6513628,,,,2018/08/07 06:00,2019/01/19 06:00,['2018/08/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD011960.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2018 Aug 6;8:CD011960. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD011960.pub2.,,CD011960,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: R. M. Tuttle (Thyroid 2010; 20:257-263), at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, has enumerated the well-accepted goals of radioactive iodine therapy (RAIT) in DTC: (1) ablate residual thyroid to facilitate future surveillance, (2) ""adjuvant therapy"" for residual radioactive iodine-avid disease, and (3) a post-RAIT scan may reveal unknown local and/or distant metastases. Using these goals as a guide, the authors have critically reviewed a recent movement to decrease the use of RAIT in DTC that is being advocated by some investigators. RESULTS: As a result, a recent article has highlighted this new treatment philosophy. A 2017 publication in the Journal of Clinical Oncology (Molenaar et al, 2017 0:JCO.2017.75.0232) recommends that RAIT not be used in low- or intermediate-risk DTC. In this article, the authors claim that the RAIT risks in DTC, particularly leukemia, outweigh its potential benefits. This change, if adopted, in our opinion will have profound deleterious consequences on patient outcomes. We also have identified a major problem with the article of Molenaar et al. The authors use the American Thyroid Association's criteria for staging thyroid cancer. In our opinion, this method of staging is severely flawed. We also quantitatively compare the article's alleged risk of RAIT-induced leukemia with the benefits of RAIT for DTC. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this matter must be debated before eliminating RAIT in low- or intermediate-risk DTC. If RAIT is eliminated for these patients, many such patients will no longer benefit from the RAIT goals listed by R. M. Tuttle, including the critical advantage of potentially improved overall and event-free survival.",,"['Metter, Darlene', 'Phillips, William T', 'Walker, Ronald C', 'Blumhardt, Ralph']","['Metter D', 'Phillips WT', 'Walker RC', 'Blumhardt R']",,"['Clinical Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN (retired).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Comment']",,United States,Clin Nucl Med,Clinical nuclear medicine,7611109,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine-131)']",IM,"['*Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', '*Thyroid Neoplasms']",,,,,2018/08/07 06:00,2019/08/30 06:00,['2018/08/07 06:00'],"['2018/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/RLU.0000000000002190 [doi]', '00003072-201809000-00006 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Nucl Med. 2018 Sep;43(9):670-671. doi: 10.1097/RLU.0000000000002190.,9,670-671,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2018 Jun 20;36(18):1831-1839.

We generated a mouse model of ETP-ALL by deleting Ezh2, one of the PRC2 genes, in p53-null hematopoietic cells. The loss of Ezh2 in p53-null hematopoietic cells impeded the differentiation of ETPs and eventually induced ETP-ALL-like disease in mice, indicating that PRC2 functions as a bona fide tumor suppressor in ETPs. A large portion of PRC2 target genes acquired DNA hypermethylation of their promoters following reductions in H3K27me3 levels upon the loss of Ezh2, which included pivotal T cell differentiation-regulating genes. The reactivation of a set of regulators by a DNA-demethylating agent, but not the transduction of single regulator genes, effectively induced the differentiation of ETP-ALL cells. Thus, PRC2 protects key T cell developmental regulators from DNA hypermethylation in order to keep them primed for activation upon subsequent differentiation phases, while its insufficiency predisposes ETPs to leukemic transformation. These results revealed a previously unrecognized epigenetic switch in response to PRC2 dysfunction and provide the basis for specific rational epigenetic therapy for ETP-ALL with PRC2 insufficiency.",,"['Wang, Changshan', 'Oshima, Motohiko', 'Sato, Daisuke', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kubota, Sho', 'Aoyama, Kazumasa', 'Nakajima-Takagi, Yaeko', 'Koide, Shuhei', 'Matsubayashi, Jun', 'Mochizuki-Kashio, Makiko', 'Nakano-Yokomizo, Takako', 'Bai, Jie', 'Nagao, Toshitaka', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Sashida, Goro']","['Wang C', 'Oshima M', 'Sato D', 'Matsui H', 'Kubota S', 'Aoyama K', 'Nakajima-Takagi Y', 'Koide S', 'Matsubayashi J', 'Mochizuki-Kashio M', 'Nakano-Yokomizo T', 'Bai J', 'Nagao T', 'Kanai A', 'Iwama A', 'Sashida G']",,"['The State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Regulation and Breeding of Grassland Livestock, School of Life Sciences, Inner Mongolia University, Hohhot, China.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Life Sciences, and.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic Pathology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell and Molecular Medicine, Center for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Transcriptional Regulation in Leukemogenesis, International Research Center for Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180806,United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['EC 2.1.1.43 (Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ezh2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'DNA Methylation', 'Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genes, p53', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 2/genetics', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/*pathology']",PMC6118644,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetics', '*Hematology', '*Leukemias', '*Oncology', '*T cells']",,2018/08/07 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/08/07 06:00'],"['2017/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['94645 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI94645 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2018 Aug 31;128(9):3872-3886. doi: 10.1172/JCI94645.

TKIs efficiently target bulk CML cells; however, they are unable to eliminate the leukaemic stem cell (LSC) population that causes resistance and relapse in CML patients. In this study, we assessed the effects of parthenolide (PTL) and dimethyl amino parthenolide (DMAPT), two potent inhibitors of LSCs in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), on CML bulk and CML primitive (CD34(+) lin(-) ) cells. We found that both agents induced cell death in CML, while having little effect on the equivalent normal hematopoietic cells. PTL and DMAPT caused an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and inhibited NF-kappaB activation. PTL and DMAPT inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in G0 and G2 phases. Furthermore, we found cell cycle inhibition to correlate with down-regulation of cyclin D1 and cyclin A. In summary, our study shows that PTL and DMAPT have a strong inhibitory effect on CML cells. Given that cell cycle arrest was not dependent on ROS induction, we speculate that this effect could be a direct consequence of NF-kappaB inhibition and if this mechanism was to be evaded, PTL and DMAPT induced cell death would be potentiated.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

This approach is particularly applicable to neoplasms that are resistant to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, like T-cell leukemias and lymphomas. In this study, we tested the feasibility of targeted next-generation sequencing in profiles of diverse T-cell neoplasms and focused on the therapeutic utility of targeting activated JAK1 and JAK3 in an index case. Patients and Methods: Using Foundation One and Foundation One Heme assays, we performed genomic profiling on 91 consecutive T-cell neoplasms for alterations in 405 genes. The samples were sequenced to high uniform coverage with an Illumina HiSeq and averaged a coverage depth of greater than 500x for DNA and more than 8M total pairs for RNA. An index case of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL), which was analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing, is presented. T-PLL cells were analyzed by RNA-seq, in vitro drug testing, mass cytometry, and phospho-flow. Results: One third of the samples had genomic aberrations in the JAK-STAT pathway, most often composed of JAK1 and JAK3 gain-of-function mutations. We present an index case of a patient with T-PLL with a clonal JAK1 V658F mutation that responded to ruxolitinib therapy. After relapse developed, an expanded clone that harbored mutant JAK3 M511I and downregulation of the phosphatase, CD45, was identified. We demonstrate that the JAK missense mutations were activating, caused pathway hyperactivation, and conferred cytokine hypersensitivity. Conclusion: These results underscore the utility of profiling occurrences of resistance to standard regimens and support JAK enzymes as rational therapeutic targets for T-cell leukemias and lymphomas.",,"['Greenplate, Allison', 'Wang, Kai', 'Tripathi, Rati M', 'Palma, Norma', 'Ali, Siraj M', 'Stephens, Phil J', 'Miller, Vincent A', 'Shyr, Yu', 'Guo, Yan', 'Reddy, Nishitha M', 'Kozhaya, Lina', 'Unutmaz, Derya', 'Chen, Xueyan', 'Irish, Jonathan M', 'Dave, Utpal P']","['Greenplate A', 'Wang K', 'Tripathi RM', 'Palma N', 'Ali SM', 'Stephens PJ', 'Miller VA', 'Shyr Y', 'Guo Y', 'Reddy NM', 'Kozhaya L', 'Unutmaz D', 'Chen X', 'Irish JM', 'Dave UP']",,"['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN.', 'Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, MA.

Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are demanded. Epigenetic marks play a relevant role in AML. GSKJ4 is a novel inhibitor of the histone demethylases JMJD3 and UTX. To note GSKJ4 has been recently shown to act as a potent small molecule inhibitor of the proliferation in many cancer cell types. On the other hand, forskolin, a natural cAMP raising compound, used for a long time in traditional medicine and considered safe also in recent studies, is emerging as a very interesting molecule for possible use in cancer therapy. Here, we investigate the effects of forskolin on the sensitivity of human leukemia U937 cells to GSKJ4 through flow cytometry-based assays (cell-cycle progression and cell death), cell number counting, and immunoblotting experiments. We provide evidence that forskolin markedly potentiates GSKJ4-induced antiproliferative effects by apoptotic cell death induction, accompanied by a dramatic BCL2 protein down-regulation as well as caspase 3 activation and PARP protein cleavage. Comparable effects are observed with the phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX and 8-Br-cAMP analogous, but not by using 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP Epac activator. Moreover, the forskolin-induced enhancement of sensitivity to GSKJ4 is counteracted by pre-treatment with Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibitors. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that forskolin sensitizes U937 cells to GSKJ4 inhibitor via a cAMP/PKA-mediated mechanism. Our findings provide initial evidence of anticancer activity induced by forskolin/GSKJ4 combination in leukemia cells and underline the potential for use of forskolin and GSKJ4 in the development of innovative and effective therapeutic approaches for AML treatment.",,"['Illiano, Michela', 'Conte, Mariarosaria', 'Sapio, Luigi', 'Nebbioso, Angela', 'Spina, Annamaria', 'Altucci, Lucia', 'Naviglio, Silvio']","['Illiano M', 'Conte M', 'Sapio L', 'Nebbioso A', 'Spina A', 'Altucci L', 'Naviglio S']",,"['Department of Precision Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Campania ""Luigi Vanvitelli"", Naples, Italy.', 'IRCCS SDN, Napoli Via E.

Comprehensive research accompanied with genetic models, metabolomics analyses, and single-cell approaches have highlighted the critical contributions of metabolic control to HSC homeostasis. Consequently, the roles of mitochondrial metabolism in the HSC division symmetry have become a central focus of the current research. Nevertheless, we are only beginning to comprehend the metabolic requirements of stemness. This review summarizes the recent advances in our understanding of the intriguing relationship between mitochondrial metabolism and HSC fate decisions. In addition, this study highlights our recent findings regarding the contributions of the mitochondrial quality control by autophagy to HSC division balance.

Although the biological significance of super-enhancers is still controversial, this concept is gaining prominence as useful characteristics of genes that play crucial roles in normal development and pathogenesis of cancer. In various cancer cells, super-enhancers are often associated with genes involved in carcinogenesis. For example, in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the oncogenic transcription factor TAL1 and its regulatory partners (GATA3, RUNX1 and MYB) are regulated by super-enhancers; these genes are sensitive to transcriptional inhibition, for example, via the pharmacological approach using a small-molecule CDK7 inhibitor. This preferential inhibition of cancer genes can also be observed for other types of cancer. Based on these findings, we recently performed super-enhancer profiling combined with gene expression analysis in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, which is a genetically complicated hematological malignancy, to identify critical genes responsible for the pathogenesis.

Here, we explored the potential molecular mechanism of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 6 (eIF6) in ATPR-induced leukemia cell differentiation. Our research showed that ATPR could inhibit cell proliferation and promote cell differentiation in several leukemia cell lines. Besides, ATPR remarkably reduced the expression of eIF6 in vitro. Interestingly, the reduction of eIF6 contributed to restraining proliferation of K562cells by inhibiting CyclinD1, C-myc and blocking cell cycle, as well as promoting differentiation of K562cells by increasing the expression of C/EBPepsilon, cell surface antigen CD11b and inducing renal-shrinkage of nuclear. Furthermore, the over-expression of eIF6 restrained the effects of ATPR on cell proliferation and maturation in K562cells. In Addition, Notch1/CBF-1 signal activated by Chrysin could increase expression of eIF6 and restrain the differentiation in ATPR-induced K562cells. Taken together, all above results indicated that ATPR induced differentiation of leukemia cells by decreasing eIF6 through Notch1/CBF-1 signal, which might exert an innovative treatment for leukemia.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

A significant decrease in the viability of K562 cells was observed by the treatment of the NSC lines, HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-beta, compared with the control. A modified trans-well assay showed that engineered human NSCs significantly migrated toward K562 CML cells more than human normal lung cells. In addition, the important chemoattractant factors involved in the specific migration ability of stem cells were found to be expressed in K562 CML cells. In a xenograft mouse model, NSC treatments via subcutaneous and intravenous injections resulted in significant inhibitions of tumor mass growth and extended survival dates of the mice.

Immunotherapies to treat multiple myeloma (MM) targeted the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA), which is expressed in most cases of MM. We developed a humanized CAR with specificity for BCMA based on our previously generated anti-BCMA monoclonal antibody. The targeting single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domain exhibited a binding affinity in the low nanomolar range, conferring T cells with high functional avidity. Redirecting T cells by this CAR allowed us to explore BCMA as an alternative target for mature B-NHLs. We validated BCMA expression in diffuse large B cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. BCMA CAR T cells triggered target cell lysis with an activation threshold in the range of 100 BCMA molecules, which allowed for an efficient eradication of B-NHL cells in vitro and in vivo. Our data corroborate BCMA is a suitable target in B cell tumors beyond MM, providing a novel therapeutic option for patients where BCMA is expressed at low abundance or where anti-CD19 immunotherapies have failed due to antigen loss.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

When aging-associated CH results from acquisition of a somatic mutation in a driver gene associated with leukemia, and this mutation is present at a variant allele frequency of at least 0.02 (2%) yet the patient does not meet World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for a hematologic neoplasm, this state is termed clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CHIP is present in approximately 10% to 15% of people older than 70 years and more than 30% by age 85 years and represents a precursor state for neoplasia akin to monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Recently, CHIP was unexpectedly found to be an important risk factor for cardiovascular events, with accumulating evidence supporting a mechanism of accelerated atherogenesis as a result of vascular inflammation driven by clonally derived monocytes/macrophages. Risk factors for CHIP include aging, male sex, cigarette smoking, and a common germline variant in the telomere-associated gene TERT. Clonal hematopoiesis can also occur after cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy for a solid tumor, after hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in the context of aplastic anemia, or after induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia; in each setting, CH has distinct clinical implications. This review summarizes recent studies of CH and CHIP and outlines challenges in clinical management of affected patients.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research.

The present case reports a 30-year-old man presenting with sensory deafness. Marked leukocytosis with p210 BCR-ABL1 mRNA positivity and Philadelphia chromosome detected by bone marrow biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of CML. Dura thickening in brain MRI and immature cells with Philadelphia chromosome in spinal fluid confirmed CNS invasion of CML and he was diagnosed with BP-CML. Two cycles of hyper-CVAD/MA (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone/ high-dose methotrexate and cytarabine) therapy with dasatinib and concomitant intrathecal chemotherapy induced complete cytogenetic response and remission of CNS involvement. Bone marrow transplantation from an unrelated HLA-mismatched donor was performed and complete molecular response in bone marrow and complete remission in CNS disease was achieved.

In this review, we highlight new targeted therapies in ALL, with an emphasis on immunotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Major advances include antibody-based therapies, such as naked monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates and bispecific T cell engaging (BiTE) antibodies, as well as adoptive cellular therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. Apart from the above immunotherapeutic approaches, other targeted therapies are being employed in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) ALL, Philadelphia-like (Ph-like) ALL, and T cell ALL.

Complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy was reached in 50% of patients. Parameters influencing the probability of achieving CR were blast count in the bone marrow (< 30%), age < 65 years, presence of Auer rods, duration of antecedent MDS shorter than 6 months, and timing of IC in relation to first diagnosis. The difference in survival time was not significantly better for patients receiving IC (median OS 12.7 months vs. 7 months). Parameters favorably influencing survival were the presence of Auer rods, age below 60 years, blast count below 30%, IC given shortly after first diagnosis, and achievement of CR. On multivariate analysis, achieving CR, presence of Auer rods, and percentage of blasts below or above 30% significantly influenced median survival.

Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers were placed on peroxidase (POx) mimicking Au@Pt nanoparticles to form a nanocomposite of type Au@Pt-PAMAM. Capture DNA probe is a designed nucleic acid strand that specifically binds target DNA to the surface of the electrode. The capture probe was attached to magnetic beads via biotin and avidin interaction. The hairpin structure of the capture probe can only be opened by the complementary BCR/ABL DNA. This results in a highly specific assay. The POx-mimicking property of the Au@Pt-PAMAM causes the formation of a blue dye by reaction of H2O2 and 3,3,3',3'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) which is measured by a microplate reader. Under optimum conditions, the absorbance increases linearly the 1 pM to 100 nM BCR/ABL concentration range, and the detection limit is as low as 190 fM. The method is highly selective and was successfully applied to the determination of fusion genes in spiked real samples. Conceivably, it possesses a large potential in clinical testing of patients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia. Graphical abstract Au@PtNP, an efficient catalyst, is bound with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer to amplify the colorimetric signal.

Although generally well tolerated, serious bleeding emerged during developmental clinical trials as an unexpected, although uncommon, adverse event. As the use of ibrutinib increases outside of the clinical trial setting and in patients with more comorbidities, the rate of major bleeding could be greater. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis the data from all patients at our center and its regional clinics who had been prescribed ibrutinib from January 2012 to May 2016 were reviewed for demographic data, comorbid illnesses, bleeding events, and concurrent medications. RESULTS: We identified 70 patients. Bleeding of any grade occurred in 56% of patients, mostly grade 1 to 2 bruising and epistaxis. Major bleeding, defined as grade >/= 3, occurred in 19% of patients, greater than previously reported. Anemia (hemoglobin < 12 g/dL; hazard ratio [HR], 5.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-18.2; P = .02) and an elevated international normalized ratio (> 1.5; HR, 9.5; 95% CI, 2.7-33.5; P < .01) at ibrutinib initiation were associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Of those with major bleeding, most patients were also taking an antiplatelet agent (70%), an anticoagulant (17%), or a CYP 3A4 inhibitor (7%), with 13% taking both antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications. The use of both antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy significantly increased the risk of a major bleed event (HR, 19.2; 95% CI, 2.3-166.7; P < .01). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study have demonstrated a greater rate of major bleeding with ibrutinib use in a standard clinical setting than previously reported. Patients with anemia or an elevated international normalized ratio or requiring anticoagulant and/or antiplatelet medications during ibrutinib therapy have a significantly increased risk of major bleeding. Careful consideration of the risks and benefits for this population is needed. The combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulation medications with ibrutinib therapy is of particular concern.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

After clinical observations of patients with a personal history of both malignancies, we sought to explore a potential association, and to describe the clinical characteristics of these patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mayo Clinic's 'Advanced Cohort Explorer' database was used to identify patients with a history of both malignancies. Clinical features and long-term outcome were abstracted. Prevalence of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in patients >/= 65 years with a personal history of nephrectomy for RCC was then compared with the prevalence of MDSs in the Dusseldorf MDS registry and the general patient population at Mayo Clinic, using 1-sample test of proportions. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients with a diagnosis of both RCC and myeloid malignancy were identified. The myeloid malignancies included 38 MDSs, 12 acute myelogenous leukemia, and 9 myeloproliferative neoplasms. The cohort was characterized by marked male predominance (4.4:1). The median age at RCC diagnosis was 64 years (range, 37-87 years), and for myeloid malignancy was 75 years (range, 44-90 years). Prevalence of MDS in patients > 65 years with a personal history of nephrectomy for RCC was approximately 8.4 times that of the age-concordant general population based on the Dusseldorf registry (28/6490 or 395/100,000 vs. approximately 47/100,000; P < .001), and 3.07 times that of the age-concordant patient population at Mayo Clinic (28/6490 or 395/100,000 vs. 128.4/100,000; P < .001).

For signal amplification, pH-responsive hollow MnO2 (hMnO2) nanospheres encapsulating Ru(bpy)3Cl2 and carrying secondary antibodies (Ab2) were employed. Under optimal conditions, the immunosensor exhibited a wide ALV-J detection range of 10(1.80) to 10(4.30) TCID50/mL (TCID50: 50% tissue culture infective dose) and a low detection limit of 10(1.71) TCID50/mL (S/N=3). Importantly, the immunosensor showed high sensitivity, good reproducibility and excellent operational stability. Finally, the immunosensor was evaluated using a real avian serum sample containing ALV-J, with excellent results being achieved.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Probability of 5-year overall survival was 78% for patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 53% for chronic myelogenous leukemia, 55% for Hodgkin lymphoma, 40% for acute myelogenous leukemia, 37% for myelodysplastic syndrome, 29% for myeloma, and 14% for myeloproliferative neoplasms. Corresponding outcomes for relapse were 0%, 13%, 53%, 37%, 39%, 75%, and 29%, respectively.

Recipient cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive serostatus was protective from relapse with the lowest rates in those also receiving a CMV-positive donor graft (29%). The cumulative incidence of 2-year nonrelapse mortality was 26% and was lowest in those receiving a matched sibling graft at 21%, with low (21%) or intermediate (18%) HCT-specific comorbidity index, and was similar across age groups. The incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD was 43% and grades III to IV 27%; the highest rates were found in those receiving an unrelated donor (URD) peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft, at 50%. Chronic GVHD at 1 year was 36%. Future approaches incorporating alternative GVHD prophylaxis, particularly for URD PBSC grafts, and targeted post-transplant antineoplastic therapies for those with high DRI are indicated to improve these outcomes.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Normal HSC processes rely heavily on a complex communication network involving various marrow niches. Although leukemogenesis largely results from abnormal genetic activity within the leukemia stem cell itself, mounting evidence indicates a significant contributory role played by marrow niche dysregulation. Furthermore, numerous instances of activating or inactivating germline mutations within marrow microenvironment cells have been shown to be sufficient for development of myelodysplastic syndrome, myeloproliferative neoplasm, and acute myeloid leukemia, even in the context of wild-type HSCs. Recent evidence suggests that targeting aberrant chemokine production from germline-mutated marrow stromal cells can potentially reverse the process of leukemogenesis. This elaborate interplay between the HSC population and the marrow microenvironment allows for a number of unique clinical possibilities in efforts to induce remission, enhance chemosensitivity, manage relapsed disease, and prevent leukemia development, both in de novo and germline mutation-associated leukemias, including the use of targeted cytokine/chemokine inhibitors, immune checkpoint blockade, CXCR4/CXCL12 axis antagonists, and combined allogeneic HSC and mesenchymal stem cell transplantation. In this review, we discuss the pathways underlying normal and abnormal bone marrow niche functioning, the relationship between germline mutations in the stem cell microenvironment and dysregulated hematopoiesis, and future clinical perspectives that may be particularly applicable to prevention and treatment of germline-associated leukemias.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1) is involved in tumor progression and angiogenesis. We have previously reported that PAR1 expression is elevated in human leukemias that display a more aggressive clinical behavior, including the blast crisis of CML. In this study, we analyzed the crosstalk between the oncoprotein BCR-ABL and PAR1 in CML. Leukemic cell lines transfected with the BCR-ABL1 oncogene showed significantly higher expression levels of PAR1 compared with that of wild-type counterparts. This phenomenon was reversed by treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Conversely, treatment with the PAR1 antagonist SCH79797 inhibited BCR-ABL expression. The PAR1 antagonist induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Higher vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were observed in cells transfected with BCR-ABL1 than in their wild-type counterparts. VEGF expression was strongly inhibited after treatment with either TKIs or the PAR1 antagonist. Finally, we evaluated PAR1 expression in CML patients who were either in the blast or chronic phases and had either received TKI treatment or no treatment. A significant decrease in PAR1 expression was observed in treatment-responsive patients, as opposed to a significant increase in PAR1 expression levels in treatment-resistant patients. Patients classified as high risk according to the Sokal index showed higher PAR1 expression levels. Our results demonstrate the crosstalk between BCR-ABL and PAR1. These data may offer important insight into the development of new therapeutic strategies for CML.","['Copyright (c) 2018 ISEH -- Society for Hematology and Stem Cells. Published by', 'Elsevier Inc.

We previously demonstrated that OSM induces blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment. However, functional characterization of IL-6 family cytokines in BBB regulation and the cytokine-related intracellular signaling pathway remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that among IL-6 family cytokines, including IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), OSM is the most potent molecule for inducing BBB dysfunction via prolonged activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3 following Janus-activated kinase (JAK) activation. OSM but not IL-6 and LIF (100 ng/mL for 24 hours) markedly produced increased sodium fluorescein permeability and decreased transendothelial electrical resistance in rat brain endothelial cell (RBEC) monolayers. This OSM-induced BBB dysfunction was accompanied by decreased levels of claudin-5 expression in RBECs, which were ameliorated by JAK inhibitor. We examined the time-course of STAT3 phosphorylation in RBECs treated with OSM, IL-6, and LIF. OSM upregulated STAT3 phosphorylation levels during a 24 hours period with a peak at 10 minutes. While IL-6 and LIF transiently increased phosphorylated STAT3 at 10 minutes after addition, this phosphorylation decreased during the period from 1 to 24 hours after addition. These findings suggest that OSM-induced sustained increases in STAT3 phosphorylation levels largely contribute to BBB impairment. Thus, elevated OSM levels and activation of brain endothelial JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway under pathological conditions should be considered as a possible hallmark for induction and development of BBB impairment.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Takata, Fuyuko', 'Dohgu, Shinya', 'Matsumoto, Junichi', 'Machida, Takashi', 'Sakaguchi, Shinya', 'Kimura, Ikuya', 'Yamauchi, Atsushi', 'Kataoka, Yasufumi']","['Takata F', 'Dohgu S', 'Matsumoto J', 'Machida T', 'Sakaguchi S', 'Kimura I', 'Yamauchi A', 'Kataoka Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8752-7272'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Care and Health Sciences, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180804,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelial Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/pharmacology', 'Oncostatin M/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*blood-brain barrier', '*claudin-5', '*interleukin-6', '*leukemia inhibitory factor', '*oncostatin M', '*signal transducer and activator of transcription 3', '*tight junction']",,2018/08/05 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2018/03/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27162 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Nov;119(11):9055-9063. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27162.

In this review, we will discuss the different functions of the two Ebp1 isoforms, p48 and p42, that may be responsible for the potentially dual role of Ebp1 in cancer growth.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.']","['Nguyen, Dang Quan', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa', 'Nguyen Vo, Thanh Thao', 'Huynh, Vu', 'Ghoda, Lucy', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan Truong']","['Nguyen DQ', 'Hoang DH', 'Nguyen Vo TT', 'Huynh V', 'Ghoda L', 'Marcucci G', 'Nguyen LXT']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5464-0861'],"['Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnology, Biotechnology Center of Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.', 'Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematology Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180804,United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (KRT20 protein, human)', '0 (Keratin-20)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-3)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Keratin-20/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Isoforms/*genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Receptor, ErbB-3/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ebp1', '*ErbB3', '*cancer']",,2018/08/05 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/09/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.26951 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2018 Dec;233(12):9110-9120. doi: 10.1002/jcp.26951.

Despite the remarkable efficacy of T-DM1 in many patients, resistance to this therapeutic has emerged as a significant clinical problem. In the current study, we used BT-474/KR cells, a T-DM1-resistant cell line established from HER2-positive BT-474 breast cancer cells, as a model to investigate mechanisms of T-DM1 resistance and explore effective therapeutic regimens. We show here for the first time that activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) overexpression confers resistance to T-DM1. Moreover, secreted factors induced by activated STAT3 in resistant cells limit the responsiveness of cells that were originally sensitive to T-DM1. Importantly, STAT3 inhibition sensitizes resistant cells to T-DM1, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the combination T-DM1 with STAT3-targeted therapy is a potential treatment for T-DM1-refractory patients.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Therefore, we investigated the presence and functional reactivity of autoreactive T-cell responses against autologous AML blasts. METHODS: T cells purified from PB samples harvested from patients during first complete remission were stimulated with autologous AML material harvested at diagnosis. After 12-14 days of coculture, the T cells were restimulated with autologous AML cells, and leukemia-reactive T-cell clones were isolated based on their expression of the activation marker CD137. RESULTS: We demonstrated that AML-induced autoreactivity was predominantly mediated by CD4 T cells. These autoreactive T cells showed abundant cytokine production, coincided by modest cytotoxic activity. Upon coculture, the autoreactive T cells were able to increase the immunogenicity of the AML blasts. Interestingly, similar AML-directed reactivity was observed using HLA-identical responder T cells from healthy donors. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the presence of AML-directed autoreactive T cells is a common phenomenon which appears to be part of the general T-cell repertoire also in healthy individuals. This autoreactive AML-directed T-cell response may directly contribute to anti-AML immune surveillance especially in the situation of minimal residual disease, but furthermore the immune-modulatory effect on the AML phenotype may pave the way for other immunological interventions.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-XL or Mcl-1) is a hallmark of cancer and favors tumor cell survival and resistance to therapy. The oral drug venetoclax is the first-in-class Bcl-2-specific BH3 mimetic. In myeloma, in vitro sensitivity to venetoclax is mainly observed in plasma cells harboring the t(11;14) translocation, a molecular subgroup associated with high Bcl-2 and low Mcl-1/Bcl-XL expression. In addition with Bcl-2 members expression profile, functional tests as BH3 profiling or in vitro BH3 mimetic drug testing also predict sensitivity to the drug. Phase 1 clinical trials recently confirmed the efficacy of venetoclax monotherapy in heavily pretreated myeloma patients, mostly in patients with t(11;14). In combination with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, venetoclax therapy was found to be feasible and allowed promising response rate in relapsed myeloma patients, independent of t(11;14) status.

We aimed to identify the efficacy of minimal residual disease (MRD)-directed interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment in patients with t(8;21) AML who were positive for MRD after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT; n=42). SUBJECTS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: MRD-positive status was defined as a <4.5-log reduction from diagnosis in RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcripts and/or the loss of a >/=4.5-log reduction after 3 months after HSCT. Patients with positive MRD received six cycles of IFN-alpha treatment (twice or thrice weekly of every 4 weeks cycle). RESULTS: The 1-year cumulative incidence of severe acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease after MRD-directed IFN-alpha treatment was 7.1% and 4.8%, respectively. After the treatment, 15 (35.7%), 5 (11.9%), 3 (7.1%), and 9 (21.5%) patients achieved MRD negativity at 1, 2, 3, and >3 months, respectively. Three patients relapsed after the IFN-alpha treatment, in which the 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 7.2%. One patient died of severe infection at 460 days after treatment. The 1-year probabilities of event-free survival, disease-free survival, and overall survival after treatment were 76.0%, 92.4%, and 92.5%, respectively. The clinical outcomes in patients who received MRD-directed IFN-alpha treatment were significantly better than those of the MRD-positive patients without any interventions in the historical cohort. CONCLUSION: MRD-directed IFN-alpha treatment is effective for patients with t(8;21) AML who were MRD-positive after allo-HSCT. The study was registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02027064. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: In patients with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the presence of post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) minimal residual disease (MRD), measured by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels, has been established as a powerful marker for predicting relapse. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) could exert a relatively strong graft-versus-leukemia effect, and MRD-directed IFN-alpha treatment is effective for patients with t(8;21) AML who were MRD-positive after allo-HSCT.",['(c) AlphaMed Press 2018.'],"['Mo, Xiao-Dong', 'Wang, Yu', 'Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Xu, Lan-Ping', 'Yan, Chen-Hua', 'Chen, Huan', 'Chen, Yu-Hong', 'Qin, Ya-Zhen', 'Liu, Kai-Yan', 'Huang, Xiao-Jun']","['Mo XD', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang XH', 'Xu LP', 'Yan CH', 'Chen H', 'Chen YH', 'Qin YZ', 'Liu KY', 'Huang XJ']",,"[""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Peking University People's Hospital, Peking University Institute of Hematology, Beijing Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, Beijing, People's Republic of China huangxiaojun@bjmu.edu.cn."", ""Peking-Tsinghua Center for Life Sciences, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180803,United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/*methods', 'Young Adult']",PMC6291331,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*Interferon-alpha', '*Minimal residual disease', '*RUNX1-RUNX1T1']","['Disclosures of potential conflicts of interest may be found at the end of this', 'article.']",2018/08/05 06:00,2019/11/14 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2017/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['theoncologist.2017-0692 [pii]', '10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0692 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncologist. 2018 Nov;23(11):1349-1357. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.2017-0692.

Currently classified as Grade II in consensus criteria, upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease is often treated with systemic immunosuppression. We reviewed the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research database to assess the prognostic implications of upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease in isolation or with other acute graft-versus-host disease manifestations. 8567 adult recipients of myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant receiving T-cell replete grafts for acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between 2000 and 2012 were analyzed. 51% of transplants were from unrelated donors. Reported upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease incidence was 12.1%; 2.7% of recipients had isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease, of whom 95% received systemic steroids. Patients with isolated upper gastrointestinal involvement had similar survival, disease-free survival, transplant-related mortality, and relapse as patients with Grades 0, I, or II acute graft-versus-host disease. Unrelated donor recipients with isolated upper gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host disease had less subsequent chronic graft-versus-host disease than those with Grades I or II disease (P=0.016 and P=0.0004, respectively). Upper gastrointestinal involvement added no significant prognostic information when present in addition to other manifestations of Grades I or II acute graft-versus-host disease.

It has entered phase I clinical studies. Here, we have assessed the utility of BAY 1143572 for treating natural killer (NK) cell leukemias/lymphomas that have a poor prognosis, namely extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and aggressive NK-cell leukemia, in a preclinical mouse model in vivo as well as in tissue culture models in vitro Seven NK-cell leukemia/lymphoma lines and primary aggressive NK-cell leukemia cells from two individual patients were treated with BAY 1143572 in vitro Primary tumor cells from an aggressive NK-cell leukemia patient were used to establish a xenogeneic murine model for testing BAY 1143572 therapy. Cyclin-dependent kinase 9 inhibition by BAY 1143572 resulted in prevention of phosphorylation at the serine 2 site of the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. This resulted in lower c-Myc and Mcl-1 levels in the cell lines, causing growth inhibition and apoptosis. In aggressive NK-cell leukemia primary tumor cells, exposure to BAY 1143572 in vitro resulted in decreased Mcl-1 protein levels resulting from inhibition of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphorylation at the serine 2 site. Orally administering BAY 1143572 once per day to aggressive NK-cell leukemia-bearing mice resulted in lower tumor cell infiltration into the bone marrow, liver, and spleen, with less export to the periphery relative to control mice. The treated mice also had a survival advantage over the untreated controls.

Pharmacologic inhibition of fatty acid oxidation, thereby, displays significant effects in suppressing leukemia. 2-Bromopalmitate, a palmitate analogue, was initially identified as an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, and recently recognized as an inhibitor of protein palmitoylation. However, the effects of 2-Bromopalmitate on leukemia and its cellular targets remain obscure. Herein, we discover in cultured cell lines, a transplantable mouse model, and primary blasts that 2-Bromopalmitate presents synergistic differentiation induction with all-trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia. Moreover, 2-Bromopalmitate overcomes all-trans retinoic acid resistance in all-trans retinoic acid-resistant cells and leukemic mice. Mechanistically, 2-Bromopalmitate covalently binds at cysteine 105 and cysteine 174 of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARalpha) and stabilizes RARalpha protein in the presence of all-trans retinoic acid which is known to induce RARalpha degradation, leading to enhanced transcription of RARalpha-target genes. Mutation of both cysteines largely abrogates the synergistic effect of 2-Bromopalmitate on all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation, demonstrating that 2-Bromopalmitate promotes all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation through binding RARalpha. All-trans retinoic acid-based regimens including arsenic trioxide or chemotherapy, as preferred therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia, induce adverse events and irreversible resistance. We expect that combining all-trans retinoic acid with 2-Bromopalmitate would be a promising therapeutic strategy for acute promyelocytic leukemia, especially for overcoming all-trans retinoic acid resistance of relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Lu, Ying', 'Yan, Jin-Song', 'Xia, Li', 'Qin, Kang', 'Yin, Qian-Qian', 'Xu, Hong-Tao', 'Gao, Meng-Qing', 'Qu, Xiao-Ning', 'Sun, Yu-Ting', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang']","['Lu Y', 'Yan JS', 'Xia L', 'Qin K', 'Yin QQ', 'Xu HT', 'Gao MQ', 'Qu XN', 'Sun YT', 'Chen GQ']",,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM) stove@shsmu.edu.cn chengq@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM).', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM).', 'Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies, ShanghaiTech University, China.', 'Shanghai Institute for Advanced Immunochemical Studies, ShanghaiTech University, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University.', 'Department of Hematology, Dalian Key Laboratory of Hematology, Liaoning Medical Center for Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, the Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of the Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine (SJTU-SM) stove@shsmu.edu.cn chengq@shsmu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180803,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Palmitates)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '18263-25-7 (2-bromopalmitate)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*agonists/metabolism', 'Palmitates/*pharmacology', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*agonists/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6312026,,,,2018/08/05 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2018/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.191916 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.191916 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jan;104(1):102-112. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.191916.

The etiologies of anemia are complex and include reactive as well as neoplastic conditions. Clonal expansion of erythroid cells in the bone marrow may result in peripheral erythrocytosis and polycythemia but can also result in anemia when clonal cells are dysplastic and have a maturation arrest that leads to apoptosis and hinders migration, a constellation typically seen in the myelodysplastic syndromes. Rarely, clonal expansion of immature erythroid blasts results in a clinical picture resembling erythroid leukemia. Although several mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal erythropoiesis and the pathogenesis of related disorders have been deciphered in recent years, little is known about specific markers and targets through which prognosis and therapy could be improved in anemic or polycythemic patients. In order to discuss new markers, targets and novel therapeutic approaches in erythroid disorders and the related pathologies, a workshop was organized in Vienna in April 2017. The outcomes of this workshop are summarized in this review, which includes a discussion of new diagnostic and prognostic markers, the updated WHO classification, and an overview of new drugs used to stimulate or to interfere with erythropoiesis in various neoplastic and reactive conditions.

Optimal levels of MYB are required for transformation/maintenance of BCR-ABL-expressing cells. We investigated whether MYB silencing modulates microRNA expression in Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) leukemia cells and if MYB-regulated microRNAs are important for the ""MYB addiction"" of these cells. Thirty-five microRNAs were modulated by MYB silencing in lymphoid and erythromyeloid chronic myeloid leukemia-blast crisis BV173 and K562 cells; 15 of these were concordantly modulated in both lines. We focused on the miR-17-92 cluster because of its oncogenic role in tumors and found that: i) it is a direct MYB target; ii) it partially rescued the impaired proliferation and enhanced apoptosis of MYB-silenced BV173 cells. Moreover, we identified FRZB, a Wnt/beta-catenin pathway inhibitor, as a novel target of the miR-17-92 cluster. High expression of MYB in blast cells from 2 Ph(+)leukemia patients correlated positively with the miR-17-92 cluster and inversely with FRZB. This expression pattern was also observed in a microarray dataset of 122 Ph(+)acute lymphoblastic leukemias. In vivo experiments in NOD scid gamma mice injected with BV173 cells confirmed that FRZB functions as a Wnt/beta-catenin inhibitor even as they failed to demonstrate that this pathway is important for BV173-dependent leukemogenesis. These studies illustrate the global effects of MYB expression on the microRNAs profile of Ph(+)cells and supports the concept that the ""MYB addiction"" of these cells is, in part, caused by modulation of microRNA-regulated pathways affecting cell proliferation and survival.",['Copyright(c) 2019 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Spagnuolo, Manuela', 'Regazzo, Giulia', 'De Dominici, Marco', 'Sacconi, Andrea', 'Pelosi, Andrea', 'Korita, Etleva', 'Marchesi, Francesco', 'Pisani, Francesco', 'Magenta, Alessandra', 'Lulli, Valentina', 'Cordone, Iole', 'Mengarelli, Andrea', 'Strano, Sabrina', 'Blandino, Giovanni', 'Rizzo, Maria G', 'Calabretta, Bruno']","['Spagnuolo M', 'Regazzo G', 'De Dominici M', 'Sacconi A', 'Pelosi A', 'Korita E', 'Marchesi F', 'Pisani F', 'Magenta A', 'Lulli V', 'Cordone I', 'Mengarelli A', 'Strano S', 'Blandino G', 'Rizzo MG', 'Calabretta B']",,"['Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Oncology-Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Oncology-Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', ""Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, FLMM, Laboratorio di Patologia Vascolare, Rome, Italy."", 'Department of Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Clinical Pathology Unit, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Oncology-Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Research, Advanced Diagnostics and Technological Innovation, Oncogenomic and Epigenetic Unit, Translational Research Area, IRCCS - Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy maria.rizzo@ifo.gov.it bruno.calabretta@jefferson.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology and Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA, USA maria.rizzo@ifo.gov.it bruno.calabretta@jefferson.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180803,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MIRN17 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYB protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Multigene Family', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6312025,,,,2018/08/05 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2018/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.191213 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.191213 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2019 Jan;104(1):82-92. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.191213.

Here we report an independent review of EFS, final overall survival (OS), and additional safety results from ALFA-0701. Patients (n=271) aged 50-70 years with de novo AML were randomized to receive conventional front-line induction chemotherapy (3+7daunorubicin+cytarabine) with/without gemtuzumab ozogamicin 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 7 during induction. Patients in remission following induction therapy received 2 courses of consolidation therapy (daunorubicin+cytarabine) with/without gemtuzumab ozogamicin (3 mg/m(2)/day on day 1) according to their initial randomization. The primary end point was investigator-assessed EFS. Secondary end points included OS and safety. A blinded independent review confirmed the investigator-assessed EFS results [August 1, 2011; hazard ratio (HR) 0.66; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.49-0.89; 2-sided P=0.006], corresponding to a 34% reduction in risk of events in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin versus control arm. Final OS at April 30, 2013 favored gemtuzumab ozogamicin but was not significant. No differences in early death rate were observed between arms. The main toxicity associated with gemtuzumab ozogamicin was prolonged thrombocytopenia. Veno-occlusive disease (including after transplant) was observed in 6 patients in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin arm and 2 in the control arm. In conclusion, gemtuzumab ozogamicin added to standard intensive chemotherapy has a favorable benefit/risk ratio. These results expand front-line treatment options for adult patients with previously untreated AML.

During this critical phase of pre-T-cell development, which is also known as the DN-DP transition, it is unclear whether the Notch1 transcriptional complex strengthens its signal output as a discrete unit or through cofactors. We previously showed that the protein inhibitor of activated STAT-like coactivator Zmiz1 is a context-dependent cofactor of Notch1 in T-cell leukemia. We also showed that withdrawal of Zmiz1 generated an early T-lineage progenitor (ETP) defect. Here, we show that this early defect seems inconsistent with loss-of-Notch1 function. In contrast, at the later pre-T-cell stage, withdrawal of Zmiz1 impaired the DN-DP transition by inhibiting proliferation, like withdrawal of Notch. In pre-T cells, but not ETPs, Zmiz1 cooperatively regulated Notch1 target genes Hes1, Lef1, and Myc. Enforced expression of either activated Notch1 or Myc partially rescued the Zmiz1-deficient DN-DP defect. We identified residues in the tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain of Zmiz1 that bind Notch1. Mutating only a single residue impaired the Zmiz1-Notch1 interaction, Myc induction, the DN-DP transition, and leukemic proliferation. Similar effects were seen using a dominant-negative TPR protein. Our studies identify stage-specific roles of Zmiz1. Zmiz1 is a context-specific cofactor for Notch1 during Notch/Myc-dependent thymocyte proliferation, whether normal or malignant. Finally, we highlight a vulnerability in leukemic cells that originated from a developmentally important Zmiz1-Notch1 interaction that is hijacked during transformation from normal pre-T cells.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Wang, Qing', 'Yan, Ran', 'Pinnell, Nancy', 'McCarter, Anna C', 'Oh, Yeonjoo', 'Liu, Yiran', 'Sha, Cher', 'Garber, Noah F', 'Chen, Yitong', 'Wu, Qingqing', 'Ku, Chia-Jui', 'Tran, Ivy', 'Serna Alarcon, Amparo', 'Kuick, Rork', 'Engel, James Douglas', 'Maillard, Ivan', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Chiang, Mark Y']","['Wang Q', 'Yan R', 'Pinnell N', 'McCarter AC', 'Oh Y', 'Liu Y', 'Sha C', 'Garber NF', 'Chen Y', 'Wu Q', 'Ku CJ', 'Tran I', 'Serna Alarcon A', 'Kuick R', 'Engel JD', 'Maillard I', 'Cierpicki T', 'Chiang MY']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2099-0956'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Watson School of Biological Sciences, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Cell and Molecular Biology Program, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH."", 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Life Sciences Institute and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Life Sciences Institute and.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and.', 'Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180803,United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Zimp10 protein, mouse)']",,"['Animals', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Thymus Gland/metabolism/*pathology']",PMC6148450,,,,2018/08/05 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2018/08/05 06:00'],"['2018/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/05 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)60744-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2018-02-835850 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2018 Sep 20;132(12):1279-1292. doi: 10.1182/blood-2018-02-835850.

We aimed to assess bi-directional associations between myeloid cancers and other cancers-ie, development of second primary cancer in patients who have previously had myeloid cancer, and risks of myeloid neoplasia in patients who have previously had another cancer-to provide insight into possible mechanisms beyond side-effects of treatment and shared risk factors. METHODS: Using the Swedish Family-Cancer Database, we identified 35 928 individuals with primary myeloid cancer, including myeloproliferative neoplasms, acute myeloid leukaemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome diagnosed between 1958 and 2015. The Swedish Family-Cancer Database includes every individual registered as a resident in Sweden starting in 1932, with full parental history. The primary endpoint was the assessment of relative risks (RRs) for second primary cancer, which we performed using means of incidence rate ratios, regressed over a generalised Poisson model. FINDINGS: Between 1958 and 2015, overall relative risk of second primary cancers was significantly increased after acute myeloid leukaemia (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.17-1.41), chronic myeloid leukaemia (1.52, 1.35-1.69), myelodysplastic syndrome (1.42, 1.26-1.59), and all myeloproliferative neoplasms (1.37, 1.30-1.43) relative to the incidence of these cancers as first primary cancer. With myeloid neoplasia as a second primary cancer, risks were significantly increased for acute myeloid leukaemia (1.57, 1.48-1.65), chronic myeloid leukaemia (1.26, 1.13-1.40), and myelodysplastic syndrome (1.54, 1.42-1.67) relative to the incidence of these myeloid neoplasms as first primary cancers. Relative risk of upper aerodigestive tract cancer, squamous cell skin cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma as second primary cancers were increased after all four types of myeloid neoplasia relative to their incidence as first primary cancers. High risks of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia as second primary cancers were found after haematological cancers (RRs between 5.08 and 10.04). INTERPRETATION: The relative risks of second primary cancer are important for the long-term management of patients with myeloid cancers. The bi-directional associations of myeloid cancers with many other cancers suggest a number of candidate mechanisms that might contribute to the development and aetiology of a second primary cancer. These mechanisms might include immune dysfunction or the effects of treatment, and these should be assessed in future investigations.

METHODS: A prospective, longitudinal, single-center study was conducted to assess the response to treatment with imatinib or nilotinib and the HRQoL profile of patients who were newly diagnosed with CML in chronic phase enrolled in the ENESTchina study. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were randomized to receive imatinib (n = 31) or nilotinib (n = 28). With a median follow-up of 5 years, there was no difference in HRQoL profile observed between patients receiving imatinib and nilotinib. Achieving optimal response at 12 months was associated with better role limitations due to physical health problems (RP; P = 0.0019) and emotional problems (RE; P = 0.0110) and was the sole factor associated with significantly improving physical component summary over time (PCS; P = 0.0160). Achieving optimal response at 6 months had high probability of better physical functioning (PF; P = 0.0674), better social functioning (SF; P = 0.0571), and reduced role limitations due to emotional problems (RE; P = 0.0916). In addition, factors including age < 40 years, female gender, and higher level of education were also associated with better HRQoL subscale scores. However, optimal response at 3 months had no impact on HRQoL profile. The proportions of patients with failure-free survival and PFS at 5 years were significantly higher among patients who achieved optimal response at 3, 6, or 12 months than among those who did not achieve optimal response (warning or failure), and the OS rate at 5 years was significantly higher among those who achieved optimal response at 12 months. In a multivariate analysis, treatment received (nilotinib vs imatinib) was identified as an independent factor for the achievement of optimal response at both 6 months (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.0-14.9) and 12 months (OR, 5.6; 95% CI, 1.7-17.9). CONCLUSIONS: Achieving optimal response at 12 months was not only associated with longer OS and reduced treatment failure rates and disease progression but also better HRQoL in newly diagnosed patients with CML-CP receiving front-line tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.

Instead of lasers and fluorophore tags, or magnets and magnetic particle tags, the technique uses ultrasound and microbubble tags. Streptavidin-labeled microbubbles were mixed with a human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, CCL 119, conjugated with biotinylated anti-CD7 antibodies. Tagged cells were forced under ultrasound, and their displacement and velocity quantified.

More recently a HAC assembled from a synthetic alphoid DNA array has been exploited in studies of centromeric chromatin and in assessing the impact of different epigenetic modifications on kinetochore structure and function in human cells. This HAC was termed the alphoid(tetO)-HAC, as the synthetic monomers each contained a tetO sequence in place of the CENP-B box that can be targeted specifically with tetR-fusion proteins. Studies in which the kinetochore chromatin of the alphoid(tetO)-HAC was specifically modified, revealed that heterochromatin is incompatible with centromere function and that centromeric transcription is important for centromere assembly and maintenance. In addition, the alphoid(tetO)-HAC was modified to carry large gene inserts that are expressed in target cells under conditions that recapitulate the physiological regulation of endogenous loci. Importantly, the phenotypes arising from stable gene expression can be reversed when cells are ""cured"" of the HAC by inactivating its kinetochore in proliferating cell populations, a feature that provides a control for phenotypic changes attributed to expression of HAC-encoded genes. Alphoid(tetO)-HAC-based technology has also been used to develop new drug screening and assessment strategies to manipulate the CIN phenotype in cancer cells.

MBL is divided into CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia)-like, atypical CLL-like and non-CLL MBL. The aim of this study was to evaluate immunophenotypic characteristics and clinical outcomes of MBL in kidney transplant (KT) recipients. We retrospectively evaluated 593 kidney transplant (KT) recipients in follow-up at our center. Among them, 157 patients underwent peripheral blood flow cytometry for different clinical indications. A 6-color panel flow cytometry was used to diagnose MBL. This condition was detected in 5 of 157 KT recipients. Immunophenotypic characterization of MBL showed four cases of non-CLL MBL and one case of CLL-like MBL. At presentation, median age was 65 years (range 61-73). After a median follow-up of 3.1 years (95%CI; 1.1-5) from diagnosis, patients did not progress either to CLL or to lymphoma. The disorder did not increase the risk of malignancy, severe infections, graft loss and mortality among our KT recipients. Surprisingly, all cases were also affected by concomitant monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which did not progress to multiple myeloma during follow-up. In conclusion, our data suggest that MBL is an age-related disorder, with non-CLL MBL being the most common subtype among KT recipients.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine chondrogenic ATDC5 cell model has been widely used for testing new osteoarthritis therapeutic targets. This study aimed to explore the effects of microRNA-136 (miR-136) on LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury and inflammatory cytokine expression, as well as underlying potential mechanism. We found that LPS remarkably inhibited ATDC5 cell viability, induced ATDC5 cell apoptosis, and upregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha; P < .01 or < .001). Moreover, LPS obviously upregulated the expression of miR-136 in ATDC5 cells (P < .05). Overexpression of miR-136 markedly exacerbated the LPS-induced ATDC5 cell viability inhibition, cell apoptosis enhancement, and inflammatory cytokine expression (P < .05), and suppression of miR-136 had opposite effects (P < .05). Myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1) was a direct target gene of miR-136, which participated in the effect of miR-136 on LPS-induced ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury. Overexpression of Mcl-1 alleviated the LPS-induced inactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling pathways, while suppression of Mcl-1 had opposite effects. To conclude, this study verified that miR-136 promoted LPS-induced ATDC5 cell injury and inflammatory cytokine expression by targeting Mcl-1, and Mcl-1 was involved in the regulatory effects of LPS on Wnt/beta-catenin and JAK/STAT signaling pathways in ATDC5 cells.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wang, Yang', 'Kong, Daliang']","['Wang Y', 'Kong D']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7106-2378'],"['Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.', 'Department of Orthopedics, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",20180803,United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chondrocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling pathway', '*Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway', '*lipopolysaccharide', '*microRNA-136', '*myeloid cell leukemia 1', '*osteoarthritis']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2019/10/11 06:00,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/11 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.27208 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2018 Nov;119(11):9316-9326. doi: 10.1002/jcb.27208.

This ongoing, open-label, phase 2 study (NCT01546038) evaluated glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin in patients with untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Patients received glasdegib 100 mg orally, once daily in continuous 28-day cycles from day -3, with intravenous cytarabine 100 mg/m(2) on days 1-7 and daunorubicin 60 mg/m(2) on days 1-3. Patients in remission then received consolidation therapy (2-4 cycles of cytarabine 1 g/m(2) twice daily on days 1, 3, 5 of each cycle), followed by maintenance glasdegib (maximum 6 cycles). Primary endpoint was complete remission (CR) in patients aged >/=55 years. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), safety and outcome by mutational status. Patients had a median (range) age of 64.0 (27-75) years, 60.0% were male, and 84.5% were white. In 69 evaluable patients, 46.4% (80% confidence interval [CI]: 38.7-54.1) achieved investigator-reported CR. Among patients >/=55 years old (n = 60), 40.0% (80% CI 31.9-48.1) achieved CR. Among all 69 patients, median OS was 14.9 (80% CI 13.4-19.3) months, with 12-month survival probability 66.6% (80% CI 58.5-73.4). The most common treatment-related adverse events (>/=50% patients) were diarrhea and nausea. There were no significant associations between mutational status (12 genes) and clinical response, suggesting potential benefit across diverse molecular profiles. Glasdegib plus cytarabine/daunorubicin was well tolerated and associated with clinical activity in patients with untreated AML or high-risk MDS.

However, recommendations are often non-specific and supported by low-quality evidence, resulting in divergent infection preventive regimens. Using a web-based survey, we investigated the infection prophylaxis guidelines of 22 paediatric AML study groups affiliated to the international Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster study group. In order to evaluate differences in daily practice among hospitals, representatives (n = 27) from the Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology-Dutch-Belgium-Hong Kong - AML study group participated in a slightly modified survey. Seven study groups (32%) advise gram-negative antibiotic prophylaxis, mainly with fluoroquinolones (n = 6). Gram-positive prophylaxis is prescribed by eight groups (36%). Over 60% of the study groups prescribe food and social restrictions, but the specific topics and strictness differ widely. According to the hospital-based survey, sites roughly comply with common study group guidelines. However, the use of any gram-negative antibiotic prophylaxis, the specific prophylactic antifungal agent and the strictness of the food and social restrictions differ substantially between the hospitals. Despite a long history of close collaboration, many differences are still present between the affiliated groups.

A total of 62 patients from Shenzhen People's Hospital were enrolled in this study. All patients enrolled received standard induction chemotherapy and achieved the first complete remission (CR1). In these patients, 24 received HiDAC and 38 received HAM as consolidation. The median relapse free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were similar between these two consolidation regimens. Even in subgroup analysis according to risk stratification, the combination regimen conferred no benefit in longterm outcome in patients with favorable or intermediate cytogenetics. However, in patients receiving HAM regimen, the lowest neutrophil count was lower, neutropenic period longer, neutropenic fever rate higher, and more platelet transfusion support was required. HAM group also tended to have higher rate of sepsis than HiDAC group.

The present study aimed to determine which subset of AML would be most responsive to low-dose cytarabine with the differentiating agent 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-D3). Here, firstly, cBioPortal database was used and we found out that vitamin D receptor (VDR) was highly expressed in acute monocytic leukemia (M5) and high VDR expression was associated with a poor survival of AML patients. Then, we confirmed that 1,25-D3 at clinical available concentration could induce more significant differentiation in acute monocytic leukemia cell lines (U937, MOLM-13, THP-1) and blasts from M5 patients than in non-monocytic cell lines (KGla and K562) and blasts from M2 patient. Finally, it was shown that the combination of 1,25-D3 and low-dose cytarabine further increased the differentiating rate, growth inhibition and G0/G1 arrest, while mild changes were found in the apoptosis in acute monocytic leukemia cell lines. Our study demonstrates that the enhanced response of acute monocytic leukemia cells to low-dose cytarabine by 1,25-D3 might indicate a novel therapeutic direction for patients with acute monocytic leukemia, especially for elderly and frail ones.",,"['Guo, Hao', 'Lin, Sheng-Yan', 'Ren, Wen-Xiang', 'Lei, Qian', 'Chen, Zhi-Chao', 'Zhang, Lu', 'Li, Qiu-Bai']","['Guo H', 'Lin SY', 'Ren WX', 'Lei Q', 'Chen ZC', 'Zhang L', 'Li QB']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, Key Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics of the Ministry of Education, College of Life Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. luluzhang103@hotmail.com.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430022, China. qiubaili@hust.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180315,China,Curr Med Sci,Current medical science,101729993,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Vitamins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '40013-87-4 (24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3)']",IM,"['24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Vitamins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3', 'acute monocytic leukemia', 'low-dose cytarabine', 'vitamin D receptor']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2018/08/04 06:01,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2017/11/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/04 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11596-018-1838-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s11596-018-1838-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Med Sci. 2018 Feb;38(1):35-42. doi: 10.1007/s11596-018-1838-9.

Phenotype-driver mutations in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), calreticulin (CALR), and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) genes are mutually exclusive and occur with a variable frequency. Driver mutations influence disease phenotype and prognosis. PV patients with JAK2 exon 14 mutation do not differ in number of thrombotic events, risk of leukemic and fibrotic transformation, and overall survival to those with JAK2 exon 12 mutation. Type 2-like CALR-mutated ET patients have lower risk of thrombosis if compared with those carrying JAK2 or type 1-like CALR mutation. For ET, overall survival is comparable between patients with JAK2 and either type 1-like and type 2-like CALR mutations. For MF, better OS is demonstrated for patients harboring a type 1-like CALR mutation than those with type 2-like CALR or JAK2. The discovery of driver mutations in MPNs has prompted the development of molecularly targeted therapy. Among JAK2 inhibitors, ruxolitinib (RUX) has been approved for (1) treatment of intermediate-2 and high-risk MF and (2) PV patients who are resistant to or intolerant to hydroxyurea.

Although acute complications were reduced during the last decade, considerable late effects are still limiting the overall success rate. This article emphasizes the specific pediatric aspects of long-term aftercare following myeloablative HSCT and provides an organ-based overview that covers main clinical patterns, incidence, and risk factors enhanced by current references and screening guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: In the last years, several attempts were made to separate pediatric outcome data from findings in adults. It turned out that not only the indication for but also the time and the procedures of HSCT substantially differ. Nearly any organ might be affected after the complex transplantation process and includes endocrinopathies, musculoskeletal disorders, cardiopulmonary complications, and secondary malignancies. Patients after HSCT in childhood have a high risk for developing a wide range of late sequelae and may benefit from regular screening and early intervention. The occurrence and patterns of late effects depend on the intensity and severity of conditioning and are strongly associated with patient's age at transplant and beginning of complications.",,"['Lawitschka, Anita', 'Peters, Christina']","['Lawitschka A', 'Peters C']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics University Vienna, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, 1090, Vienna, Austria. anita.lawitschka@stanna.at."", ""Department of Pediatrics University Vienna, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, 1090, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180803,United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],IM,"['Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*GVHD', '*Leukemia', '*Long-term effects', '*Pediatric myeloablative HSCT', '*TBI']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2019/11/09 06:00,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-018-0719-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-018-0719-5 [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2018 Aug 3;20(9):74. doi: 10.1007/s11912-018-0719-5.,9,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity can be of great value, especially for children. Silymarin has a potent antioxidant property that can be helpful in preventing cardio-toxicity. OBJECTIVE: 'To assess the possible protective role of silymarin against early doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in children with ALL'. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on 80 children with ALL, including 40 patients under doxorubicin therapy and silymarin 420 mg/day for one week after each doxorubicin dose starting from the day of doxorubicin infusion (Group I) and 40 patients under doxorubicin therapy and placebo (Group II). 'Conventional echo-Doppler measures of left ventricular systolic and diastolic functions and pulsed wave tissue Doppler of lateral mitral annulus were done for all patients'. RESULTS: After doxorubicin therapy, there was a significant higher reduction of systolic function [ejection fraction (EF), fraction shortening (FS) and s wave] in Group II compared with Group I and non-significant reduction of diastolic function [E/A ratio or e/a ratio] in both Groups. Although serum troponin increases in both groups after doxorubicin therapy, the increase of troponin is significantly lower in group I compared with group II. CONCLUSION: Silymarin decreased early Doxorubicin-induced left ventricular systolic function disturbances and can be recommended as an adjuvant drug in patients with ALL under doxorubicin therapy. RECOMMENDATION: 'Multicenter studies on a large number of patients with longer follow up' periods to prove the protective role of silymarin in early and late Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.","['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']","['Hagag, Adel A', 'El Shehaby, Walid A', 'El-Abasy, Aml I', 'Mabrouk, Maaly M']","['Hagag AA', 'El Shehaby WA', 'El-Abasy AI', 'Mabrouk MM']",,"['Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Pediatric Department, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.', 'Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Tanta University, Tanta, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United Arab Emirates,Infect Disord Drug Targets,Infectious disorders drug targets,101269158,"['0 (Cardiotonic Agents)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Troponin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cardiotonic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Doxorubicin/*adverse effects', 'Echocardiography, Doppler', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/diagnostic imaging/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Silymarin/*therapeutic use', 'Troponin/blood', 'Ventricular Function, Left/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Silymarin', 'cardiotoxicity', 'children', 'doxorubicin', 'leukemia', 'lymphoblastic.']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2017/09/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/04/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['IDDT-EPUB-92167 [pii]', '10.2174/1871526518666180803141827 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Disord Drug Targets. 2019;19(2):133-140. doi: 10.2174/1871526518666180803141827.,2,133-140,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well-established protocols produce robust ChIP-seq data for many proteins by sequencing the DNA obtained following immunoprecipitation of fragmented chromatin using a wide range of specific antibodies. In general, the quality of these data mainly depends on the specificity and avidity of the antibody used. However, even using optimal antibodies, ChIP-seq can become more challenging when the protein associates with chromatin via protein-protein interactions rather than directly binding DNA. An example of such a protein is the alpha-thalassaemia mental retardation X-linked (ATRX) protein; a chromatin remodeler that associates with the histone chaperone DAXX, in the deposition of the replication-independent histone variant H3.3 and plays an important role in maintaining chromatin integrity. Inherited mutations of ATRX cause syndromal mental retardation (ATR-X Syndrome) whereas acquired mutations are associated with myelodysplasia, acute myeloid leukemia (ATMDS syndrome), and a range of solid tumors. Therefore, high quality ChIP-seq data have been needed to analyze the genome-wide distribution of ATRX, to advance our understanding of its normal role and to comprehend how mutations contribute to human disease. Here, we describe an optimized ChIP-seq protocol for ATRX which can also be used to produce high quality data sets for other challenging proteins which are indirectly associated with DNA and complement the ChIP-seq toolkit for genome-wide analyses of histone chaperon complexes and associated chromatin remodelers. Although not a focus of this chapter, we will also provide some insight for the analysis of the large dataset generated by ChIP-seq. Even though this protocol has been fully optimized for ATRX, it should also provide guidance for efficient ChIP-seq analysis, using the appropriate antibodies, for other proteins interacting indirectly with DNA.",,"['Truch, Julia', 'Telenius, Jelena', 'Higgs, Douglas R', 'Gibbons, Richard J']","['Truch J', 'Telenius J', 'Higgs DR', 'Gibbons RJ']",,"['Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DS, UK. richard.gibbons@ndcls.ox.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (X-linked Nuclear Protein)']",IM,"['Chromatin Immunoprecipitation/*methods', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/*chemistry', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sonication', 'X-linked Nuclear Protein/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRX', '*Alpha-thalassaemia mental retardation X-linked', '*ChIP-seq', '*Chromatin immunoprecipitation', '*Chromatin remodeler', '*Double cross-linking', '*EGS', '*High-throughput DNA sequencing', '*Histone variant H3.3', '*Library preparation', '*NGS']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2019/04/09 06:00,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-8663-7_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2018;1832:105-130. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-8663-7_6.,,105-130,"['MC_U137961147/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_00016/3/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12009/3/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_UU_12025/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, TKI resistance remains a serious problem for patient prognosis. Here, a Ph+ ALL cell line NphA2 and the IMT-resistant subline NphA2/STIR were analyzed to identify a potential novel treatment strategy. We also examined other Ph+ ALL cells, MR87 and its IMT-resistant subline, MR87/STIR. IMT induced apoptosis of NphA2 and MR87 but had no effect on resistant sublines. Increased phosphorylated ERK and BCL2, but not BCL-XL, were observed in NphA2/STIR compared with NphA2. NphA2/STIR but not NphA2 was moderately sensitive to U0126, an ERK inhibitor. Interestingly, SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, was potent in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction of both parental and IMT-resistant NphA2 and MR87 cells. Moreover, NphA2 and MR87 and their IMT-resistant sublines were sensitive to ABT-199, a specific BCL2 inhibitor. The combination of SP600125 and ABT-199 synergistically suppressed both parental and IMT-resistant cells, including one with T315I mutation, suggesting that Ph+ ALL exhibits high sensitivity to ABT-199 and SP600125 regardless of TKI resistance.

Here, we studied the role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, and PKC in this process. We used THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, to investigate monocyte adhesion under static and flow conditions. We observed that 1.0 mug/mL LPS increased PI3K/mTORC2 pathway and PKC activity after 1 h of incubation. WYE-354 10(-6) M (mTORC2/mTORC1 inhibitor) and 10(-6) M wortmannin avoided monocyte adhesion in culture plates. In addition, WYE also blocked LPS-induced CD11a expression. Interestingly, rapamycin and WYE-354 blocked both LPS-induced monocyte adhesion in a cell monolayer and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, confirming mTORC1 involvement in this process. Once activated, PKC activates mTORC1/S6K pathway in a similar effect observed to LPS. Activation of the mTORC1/S6K pathway was attenuated by 10(-6) M U0126, an MEK/ERK inhibitor, and 10(-6) M calphostin C, a PKC inhibitor, indicating that the MEK/ERK/TSC2 axis acts as a mediator. In agreement, 80 nM PMA (a PKC activator) mimicked the effect of LPS on the activation of the MEK/ERK/TSC2/mTORC1/S6K pathway, monocyte adhesion to ECV cells and actin cytoskeleton rearrangement. Our findings show that LPS induces activation of mTOR complexes. This signaling pathway led to integrin expression and cytoskeleton rearrangement resulting in monocyte adhesion.

It has recently become apparent that the AML genome is characterized by recurrent mutations and dysregulations in epigenetic regulators. These mutations frequently occur before the onset of full blown leukemia, at the pre-leukemic phase, and persist in residual disease that remains after therapeutic intervention, thus suggesting that targeting the AML epigenome may help to eradicate minimal residual disease and prevent relapse. Within the AML epigenome, lysine-specific demethylase 1 A (LSD1) is a histone demethylase that is found frequently overexpressed, albeit not mutated, in AML. LSD1 is a required constituent of critical transcription repressor complexes like CoREST and nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD), and abrogation of LSD1 expression results in impaired self-renewal and proliferation, and increased differentiation and apoptosis in AML models and primary cells, particularly in AMLs with MLL- and AML1-rearrangements, or erythroid and megakaryoblastic differentiation block. On this basis, a number of LSD1 inhibitors have been developed in the past decade, and few of them are currently being tested in clinical trials for patients with AML, along with other malignancies. To date, the most promising application of this therapeutic strategy appears to be combination therapy of LSD1 inhibitors with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to reactivate myeloid differentiation in cells that are not spontaneously susceptible to ATRA treatment. In this review, we provide an overview of LSD1 function in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia, and of the current clinical application of LSD1 inhibitors for the treatment of patients with AML.",,"['Magliulo, Daniela', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Messina, Samantha']","['Magliulo D', 'Bernardi R', 'Messina S']",,"['Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Models of Cancers, Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical Models of Cancers, Division of Experimental Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Human Sciences, Society and Health, University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, Cassino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180719,Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,PMC6060236,['NOTNLM'],"['LSD1', 'LSD1 inhibitors', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'epigenetics', 'leukemia stem cells']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2018/08/04 06:01,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2018/03/27 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2018.00255 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2018 Jul 19;8:255. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2018.00255. eCollection 2018.,,255,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we aimed to uncover the mechanism of the lncRNA maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) and its target microRNA-147 (miR-147) in CML. METHODS: Sixty CML patients and 10 healthy donors were included in the study. The methylation of MEG3 and miR-147 promoter was determined by methylation-specific PCR. The relationship of MEG3 and miR-147 was explored by luciferase assay. The interactions of proteins were studied by RNA pull-down assay, RNA immunoprecipitation and co-immunoprecipitation. FINDINGS: Patients in accelerated phase CML (CML-AP) and blast phase CML (CML-BP) showed lower expressions of MEG3 and miR-147 and higher expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3B, MBD2, MECP2 and HDAC1 compared to the controls. These patients also showed a higher degree of methylation of MEG3 and miR-147 while there was a reduction after chidamide treatment. Furthermore, the overexpression of MEG3 and miR-147 inhibited cell proliferation both in vivo and in vitro, promoted apoptosis and decreased the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3A, DNMT3B, MBD2, HDAC1 and MECP2. We also found MEG3 interacted with DNMT1, JAK2, STAT3, HDAC1, and TYK2, and JAK2 was bound to STAT3, STAT5 and MYC. More interestingly, JAK2 was bound to TYK2 by the bridge of MEG3. INTERPRETATION: LncRNA MEG3 and its target miR-147 may serve as a novel therapeutic target for CML blast crisis, and chidamide might have a potential clinical application in treating CML blast crisis.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Author(s).

The Influence of CALGB 9343.,S1526-8209(18)30353-7 [pii] 10.1016/j.clbc.2018.07.004 [doi],"BACKGROUND: The Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 clinical trial proved that omission of radiotherapy (RT) in patients 70 and older with T1cN0M0, estrogen receptor-positive tumors who undergo breast conservation therapy (BCT) and receive 5 years of endocrine therapy (ET) had no change in overall survival, distant disease-free survival, or breast preservation. We examined our institution's practice with this patient subset. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-institution retrospective chart review was performed on patients 70 years and older with T1N0M0, estrogen receptor-positive tumors, and who underwent BCT between April 2010 and October 2015. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients met inclusion criteria: 46% received RT and 73% received ET. The ET group had a mean age of 76.2 years, whereas the non-ET group had a mean age of 80.2 years (P = .00006). Race did not influence if patients received ET (P = .4). In patients who received ET, mean age at time of diagnosis for those that completed 5 years of therapy was 75.5 years, whereas those who stopped therapy early had a mean age of 77.6 years (P = .053). In patients who received ET but stopped early, reasons for cessation included side-effect profile (67%), death (22%), and noncompliance (11%). Of the 27% of patients that did not receive ET, 62% were not offered therapy, 24% refused, and 14% were lost to postoperative follow-up. CONCLUSION: Increasing age showed significant association to not receive ET. Contraindication to ET and provider's assessment of minimal benefit are the most common reasons why patients are not prescribed ET. If patients are non-compliant with ET, RT should be reconsidered.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Molecular monitoring assists in the timely detection of primary or secondary resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy and is a recommended practice by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. An economic model was developed to estimate the potential impact of CML monitoring vs lack of monitoring on patient healthcare costs. METHODS: An Excel-based decision-analytic economic model was developed from a US payer perspective. The model was used to estimate the expected healthcare cost differences between regular molecular monitoring of CML patients and lack of monitoring. CML progression rates among patients with vs without monitoring, the annual cost of CML progression, the average number of monitoring tests per year, and the average cost per RT-qPCR monitoring test were incorporated into the model. Univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses were conducted. RESULTS: Based on estimates in published literature, disease progression to the accelerated/blast phase occurs among 0.35% of patients with monitoring and 5.12% of patients without monitoring, and the annual cost of CML progression is $136,308 per patient year. The analysis found that total healthcare costs, including the costs associated with CML progression and RT-qPCR monitoring tests (three tests per year), were $1,142 for patients with monitoring and $6,982 for patients without monitoring (difference = $5,840). In a hypothetical cohort of 100 patients with CML, achieving a 100% monitoring rate was associated with a total cost-savings of $584,005 compared to a 0% monitoring rate. This cost-savings remained consistent under both univariate and multivariable sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Regular CML monitoring was associated with improved outcomes among CML patients and, consequently, reduced healthcare costs.",,"['Jabbour, Elias J', 'Siegartel, Lisa R', 'Lin, Jay', 'Lingohr-Smith, Melissa', 'Menges, Brandy', 'Makenbaeva, Dinara']","['Jabbour EJ', 'Siegartel LR', 'Lin J', 'Lingohr-Smith M', 'Menges B', 'Makenbaeva D']",,"['a The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA.', 'b Bristol-Myers Squibb , Princeton , NJ , USA.', 'c Novosys Health , Green Brook , NJ , USA.', 'c Novosys Health , Green Brook , NJ , USA.', 'c Novosys Health , Green Brook , NJ , USA.', 'b Bristol-Myers Squibb , Princeton , NJ , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180815,England,J Med Econ,Journal of medical economics,9892255,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],IM,"['Blast Crisis/economics/physiopathology', 'Decision Support Techniques', 'Disease Progression', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Health Expenditures/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*economics/*physiopathology', 'Models, Economic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*economics', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'I10', 'I15', 'economic model', 'healthcare costs', 'molecular monitoring']",,2018/08/04 06:00,2019/01/15 06:00,['2018/08/04 06:00'],"['2018/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/15 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13696998.2018.1508023 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Econ. 2018 Oct;21(10):1036-1040. doi: 10.1080/13696998.2018.1508023.

We investigated idarubicin (IDR) resistance using exome nuclear DNA analyses of the human acute leukemia cell line MOLT-3 and the derived IDR-resistant cell line MOLT-3/IDR. We detected mutations in MOLT-3/IDR and MOLT-3 using both Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and SnpEff program. We found 8839 genes with specific mutations in MOLT-3/IDR and 1162 genes with accompanying amino acid mutations. The 1162 genes were identified by exome analysis of polymerase-related genes using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and, among these, we identified genes with amino acid changes. In resistant strains, LIG and helicase plurality genes showed amino-acid-related changes. An amino acid mutation was also confirmed in polymerase-associated genes. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment testing was performed, and lipid-related genes were selected from the results. Fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) was used to determine whether IDR permeability was significantly different in MOLT-3/IDR and MOLT-3. The results showed that an IDR concentration of 0.5 mug/mL resulted in slow permeability in MOLT-3/IDR.

Anti-proliferative activity of these structures was tested in vitro against a panel of five human cancer cell lines, including prostate (PC-3), colon (HT-29), leukemia (CCRF-CEM), lung (HTB-54) and breast (MCF-7). Four compounds (5, 6, 7 and 19) showed potent inhibitory activity with GI50 values below 10muM in at least one of the cancer cell lines. The selectivity of these compounds was further examined in two non-malignant cell lines derived from breast (184B5) and lung (BEAS-2B). Compound 7 exhibited promising anti-proliferative activity (GI50=3.7muM) in MCF-7cells, together with high selectivity index (SI>27.1). The induction of cell death by compound 7 was independent of the apoptotic process and it did not affect cell cycle progression either. Likewise, radical scavenging properties of the new selenadiazole derivatives were confirmed by testing their ability to scavenge DPPH radicals. Four compounds (1, 2, 8 and 9) showed potent radical scavenging activity, compound 9 being the most effective. Overall, while compound 7 was identified as the most cell growth inhibitory agent and selectively toxic to cancer cells, compound 9 proved to be the most potent antioxidant among the selenadiazole derivatives synthesized. This series of compounds can serve as an excellent scaffold to achieve new and potent antioxidant compounds useful for several diseases, i.e. cancer, neurodegenerative, heart diseases and leishmaniasis, considering the high radical scavenging activity and low toxicity showed by most of the compounds.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We detected DUXAP10 expression in 82 CML patients, 12 normal controls, and CML cell line by qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction). After transfection of si-DUXAP10 or si-PTEN in CML cell lines (K652, KG-1), we detected proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis by CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8), colony formation assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. Finally, protein expressions of p21, CDK2, Bcl-2, Bax, and PTEN were detected by Western blot. RESULTS: DUXAP10 was upregulated in CML tissues and cells, which was gradually increased in the chronic phase (CP), acceleration phase (AP), and blast phase (BP) of CML. Knockdown of DUXAP10 in K652 and KG-1 cells can remarkably inhibit cell proliferation, promote cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blot and flow cytometry results demonstrated that DUXAP10 can reduce apoptosis by inhibiting PTEN expression. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpressed DUXAP10 accelerates the development and progression of CML by promoting cell proliferation, reducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via inhibiting PTEN expression.",,"['Yao, R', 'Feng, W-T', 'Xu, L-J', 'Zhong, X-M', 'Liu, H', 'Sun, Y', 'Zhou, L-L']","['Yao R', 'Feng WT', 'Xu LJ', 'Zhong XM', 'Liu H', 'Sun Y', 'Zhou LL']",,"[""Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Huai'an No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China. bogy2004a@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2/metabolism', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/11/05 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201808_15632 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Aug;22(15):4934-4940. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201808_15632.,15,4934-4940,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, gene fusions as one important example of genetic aberrations leading to carcinogenesis follow the widely accepted concept that cell growth and proliferation are driven by the accomplished fusion (usually involving former proto-oncogenes) and may therefore be successfully inhibited by substances directed against the fusion. This concept has already been established with oncogenic gene fusions like BCR-ABL in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) in lung cancer, including special tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) which are able to block the activation of the depending downstream proliferation pathways and, consequently, tumor growth. During the last decade, the NTRK1, 2, and 3 genes, encoding the TRKA, B, and C proteins, have attracted increasing attention as another significant and targetable gene fusion in a variety of cancers. Several TRK inhibitors have been developed, and one of them, Larotrectinib (formerly known as LOXO-101), represents an orally available, selective inhibitor of the TRK receptor family that has already shown substantial clinical benefit in both pediatric and adult patients harboring an NTRK gene fusion over the last few years.",,"['Berger, Stephanie', 'Martens, Uwe M', 'Bochum, Sylvia']","['Berger S', 'Martens UM', 'Bochum S']",,"['Cancer Center Heilbronn-Franken, MOLIT Institute, SLK-Kliniken Heilbronn GmbH, Am Gesundbrunnen 20-26, 74078, Heilbronn, Germany. stephanie.berger@slk-kliniken.de.', 'Cancer Center Heilbronn-Franken, MOLIT Institute, SLK-Kliniken Heilbronn GmbH, Am Gesundbrunnen 20-26, 74078, Heilbronn, Germany.', 'Cancer Center Heilbronn-Franken, MOLIT Institute, SLK-Kliniken Heilbronn GmbH, Am Gesundbrunnen 20-26, 74078, Heilbronn, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",,Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

The lack of detailed knowledge about the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this cross-talk restricts the design of effective treatments. Guarnerio et al.

But the high dimension of these datasets makes the classification challenging due to the presence of many irrelevant and redundant features. Hence, feature selection becomes irreplaceable in this field because of its ability to remove the unrequired features from the system. As the task of selecting the optimal number of features is an NP-hard problem, hence, some meta-heuristic search technique helps to cope up with this problem. In this paper, we propose a 2-stage model for feature selection in microarray datasets. The ranking of the genes for the different filter methods are quite diverse and effectiveness of rankings is datasets dependent. First, we develop an ensemble of filter methods by considering the union and intersection of the top-n features of ReliefF, chi-square, and symmetrical uncertainty. This ensemble allows us to combine all the information of the three rankings together in a subset. In the next stage, we use genetic algorithm (GA) on the union and intersection to get the fine-tuned results, and union performs better than the latter. Our model has been shown to be classifier independent through the use of three classifiers-multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (K-NN). We have tested our model on five cancer datasets-colon, lung, leukemia, SRBCT, and prostate. Experimental results illustrate the superiority of our model in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

Increased levels of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate cause histone and DNA hypermethylation associated with blocked differentiation and tumorigenesis. In PDX mice transplanted with human IDH2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia cells, enasidenib treatment led to normalization of (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate serum levels, differentiation of leukemic blasts and increased survival. Early clinical data in patients with relapsed/refractory IDH2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia show that enasidenib is well tolerated and induces durable complete remissions as a single agent in about 20% of cases. One notable drug-related adverse effect is differentiation syndrome. On the basis of these results the compound has recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory IDH2-mutant acute myeloid leukemia in the USA.

Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) has a pivotal role in BCR signalling. Ibrutinib (PCI-32765) is a small molecule which serves as a covalent irreversible inhibitor of BTK. It is characterized by high selectivity for BTK and high potency. Ibrutinib is currently approved by the FDA and EMA for use in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in any line of treatment, for treatment of Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia in patients who have received previous treatments or are not suitable to receive immunochemotherapy as well as for second line treatment of mantle cell lymphoma and for patients with marginal zone lymphoma who have received at least one prior anti-CD20-based therapy. In addition, there is emerging clinical data on its efficacy in ABC subtype diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, multiple myeloma and primary central nervous system lymphoma. Ibrutinib has opened new options for treatment of those patients that have relapsed or have been refractory to more classical modes of treatment. Moreover, Ibrutinib has been shown to be effective in patients that have been known to have little sensitivity to classical immunochemotherapy. Having a favourable risk profile, the substance is, unlike conventional immunochemotherapy, also suitable for the less physical fit patients. Cases of primary and secondary resistance to Ibrutinib have emerged and there is an ongoing effort to identify their mechanism and develop strategies to overcome them. Beyond its direct effects on survival and apoptosis of malignant B-cells, there is increasing evidence that Ibrutinib is able to modulate the tumour microenvironment to overcome mechanisms of immune evasion. This has sparked interest in use of the substance beyond lymphoid malignancy. This chapter discusses structure, mechanism of action and toxicities of Ibrutinib and also presents important preclinical and clinical data as well as mechanisms of Ibrutinib resistance. Combination strategies with immunotherapeutic strategies such as immune checkpoint blockade and CAR T-cell therapy may be synergistic and are currently under investigation.",,"['Charalambous, Andriani', 'Schwarzbich, Mark-Alexander', 'Witzens-Harig, Mathias']","['Charalambous A', 'Schwarzbich MA', 'Witzens-Harig M']",,"['School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.', 'Barts Cancer Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Charterhouse Square, London, EC1M 6BQ, UK.

Due to occurring intolerance and resistance against the drug, the development of new inhibitors was promoted. This led to the second-generation inhibitors dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib. Despite all achieved improvements, first- and second-generation inhibitors are ineffective against the BCR-ABL T315I ""gatekeeper"" mutation. In order to overcome this issue and to further improve the inhibitory effect, the third-generation inhibitor ponatinib was developed. Various clinical trials have been launched to study the effect of ponatinib in the clinical setting. Based on positive phase 1 and phase 2 trials, ponatinib was approved for the second-line treatment of CML and Ph(+) ALL in December 2012 in the USA and in July 2013 in the European Union. The safety data of these trials particularly revealed a dose-dependent, increased risk for serious arterial occlusive events under treatment with ponatinib. Further trials investigate optimized dosing schemes to reduce side effects while maintaining clinical activity in CML and evaluate potential activity of the drug in other malignancies. In conclusion, ponatinib has proved to be a powerful BCR-ABL inhibitor, which exhibits clinical activity both in BCR-ABL wild-type and mutant CML, including the pan-resistant T315I mutation. Ponatinib should be used catiously with respect to increased cardiovascular risk. Despite previous TKI failure, chronic-phase CML patients can achieve sustained remissions using this drug, offering an important addition to therapeutic options in the treatment for CML.",,"['Wehrle, Julius', 'von Bubnoff, Nikolas']","['Wehrle J', 'von Bubnoff N']",,"['Department of Medicine I, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine I, Medical Center, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. nikolas.bubnoff@uniklinik-freiburg.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. nikolas.bubnoff@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

By its dual inhibition of Src and ABL kinase and also targeting further kinases, it creates a unique target portfolio which also explains its unique side effect profile. The approval of bosutinib in 2013 made the drug available for patients previously treated with one or more tyrosine kinase inhibitor(s) and for whom imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib are not considered appropriate treatment options. As initially the first-line clinical trial comparing bosutinib with imatinib in CML patients in chronic phase did not reach its primary endpoint and therefore the product was not licensed for first-line therapy, a second first-line trial, the so-called BFORE study, was performed and just recently the promising results have been published predicting a quick expansion of the existing label. In comparison with the other approved TKIs, bosutinib harbors a distinct side effect profile with only very few cardiovascular and thromboembolic events and minimal long-term safety issues with most adverse events happening during the first months of treatment. On the other hand, gastrointestinal side effects are very common (e.g., diarrhea rates in more than 80% of the patients) with bosutinib surprising some of the investigators during the early clinical trials evaluating bosutinib. Until then, several approaches have been used to face this problem resulting in extensive supportive efforts (such as early loperamid treatment) as well as new trials testing alternative dosing strategies with early dose adjustment schedules.

Dasatinib is approved for the treatment of CML (all phases) including children and for the treatment of Ph+ ALL, resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment. Randomized trials in CML comparing dasatinib with imatinib show that first-line dasatinib causes significantly deeper and faster molecular remissions. In accelerated and blastic phase CML, as well as in Ph+ ALL, dasatinib frequently induces complete hematologic and cytogenetic remissions even in imatinib pretreated patients. Remissions however are often short. Dasatinib is administered independent of food intake as a once-daily dose of 100 mg in chronic phase CML and 140 mg in Ph+ ALL or blastic phase.

They have a high selectivity against a specific molecular target known to be the cause for the establishment and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Imatinib is a rationally designed oral signal transduction inhibitor that specifically targets several protein tyrosine kinases, Abl, Arg (Abl-related gene), the stem cell factor receptor (c-KIT), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGF-R), and their oncogenic forms, most notably BCR-ABL. Imatinib has been shown to have remarkable clinical activity in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and malignant gastrointestinal stroma tumors (GIST) leading to its approval for treatment of these diseases. Treatment with imatinib is generally well tolerated with a low incidence of severe side effects. The most common adverse events include mild to moderate edema, muscle cramps, diarrhea, nausea, skin rashes, and myelosuppression. Several mechanisms of resistance have been identified. Clonal evolution, amplification, or overexpression of BCR-ABL as well as mutations in the catalytic domain, P-loop, and other mutations have been demonstrated to play a role in primary and secondary resistance to imatinib, respectively. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has led to the development of new second- and third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (see chapters on dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib).",,"['Waller, Cornelius F']",['Waller CF'],,"['Department of Haematology, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Faculty of Medicine, University Medical Centre Freiburg, University of Freiburg, Hugstetter Str. 55, 79106, Freiburg, Germany. cornelius.waller@uniklinik-freiburg.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Particularly in a younger patient, the therapeutic approach depends largely on diagnostic risk stratification, which has an impact on the outcome after therapy.

We studied 23 AML young patients, all treated with standard induction chemotherapy: OR (complete remission (CR) + CR incomplete (CRi)) was documented in 10 of 23 patients (44%); there were two partial responder patients. The optimal dBMA Treg cut-off value for predicting response to treatment (>/=21/muL) was obtained by ROC curve analysis. However, in multivariate analysis, apart from the expected impact of the molecular/cytogenetic risk (p = 0.049) and NPM mutation (p = 0.001), dBMA Tregs >/= 21/muL was not correlated with OR. Actually, higher dBMA Tregs were associated with the good intermediate molecular/cytogenetic risk group (p = 0.02), whose median OS was confirmed to be better as compared with that of the poor risk group (18 versus 5 months, p = 0.05) and equal to the dBMA Tregs >/= 21/muL group (5 versus 5 months, p = 0.902), respectively.

Here, we established a simultaneous and absolute quantification method for eight nucleoside triphosphates using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry and hydrophilic interaction chromatography. Our method was successfully applied to the extract of human acute myeloid leukemia Molm-13 cells. Results: Levels of ribonucleoside triphosphates (2.07 x 10(8)-2.29 x 10(9) molecules/cell) in Molm-13 cells were two orders of magnitude higher than those of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (1.72 x 10(6)-1.40 x 10(7) molecules/cell). Exposure of Molm-13 cells for 24 h to thymidine, a nucleotide imbalance inducer, increased the levels of cellular dTTP, dGTP, and dATP and decreased only dCTP, resulting in significant inhibition of cell proliferation. Conclusion: Our quantification method for nucleoside triphosphates revealed the quantitative relationship between the arrest of cell proliferation and the imbalance of nucleoside triphosphates in thymidine-treated Molm-13 cells. Owing to the short run time (15 min/run), broad adaptability, and throughput performance, we believe that our method is a powerful tool for not only genetic and molecular biology research but also for studying the mechanism of genotoxic compounds and anti-cancer or anti-virus drugs, drug screening, clinical studies, and other fields.",,"['Matsuda, Shun', 'Kasahara, Toshihiko']","['Matsuda S', 'Kasahara T']",,"['Safety Evaluation Center, Ecology & Quality Management Division, CSR Division, FUJIFILM Corporation, 210 Nakanuma, Minamiashigara, Kanagawa 250-0193 Japan.0000 0004 1770 2279grid.410862.9', 'Safety Evaluation Center, Ecology & Quality Management Division, CSR Division, FUJIFILM Corporation, 210 Nakanuma, Minamiashigara, Kanagawa 250-0193 Japan.0000 0004 1770 2279grid.410862.9']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180730,England,Genes Environ,Genes and environment : the official journal of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society,101285347,,,,PMC6065067,['NOTNLM'],"['Absolute quantification', 'Molm-13 cells', 'Multiple reaction monitoring/selected reaction monitoring (MRM/SRM)', 'Nucleoside triphosphates', 'Thymidine']","['Not applicable.The authors declare that they have no competing interests.Springer', 'Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and', 'institutional affiliations.']",2018/08/03 06:00,2018/08/03 06:01,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s41021-018-0101-8 [doi]', '101 [pii]']",epublish,Genes Environ. 2018 Jul 30;40:13. doi: 10.1186/s41021-018-0101-8. eCollection 2018.,,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the genes coding for the MYST family of KATs (KAT5-KAT8) are the oncogenes KAT6A (also known as MOZ) and KAT6B (also known as MORF and QKF)(2,3). KAT6A has essential roles in normal haematopoietic stem cells(4-6) and is the target of recurrent chromosomal translocations, causing acute myeloid leukaemia(7,8). Similarly, chromosomal translocations in KAT6B have been identified in diverse cancers(8). KAT6A suppresses cellular senescence through the regulation of suppressors of the CDKN2A locus(9,10), a function that requires its KAT activity(10). Loss of one allele of KAT6A extends the median survival of mice with MYC-induced lymphoma from 105 to 413 days(11). These findings suggest that inhibition of KAT6A and KAT6B may provide a therapeutic benefit in cancer. Here we present highly potent, selective inhibitors of KAT6A and KAT6B, denoted WM-8014 and WM-1119. Biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that these compounds are reversible competitors of acetyl coenzyme A and inhibit MYST-catalysed histone acetylation. WM-8014 and WM-1119 induce cell cycle exit and cellular senescence without causing DNA damage. Senescence is INK4A/ARF-dependent and is accompanied by changes in gene expression that are typical of loss of KAT6A function. WM-8014 potentiates oncogene-induced senescence in vitro and in a zebrafish model of hepatocellular carcinoma. WM-1119, which has increased bioavailability, arrests the progression of lymphoma in mice. We anticipate that this class of inhibitors will help to accelerate the development of therapeutics that target gene transcription regulated by histone acetylation.",,"['Baell, Jonathan B', 'Leaver, David J', 'Hermans, Stefan J', 'Kelly, Gemma L', 'Brennan, Margs S', 'Downer, Natalie L', 'Nguyen, Nghi', 'Wichmann, Johannes', 'McRae, Helen M', 'Yang, Yuqing', 'Cleary, Ben', 'Lagiakos, H Rachel', 'Mieruszynski, Stephen', 'Pacini, Guido', 'Vanyai, Hannah K', 'Bergamasco, Maria I', 'May, Rose E', 'Davey, Bethany K', 'Morgan, Kimberly J', 'Sealey, Andrew J', 'Wang, Beinan', 'Zamudio, Natasha', 'Wilcox, Stephen', 'Garnham, Alexandra L', 'Sheikh, Bilal N', 'Aubrey, Brandon J', 'Doggett, Karen', 'Chung, Matthew C', 'de Silva, Melanie', 'Bentley, John', 'Pilling, Pat', 'Hattarki, Meghan', 'Dolezal, Olan', 'Dennis, Matthew L', 'Falk, Hendrik', 'Ren, Bin', 'Charman, Susan A', 'White, Karen L', 'Rautela, Jai', 'Newbold, Andrea', 'Hawkins, Edwin D', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Huntington, Nicholas D', 'Peat, Thomas S', 'Heath, Joan K', 'Strasser, Andreas', 'Parker, Michael W', 'Smyth, Gordon K', 'Street, Ian P', 'Monahan, Brendon J', 'Voss, Anne K', 'Thomas, Tim']","['Baell JB', 'Leaver DJ', 'Hermans SJ', 'Kelly GL', 'Brennan MS', 'Downer NL', 'Nguyen N', 'Wichmann J', 'McRae HM', 'Yang Y', 'Cleary B', 'Lagiakos HR', 'Mieruszynski S', 'Pacini G', 'Vanyai HK', 'Bergamasco MI', 'May RE', 'Davey BK', 'Morgan KJ', 'Sealey AJ', 'Wang B', 'Zamudio N', 'Wilcox S', 'Garnham AL', 'Sheikh BN', 'Aubrey BJ', 'Doggett K', 'Chung MC', 'de Silva M', 'Bentley J', 'Pilling P', 'Hattarki M', 'Dolezal O', 'Dennis ML', 'Falk H', 'Ren B', 'Charman SA', 'White KL', 'Rautela J', 'Newbold A', 'Hawkins ED', 'Johnstone RW', 'Huntington ND', 'Peat TS', 'Heath JK', 'Strasser A', 'Parker MW', 'Smyth GK', 'Street IP', 'Monahan BJ', 'Voss AK', 'Thomas T']",,"['Medicinal Chemistry Theme, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.

Here we employed an integrated approach to selectively kill T-ALL cells by increasing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) using NS1619, a benzimidazolone that activates the K(+) (BK) channel, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), which blunts ROS scavenging through inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway. These compounds selectively killed T-ALL cell lines, patient-derived xenografts and primary cells from patients with refractory T-ALL, but did not kill normal human thymocytes. T-ALL cells treated with NS1619 and DHEA showed activation of the ROS-responsive transcription factor NRF2, indicating engagement of antioxidant pathways, as well as increased cleavage of OPA1, a mitochondrial protein that promotes mitochondrial fusion and regulates apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, transmission electron microscopy analysis indicated that NS1619 and DHEA increased mitochondrial fission. OPA1 cleavage and cell death were inhibited by ROS scavengers and by siRNA-mediated knockdown of the mitochondrial protease OMA1, indicating the engagement of a ROS-OMA1-OPA1 axis in T-ALL cells. Furthermore, NS1619 and DHEA sensitized T-ALL cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In vivo, the combination of dexamethasone and NS1619 significantly reduced the growth of a glucocorticoid-resistant patient-derived T-ALL xenograft. Taken together, our findings provide proof-of-principle for an integrated ROS-based pharmacological approach to target refractory T-ALL.",,"['Silic-Benussi, Micol', 'Scattolin, Gloria', 'Cavallari, Ilaria', 'Minuzzo, Sonia', 'Del Bianco, Paola', 'Francescato, Samuela', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Indraccolo, Stefano', ""D'Agostino, Donna M"", 'Ciminale, Vincenzo']","['Silic-Benussi M', 'Scattolin G', 'Cavallari I', 'Minuzzo S', 'Del Bianco P', 'Francescato S', 'Basso G', 'Indraccolo S', ""D'Agostino DM"", 'Ciminale V']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4784-3932', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6197-1802']","['Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Haemato-Oncology Division, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, via Giustiniani 3, 35128, Padova, Italy.', 'Haemato-Oncology Division, Department of Woman and Child Health, University of Padova, via Giustiniani 3, 35128, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, via Ugo Bassi 58/B, 35131, Padova, Italy.', 'Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV - IRCCS, Padua, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.', 'Department of Surgery, Oncology, and Gastroenterology, University of Padova, via Gattamelata 64, 35128, Padova, Italy. v.ciminale@unipd.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180801,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Mitochondrial Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '153587-01-0 (NS 1619)', '459AG36T1B (Dehydroepiandrosterone)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (molecule metalloprotease-related protein-1, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (OPA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Dehydroepiandrosterone/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Metalloendopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/metabolism/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Proteins/metabolism', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/chemistry/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",PMC6070521,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0870-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0870-9 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Aug 1;9(8):822. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0870-9.,8,822,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30069008,NLM,MEDLINE,20191203,20210311,2041-4889 (Electronic),9,2018 Aug 1,Screening for long noncoding RNAs associated with oral squamous cell carcinoma reveals the potentially oncogenic actions of DLEU1.,10.1038/s41419-018-0893-2 [doi],"Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have pivotal roles in human malignancies, although their significance in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is not fully understood. In the present study, we identified lncRNAs functionally associated with OSCC. By analyzing RNA-seq datasets obtained from primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), we identified 15 lncRNAs aberrantly expressed in cancer tissues. We then validated their expression in 18 OSCC cell lines using qRT-PCR and identified 6 lncRNAs frequently overexpressed in OSCC. Among those, we found that knocking down DLEU1 (deleted in lymphocytic leukemia 1) strongly suppressed OSCC cell proliferation. DLEU1 knockdown also suppressed migration, invasion, and xenograft formation by OSCC cells, which is suggestive of its oncogenic functionality. Microarray analysis revealed that DLEU1 knockdown significantly affects expression of a number of cancer-related genes in OSCC cells, including HAS3, CD44, and TP63, suggesting that DLEU1 regulates HA-CD44 signaling. Expression of DLEU1 was elevated in 71% of primary OSCC tissues, and high DLEU1 expression was associated with shorter overall survival of HNSCC patients. These data suggest that elevated DLEU1 expression contributes to OSCC development, and that DLEU1 may be a useful therapeutic target in OSCC.",,"['Nishiyama, Koyo', 'Maruyama, Reo', 'Niinuma, Takeshi', 'Kai, Masahiro', 'Kitajima, Hiroshi', 'Toyota, Mutsumi', 'Hatanaka, Yui', 'Igarashi, Tomohiro', 'Kobayashi, Jun-Ichi', 'Ogi, Kazuhiro', 'Dehari, Hironari', 'Miyazaki, Akihiro', 'Yorozu, Akira', 'Yamamoto, Eiichiro', 'Idogawa, Masashi', 'Sasaki, Yasushi', 'Sugai, Tamotsu', 'Tokino, Takashi', 'Hiratsuka, Hiroyoshi', 'Suzuki, Hiromu']","['Nishiyama K', 'Maruyama R', 'Niinuma T', 'Kai M', 'Kitajima H', 'Toyota M', 'Hatanaka Y', 'Igarashi T', 'Kobayashi JI', 'Ogi K', 'Dehari H', 'Miyazaki A', 'Yorozu A', 'Yamamoto E', 'Idogawa M', 'Sasaki Y', 'Sugai T', 'Tokino T', 'Hiratsuka H', 'Suzuki H']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8507-1726', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9635-3238']","['Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Project for Cancer Epigenomics, Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, 3-8-31, Ariake, Koto-ku, Tokyo, 135-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Science, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Science, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Diagnostic Pathology, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genome Science, Research Institute for Frontier Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan.', 'Department of Oral Surgery, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W16, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8543, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Biology, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, S1, W17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo, 060-8556, Japan. hsuzuki@sapmed.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180801,England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (DLEU1 lncRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mouth Neoplasms/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6070574,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-018-0893-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-018-0893-2 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2018 Aug 1;9(8):826. doi: 10.1038/s41419-018-0893-2.,8,826,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In rodents, LIF is expressed in both the fetal and adult testis; with the peritubular myoid (PTM) cells thought to be the main site of production. Given their anatomical location, LIF produced by PTM cells may act both on intratubular and interstitial cells to influence spermatogenesis and steroidogenesis respectively. Indeed, the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) is expressed in germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, PTM cells and testicular macrophages, suggesting that LIF signalling via LIFR may be a key paracrine regulator of testicular function. However, a precise role(s) for testicular LIFR-signalling in vivo has not been established. To this end, we generated and characterised the testicular phenotype of mice lacking LIFR either in germ cells, Sertoli cells or both, to identify a role for LIFR-signalling in testicular development/function. Our analyses reveal that LIFR is dispensable in germ cells for normal spermatogenesis. However, Sertoli cell LIFR ablation results in a degenerative phenotype, characterised by abnormal germ cell loss, sperm stasis, seminiferous tubule distention and subsequent atrophy of the seminiferous tubules.",,"['Curley, Michael', 'Milne, Laura', 'Smith, Sarah', 'Atanassova, Nina', 'Rebourcet, Diane', 'Darbey, Annalucia', 'Hadoke, Patrick W F', 'Wells, Sara', 'Smith, Lee B']","['Curley M', 'Milne L', 'Smith S', 'Atanassova N', 'Rebourcet D', 'Darbey A', 'Hadoke PWF', 'Wells S', 'Smith LB']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9032-3588'],"[""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", ""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", ""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", 'Institute of Experimental Morphology, Pathology and Anthropology with Museum, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113, Sofia, Bulgaria.', ""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", ""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", ""The British Heart Foundation Centre for Cardiovascular Science, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom."", 'Mary Lyons Centre, MRC Harwell, Harwell Campus, Oxfordshire, OX11 ORD, United Kingdom.', ""MRC Centre for Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, The Queen's Medical Research Institute, 47 Little France Crescent, Edinburgh, EH16 4TJ, United Kingdom. lee.smith@ed.ac.uk."", 'School of Environmental and Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia. lee.smith@ed.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180801,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/deficiency/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Sertoli Cells/*metabolism', '*Spermatogenesis', 'Testis/*physiology']",PMC6070476,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-30011-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-30011-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 1;8(1):11532. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-30011-w.,1,11532,"['MC_UP_1502/3/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/J01446X/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council', '(BBSRC)/International', '53658/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/N002970/1/Medical Research Council (MRC)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have demonstrated that miR-21, a microRNA extensively studied in the context of disease, is important in multiple facets of reproductive biology including folliculogenesis, ovulation, oocyte maturation and early mammalian development. Surprisingly, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate miR-21 and no studies have characterized these regulatory pathways in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). We therefore investigated miR-21 in an in vitro model of bovine oocyte maturation. Levels of the primary transcript of miR-21 (pri-miR-21) and mature miR-21 increased markedly in COCs over the maturation period. Cloning of the bovine pri-miR-21 gene and promoter by 5'3'RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) revealed a highly conserved region immediately upstream of the transcription start site and two alternatively-spliced variants of pri-miR-21. The promoter region contained several putative transcription factor binding sites, including two for signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Mutation of these sites significantly decreased both the intrinsic activity of pri-miR-21 promoter-luciferase constructs and the response to leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) (a STAT3 activator) in cultured MCF7 cells. In COCs, treatment with a STAT3 pathway inhibitor markedly decreased pri-miR-21 expression and prevented cumulus expansion. Pri-miR-21 expression was also inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, suggesting that a protein ligand or signaling cofactor synthesized during maturation is necessary for transcription. Together these studies represent the first investigation of signaling pathways that directly influence miR-21 expression in bovine oocytes and cumulus cells.",,"['Tscherner, Allison', 'Brown, Alyssa C', 'Stalker, Leanne', 'Kao, Jennifer', 'Dufort, Isabelle', 'Sirard, Marc-Andre', 'LaMarre, Jonathan']","['Tscherner A', 'Brown AC', 'Stalker L', 'Kao J', 'Dufort I', 'Sirard MA', 'LaMarre J']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada.', ""Centre de recherche en reproduction, developpement et sante intergenerationnelle, Faculte des sciences de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation, Departement des sciences animales, Pavillon des services, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."", ""Centre de recherche en reproduction, developpement et sante intergenerationnelle, Faculte des sciences de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation, Departement des sciences animales, Pavillon des services, Universite Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."", 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. jlamarre@uoguelph.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180801,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cumulus Cells/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis', 'Oocytes/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC6070548,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/10/18 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-29874-w [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-29874-w [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Aug 1;8(1):11527. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-29874-w.,1,11527,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to characterize CD30-positive cells and clarify their tumorigenic role in human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected cells.Experimental Design: CD30-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells from individuals with differing HTLV-1 disease status were characterized, and the role of CD30 signaling was examined using HTLV-1-infected cell lines and primary cells.Results: CD30-positive cells were detected in all samples examined, and the marker was coexpressed with both CD25 and CD4. This cell population expanded in accordance with disease progression. CD30-positive cells showed polylobation, with some possessing ""flower cell"" features, active cycling, and hyperploidy. CD30 stimulation of HTLV-1-infected cell lines induced these features and abnormal cell division, with polylobation found to be dependent on the activation of PI3K. The results thus link the expression of CD30, which serves as a marker for HTLV-1 disease status, to an active proliferating cell fraction featuring polylobation and chromosomal aberrations. In addition, brentuximab vedotin, an anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody conjugated with auristatin E, was found to reduce the CD30-positive cell fraction.Conclusions: Our results indicate that CD30-positive cells act as a reservoir for tumorigenic transformation and clonal expansion during HTLV-1 infection. The CD30-positive fraction may thus be a potential molecular target for those with differing HTLV-1 disease status. Clin Cancer Res; 24(21); 5445-57.

The recent in vitro finding that TLR-9 ligand (oligodeoxynucleotide [ODN]) and IL-15 exhibit strong synergy in promoting B-CLL growth may be particularly relevant to growth in these sites. This study shows IL-15-producing cells are prevalent within B-CLL-infiltrated lymph nodes and, using purified B-CLL cells from blood, investigates the mechanism for ODN and IL-15 synergy in driving B-CLL growth. ODN boosts baseline levels of phospho-RelA(S529) in B-CLL and promotes NF-kappaB-driven increases in IL15RA and IL2RB mRNA, followed by elevated IL-15Ralpha and IL-2/IL-15Rbeta (CD122) protein. IL-15-->CD122 signaling during a critical interval, 20 to 36-48 h following initial ODN exposure, is required for optimal induction of the cycling process. Furthermore, experiments with neutralizing anti-IL-15 and anti-CD122 mAbs indicate that clonal expansion requires continued IL-15/CD122 signaling during cycling. The latter is consistent with evidence of heightened IL2RB mRNA in the fraction of recently proliferated B-CLL cells within patient peripheral blood. Compromised ODN+IL-15 growth with limited cell density is consistent with a role for upregulated IL-15Ralpha in facilitating homotypic trans IL-15 signaling, although there may be other explanations. Together, the findings show that ODN and IL-15 elicit temporally distinct signals that function in a coordinated manner to drive B-CLL clonal expansion.","['Copyright (c) 2018 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']","['Gupta, Rashmi', 'Yan, Xiao J', 'Barrientos, Jacqueline', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Allen, Steven L', 'Rai, Kanti', 'Chiorazzi, Nicholas', 'Mongini, Patricia K A']","['Gupta R', 'Yan XJ', 'Barrientos J', 'Kolitz JE', 'Allen SL', 'Rai K', 'Chiorazzi N', 'Mongini PKA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5351-9223', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3717-5803', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2700-4784', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3482-3182', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5804-2823', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4966-7741']","['The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11303.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11303.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11303.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, North Shore University Hospital-Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11303.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030.', 'Department of Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549; and.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell, Hempstead, NY 11549.', 'The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, Northwell Health, Manhasset, NY 11030; patricia.mongini@nau.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180801,United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CPG-oligonucleotide)', '0 (IL15 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-15)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/*adverse effects/agonists/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects/immunology']",PMC6103916,,,,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/07/02 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/04/26 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1800591 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1800591 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2018 Sep 1;201(5):1570-1585. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1800591.

Studies conducted over the last several decades have yielded mixed results.Methods: We examined the association between allergy, a common immune-mediated disorder, and ALL in the California Childhood Leukemia Study (CCLS), a case-control study of 977 children diagnosed with ALL and 1,037 matched controls (1995-2015). History of allergies in the first year of life was obtained from interviews, mainly reported by mothers. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to estimate ORs and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for birth order, daycare attendance, and mode of delivery. In addition, we conducted meta-analyses with data from the CCLS and 12 published studies and employed a new method to estimate between-study heterogeneity (R_b).Results: Overall, no associations were observed between childhood ALL risk and specific allergy phenotypes or any allergy, as a group. However, having any allergy was associated with an increased risk of ALL among the youngest study participants. In the meta-analysis random-effects models, reduced odds of ALL were associated with hay fever (metaOR = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90); however, restricting the analysis to studies that used medical records for assessment of allergy or recently published studies led to null or attenuated results.Conclusions: Overall, our findings do not support a clear association between allergy and childhood ALL.Impact: The degree to which epidemiologic studies can inform the relationship between allergies and risk of childhood ALL is limited by R_b.

Several studies in solid tumors identified high expression of WEE1 kinase as a poor prognostic factor and reported its role as a cancer-conserving oncogene that protects cancer cells from DNA damage. Therefore, the targeted inhibition of WEE1 kinase has emerged as a rational strategy to sensitize cancer cells to antineoplastic compounds, which we evaluate in this study. METHODS: The effectiveness of the selective WEE1 inhibitor AZD-1775 as a single agent and in combination with different antineoplastic agents in B and T cell precursor ALL (B/T-ALL) was evaluated in vitro and ex vivo studies. The efficacy of the compound in terms of cytotoxicity, induction of apoptosis, and changes in gene and protein expression was assessed using different B/T-ALL cell lines and confirmed in primary ALL blasts. RESULTS: We showed that WEE1 was highly expressed in adult primary ALL bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts (n = 58) compared to normal mononuclear cells isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors (p = 0.004). Thus, we hypothesized that WEE1 could be a rational target in ALL, and its inhibition could enhance the cytotoxicity of conventional therapies used for ALL. We evaluated the efficacy of AZD-1775 as a single agent and in combination with several antineoplastic agents, and we elucidated its mechanisms of action. AZD-1775 reduced cell viability in B/T-ALL cell lines by disrupting the G2/M checkpoint and inducing apoptosis. These findings were confirmed in human primary ALL bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts (n = 15). In both cell lines and primary leukemic cells, AZD-1775 significantly enhanced the efficacy of several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as bosutinib, imatinib, and ponatinib, and of chemotherapeutic agents (clofarabine and doxorubicin) in terms of the reduction of cell viability, apoptosis induction, and inhibition of proliferation. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that WEE1 plays a role in ALL blast's survival and is a bona fide target for therapeutic intervention. These data support the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of AZD-1775 as chemo-sensitizer agent for the treatment of B/T-ALL.",,"['Ghelli Luserna Di Rora, Andrea', 'Beeharry, Neil', 'Imbrogno, Enrica', 'Ferrari, Anna', 'Robustelli, Valentina', 'Righi, Simona', 'Sabattini, Elena', 'Verga Falzacappa, Maria Vittoria', 'Ronchini, Chiara', 'Testoni, Nicoletta', 'Baldazzi, Carmen', 'Papayannidis, Cristina', 'Abbenante, Maria Chiara', 'Marconi, Giovanni', 'Paolini, Stefania', 'Parisi, Sarah', 'Sartor, Chiara', 'Fontana, Maria Chiara', 'De Matteis, Serena', 'Iacobucci, Ilaria', 'Pelicci, Pier Giuseppe', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Yen, Timothy J', 'Martinelli, Giovanni']","['Ghelli Luserna Di Rora A', 'Beeharry N', 'Imbrogno E', 'Ferrari A', 'Robustelli V', 'Righi S', 'Sabattini E', 'Verga Falzacappa MV', 'Ronchini C', 'Testoni N', 'Baldazzi C', 'Papayannidis C', 'Abbenante MC', 'Marconi G', 'Paolini S', 'Parisi S', 'Sartor C', 'Fontana MC', 'De Matteis S', 'Iacobucci I', 'Pelicci PG', 'Cavo M', 'Yen TJ', 'Martinelli G']",,"['Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. e A.

Hence, it is important to consider the differential diagnosis of a non-traumatic splenic rupture in patients with acute or insidious abdominal pain. The incidence of rupture in Diffuse B-cell non-Hodgkin Lymphoma is highly infrequent (Paulvannan and Pye, Int J Clin Pract 57:245-6, 2003; Gedik et el., World J Gastroenterol 14:6711-6716, 2008), despite reports of various non-traumatic splenic rupture in the literature (Orloff and Peksin, Int Abstr Surg 106:1-11, 1958; Paulvannan and Pye, Int J Clin Pract 57:245-6, 2003). In this article, we attempt to highlight the features of a rare cause of splenic rupture that might serve as a future reference point for the detection of similar cases during routine clinical practice. CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old man presented with 1 week history of left hypochondriac pain associated with abdominal distention. There was no history of preceding trauma or fever. Clinical examination revealed signs of tachycardia, pallor and splenomegaly. He had no evidence of peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease. In addition, haematological investigation showed anemia with leucocytosis and raised levels of lactate dehydrogenase enzyme. However, peripheral blood film revealed no evidence of any blast or atypical cells. In view of these findings, imaging via ultrasound and computed tomography of the abdomen was performed. The results of these imaging tests showed splenic collections that was suggestive of splenic rupture and hematoma. Patient underwent emergency splenectomy and the histopathological report confirmed the diagnosis as DLBCL. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of true spontaneous splenic rupture is uncommon. In a recent systematic review of 613 cases of splenic rupture, only 84 cases were secondary to hematological malignancy. Acute leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma were the most frequent causes of splenic rupture, followed by chronic and acute myelogeneous leukemias. At present, only a few cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have been reported. The morbidity and mortality rate is greatly increased when there is a delay in the diagnosis and intervention of splenic rupture cases. Hence, there should be an increased awareness amongst both physicians and surgeons that a non-traumatic splenic rupture could be the first clinical presentation of a DLBCL.",,"['Kaniappan, Kogulakrishnan', 'Lim, Christopher Thiam Seong', 'Chin, Pek Woon']","['Kaniappan K', 'Lim CTS', 'Chin PW']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3623-0484'],"['Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Enche Besar Hajjah Khalsom, Kluang, Johor, Malaysia.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400, Serdang, Malaysia. drchrislim@gmail.com.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Hospital Enche Besar Hajjah Khalsom, Kluang, Johor, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",20180802,England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,"['Adult', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', '*Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/complications/diagnostic imaging/surgery', 'Male', 'Splenic Rupture/etiology']",PMC6090959,['NOTNLM'],"['Lymphoma', ""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'Non-traumatic splenic rupture']",,2018/08/03 06:00,2019/01/16 06:00,['2018/08/03 06:00'],"['2017/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-018-4702-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-018-4702-1 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2018 Aug 2;18(1):779. doi: 10.1186/s12885-018-4702-1.,1,779,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However long term use of these drugs results in various adverse events. Treatment with second generation dasatinib is often complicated by hemorrhagic events. Previous lumi-aggregometry studies have shown impaired platelet function in patients on dasatinib therapy. Dual agonist activated platelets (coated-platelets) are also sensitive indicators of platelet function. We hypothesized that dual activation with convulxin and thrombin of platelets in a flow cytometric assay could be a more sensitive method for detecting platelet dysfunction as compared to single agonist studies used in lumi-aggregometer. Platelets of healthy volunteers incubated with dasatinib as well as platelets from patients on dasatinib therapy were investigated. Low therapeutic plasma level dasatinib concentrations at which a considerable reduction in coated-platelet generation was observed in vitro, did not cause detectable change in platelet aggregation response. Coated-platelet assay and lumi-aggregometry were also investigated at 0, 1 and 4 hours after drug administration in dasatinib treated CML patients. Significant decrease was observed at 1 hour in maximal aggregation by collagen. Although the aggregation curves became normalized by 4 hours, coated-platelet generation was still inhibited in dasatinib treated patients. Nilotinib, another second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had no effect on aggregation and on coated-platelet formation neither in vitro nor in ex vivo samples.

Recent studies emphasized the role of NK cells in the immune control of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a malignancy arising from hematopoietic stem cells, and the treatment of which has been revolutionized by the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Three major findings are emerging: 1) the impairment of the numbers and function of NK cells at diagnosis, 2) the restoration of the NK cell function and numbers during remissions induced with TKI therapies and 3) the potential role of the more mature NK CD56(dim) cell population in maintaining relapse-free survival after stopping TKI therapy.

An antiproliferative effect of pegylated arginase (BCT100) has been shown in acute myeloid leukaemia, hepatocellular carcinoma and mesothelioma. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of BCT100 in lung adenocarcinoma. A panel of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and xenograft models were used to investigate the effect of BCT100. Protein expression, arginine level, putrescine level, spermidine level and apoptosis were analyzed by western blotting, ELISA, high performance liquid chromatography, dot blot and TUNEL assay, respectively. BCT100 converts arginine to ornithine. BCT100 reduced in vitro cell viability across different lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and suppressed tumour growth in an HCC4006 xenograft, while paradoxical growth stimulation was observed in H358, HCC827, H1650 and H1975 xenografts. Upon BCT100 treatment, ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1) was induced in two solid tumour xenografts (H1650 and H1975). It was postulated that the accumulated ornithine could be channeled via ODC1 to produce polyamines that promoted tumour growth. The action of an ODC1 inhibitor (alphadifluoromethylornithine, DFMO) was studied in the restoration of the anticancer effects of BCT100 in lung adenocarcinoma. In both H1650 and H1975 xenografts, a combination of DFMO and BCT100 significantly suppressed tumour growth, resulting in doubled median survival compared with the control. Putrescine was decreased in almost all treatment arms in the H1650, H1975 and HCC4006 xenografts. Nonetheless spermidine was reduced only following DFMO/BCT100 treatment in the H1650 and H1975 xenografts. Apoptosis was enhanced in the combined treatment arm in both H1650 and H1975 xenografts. In the HCC4006 xenograft, addition of DFMO did not alter the tumour suppressive effect of BCT100. In conclusion, inhibition of ODC1 by DFMO was crucial in facilitating BCT100 treatment in lung adenocarcinoma that was partially mediated by depleting arginine and polyamines with consequent apoptosis.",,"['Lam, Sze-Kwan', 'U, Kin Pong', 'Li, Yuan-Yuan', 'Xu, Shi', 'Cheng, Paul Ning-Man', 'Ho, James Chung-Man']","['Lam SK', 'U KP', 'Li YY', 'Xu S', 'Cheng PN', 'Ho JC']",,"['Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, SAR, P.R.

The constitutive activation of Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling is an important feature of ATLL, and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) is overexpressed in HTLV1-transformed Tcell lines. In this study, we evaluated the effects of SYK- (PRT060318) or JAK- (JAK inhibitor 1) selective inhibitors and the dual SYK/JAK inhibitor, cerdulatinib, on the viability of HTLV1-transformed and ATLL-derived Tcell lines. Cell proliferation, viability, cell cycle, apoptosis and intracellular signaling cascades were analyzed by the water-soluble tetrazolium-8 assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. HTLV1-infected Tcell lines were sensitive to both SYK-selective and pan-JAK inhibitors, whereas cerdulatinib more potently suppressed cell proliferation and reduced cell viability than either of these agents alone. By contrast, the cytotoxic effects of cerdulatinib on uninfected Tcell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor were less pronounced. Cerdulatinib induced cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, which was associated with a decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 1 and cyclin B1, and an increased p21 and p27 expression. Hoechst staining revealed chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation in the cells treated with cerdulatinib, and an increased fraction of apoptotic APO2.7-stained cells was detected by flow cytometry. This corresponded to the activation of caspase-8, -9 and -3, and decreased levels of the anti-apoptotic factors, Bcl-xL, survivin, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) and cFLIP. The cerdulatinib-induced decrease in cell viability was partly reversed by the caspase inhibitor, zVADFMK. These anti-ATLL effects were associated with the suppression of SYK and JAK/STAT signaling, along with that of the downstream factors, AKT, ERK, activator protein1 and nuclear factor-kappaB. Finally, oral dosing with cerdulatinib lowered the tumor burden in a murine model of ATLL. Thus, our findings indicate that the simultaneous inhibition of therapeutically relevant targets, such as SYK and JAK is a more effective approach than single-agent therapy for the treatment of ATLL.",,"['Ishikawa, Chie', 'Senba, Masachika', 'Mori, Naoki']","['Ishikawa C', 'Senba M', 'Mori N']",,"['Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of The Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of The Ryukyus, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",20180801,Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,"['0 (2-(2-aminocyclohexylamino)-4-(m-tolylamino)pyrimidine-5-carboxamide)', '0 (2-tert-butyl-9-fluoro-3,6-dihydro-7H-benz(h)imidazo(4,5-f)isoquinoline-7-one)', '0', '(4-(cyclopropylamino)-2-((4-(4-(ethylsulfonyl)piperazin-1-yl)phenyl)amino)pyrimid', 'ine-5-carboxamide)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Cyclohexylamines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfones)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclohexylamines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/virology', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Mice, SCID', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyridones/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfones/*pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Syk Kinase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,,2018/08/02 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/08/02 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.2018.4513 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2018 Oct;53(4):1681-1690. doi: 10.3892/ijo.2018.4513.

Despite the tremendous achievements of state-of-the-art treatment strategies, drug resistance is still a major cause of chemotherapy failure leading to relapse in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The underlying mechanisms of such phenomenon are not yet clear and subject to further exploration. Prior research has shown that microRNAs can act as post-transcriptional regulators of many genes related to drug resistance. However, details of microRNA regulation mechanisms in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia are far from completely understood. METHODS: We utilized a computational approach based upon emerging biomedical and biological ontologies and semantic technologies to investigate the important roles of microRNA: mRNA regulation on glucocorticoid resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In particular, various filtering mechanisms were designed based on the user-provided MeSH term to narrow down the most promising microRNAs in an effective manner. RESULTS: During our manual search on background literature, we found a total of 18 candidate microRNAs that possibly regulate glucocorticoid resistance in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After the first-round filtering using the Broader-Match option where both the user-provided MeSH term and its direct parent term were utilized, the number of targets for 18 microRNAs was reduced from 232 to 74. During the second-round filtering with the Exact-Match option where only the MeSH term itself was utilized, the number of targets was further reduced to 19. Finally, we conducted semantic searches in the OmniSearch software tool on the five likely regulating microRNAs and identified two most likely microRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully identified two microRNAs, hsa-miR-142-3p and hsa-miR-17-5p, which are computationally predicted to closely relate to glucocorticoid resistance, thus potentially serving as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.",,"['Chen, Huiqin', 'Zhang, Dihua', 'Zhang, Guoping', 'Li, Xiaofeng', 'Liang, Ying', 'Kasukurthi, Mohan Vamsi', 'Li, Shengyu', 'Borchert, Glen M', 'Huang, Jingshan']","['Chen H', 'Zhang D', 'Zhang G', 'Li X', 'Liang Y', 'Kasukurthi MV', 'Li S', 'Borchert GM', 'Huang J']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', ""Department of Oncology, Yuebei People's Hospital, Shaoguan, Guangdong, China."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'School of Computing, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, 36688, USA.', 'School of Computing, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, 36688, USA.', 'College of Medicine, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, 36688, USA.', 'School of Computing, University of South Alabama, Mobile, AL, 36688, USA. huang@southalabama.edu.', 'College of Math and Computer Science, Fuzhou University, Fuzhou, Fujian, China. huang@southalabama.edu.', 'School of Information, Qilu University of Technology (Shandong Academy of Sciences), Jinan, Shandong, China. huang@southalabama.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180723,England,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,BMC medical informatics and decision making,101088682,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', 'Glucocorticoid Receptor Deficiency']",IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Glucocorticoids/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Information Storage and Retrieval', 'Male', 'Metabolism, Inborn Errors', 'MicroRNAs/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/deficiency', '*Semantics']",PMC6069764,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)', '*Biomedical and biological ontology (bio-ontology)', '*Drug resistance', '*Glucocorticoids (GC)', '*Semantic integration', '*Semantic search', '*miRNA target', '*microRNA (miRNA or miR)']",,2018/08/02 06:00,2019/06/30 06:00,['2018/08/02 06:00'],"['2018/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12911-018-0637-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12911-018-0637-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Inform Decis Mak. 2018 Jul 23;18(Suppl 2):57. doi: 10.1186/s12911-018-0637-3.,Suppl 2,57,['U01 CA180982/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Two hundred and eighty-six mature B cell neoplasms with flow cytometric analysis performed at the time of diagnosis were identified. Expression of CD13, CD45, CD19, CD20, CD5, CD10, CD38, CD22, CD23, FMC7, and kappa and lambda light chains was assessed for each case and correlated with clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: CD13 expression was associated specifically with cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) (16/26)- and FMC7-positive chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (11/30). No cases of follicular lymphoma (FL) expressed CD13 (0/48). Across all B cell neoplasms, CD13 expression positively correlated with FMC7 co-expression and kappa light chain restriction and negatively correlated with CD10 co-expression and lambda light chain restriction. No significant association of CD13 with overall or disease free survival in B cell neoplasms was seen. CONCLUSION: CD13 expression is present more often in LPL- and FMC7-positive CLL/SLL than other mature B cell lymphoma subtypes and absent in cases of FL and may be a useful feature for diagnostic subtyping.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Lau, Hubert', 'Nagy, Alexandra', 'Atwater, Susan K', 'Cascio, Michael J', 'Ohgami, Robert S']","['Lau H', 'Nagy A', 'Atwater SK', 'Cascio MJ', 'Ohgami RS']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5537-7740', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1881-3440']","['Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.', 'Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.', 'Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.', 'Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon.', 'Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",20180731,England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'CD13 Antigens/*blood', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*blood/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B cell lymphoma', 'CD13', 'flow cytometry']",,2018/08/02 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/08/02 06:00'],"['2018/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12909 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2018 Dec;40(6):715-720. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12909.

We aimed to assess the effect of lorazepam with granisetron on CINV in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: We reviewed the records of 71 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed ALL who received chemotherapy including vincristine, anthracycline, and systemic steroids between January 2011 and December 2016 in our hospital. The number of chemotherapy cycles reviewed was 164. All patients received granisetron as CINV prophylaxis. RESULTS: Nausea was observed in 51/71 patients (72%) and 93/164 cycles (57%). Vomiting was observed in 47/71 patients (66%) and 79/164 cycles (48%). Age and gender distribution were not significantly different between patients who received lorazepam at the initiation of the chemotherapy cycle (LZP group, n = 30) and those who did not receive lorazepam (non-LZP group, n = 134). There were no significant differences in the incidence of CIN and CIV between the LZP group and non-LZP group (CIN, 67% vs. 57%, P = 0.31; CIV, 53% vs. 47%, P = 0.98). In multivariate logistic regression, female gender and older age (> 5 years) were significant risk factors for CIV (female, odds ratio (OR) 2.5, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-5.0, P = 0.007; older age, OR 2.5, CI 1.3-4.8, P = 0.008).

Outcomes of CMML patients can vary from indolent disease with expected survival measured in years versus proliferative subtypes with rapid progression to acute myeloid leukemia and survival measured in months. Several prognostic scoring systems have been developed to risk stratify CMML patients. While all these models are valid, they demonstrate significant predictive heterogeneity. Significant intra-patient (applying different models in the same patient giving rise to different prognostic results) and intra-model (patients in a similar prognostic group by a given model can be reclassified to different risk groups by other models) heterogeneities exist when applying current CMML prognostic models in the clinic.

ENL is a histone acetylation reader and a critical component of the super elongation complex. ENL plays pivotal roles in the regulation of chromatin remodelling and gene expression of many important proto-oncogenes, such as Myc, Hox genes, via histone acetylation. Novel insights of the key role of the YEATS domain of ENL in the transcriptional control of leukemogenic gene expression has emerged from whole genome Crisp-cas9 studies in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this review, we have summarized what is currently known about the structure and function of the ENL molecule. We described the ENL's role in normal hematopoiesis, and leukemogenesis. We have also outlined the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of target gene expression by ENL, as well as its major interacting partners and complexes involved. Finally, we discuss the emerging knowledge of different approaches for the validation of ENL as a therapeutic target and the development of small-molecule inhibitors disrupting the YEATS reader pocket of ENL protein, which holds great promise for the treatment of AML.

Checkpoints within the cell division cycle that facilitate the accuracy and outcome of chromosome segregation are thus critical pathways for preserving chromosome integrity and preventing chromosomal instability. The spindle assembly checkpoint, the decatenation checkpoint and the post-mitotic tetraploidy checkpoint ensure the appropriate establishment of the spindle apparatus, block mitotic entry upon entanglement of chromosomes or prevent further progression of post-mitotic cells that display massive spindle defects. Most of our knowledge on these mechanisms originates from studies conducted in yeast, cancer cell lines and differentiated cells. Considering that in many instances cancer derives from transformed stem and progenitor cells, our knowledge on these checkpoints in these cells just started to emerge. With this review, we provide a general overview of the current knowledge of these checkpoints in embryonic as well as in adult stem and progenitor cells with a focus on the hematopoietic system and outline common mis-regulations of their function associated with cancer and leukemia. Most cancers are aging-associated diseases.

Relapse after allogeneic HCT is associated with a dismal prognosis and further therapeutic options are limited. One potential curative approach is a second allogeneic HCT. However, there is no consensus about optimal transplant modalities, suitable patients, and entities. We performed a retrospective analysis of our institutional database to evaluate risk factors that influence survival after a second allogeneic HCT for the treatment of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified 40 patients (AML, n = 29; ALL, n = 11) that received a second allogeneic HCT at our institution. At time of second HCT, 48% of patients were in complete remission (CR). Current overall survival (OS) was 14/40 patients with a median follow-up of 64 months (range 4-140) of patients alive resulting in a Kaplan-Meier estimated 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and OS of 32%, respectively. Cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse at 2 years was 31 and 37%, respectively. We identified several independent risk factors influencing OS: > 6 months from first to second transplant (p = 0.02), complete remission prior to transplant (p = 0.003), and the subsequent occurrence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (p = 0.003) were associated with a significantly improved OS.

Coilin is the marker structural protein of CBs. The expression level and cellular localization of coilin is sensitive to chemotherapeutic reagents, such as cisplatin. The gene of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (p27) is located with a high incidence translocation region of leukemic chromosomes, and its expression was of prognosis values in a variety of adult leukemia types. The exact profile and associated functions of coilin, as well as p27, in children's acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is obscure. Methods: Bone marrow samples from 144 patients with ALL were collected. The expression levels of coilin and p27 were detected by qRT-PCR. The patient cohort was divided into low and high groups of coilin and p27 respectively. The prognosis and clinicobiological characteristics of different groups were investigated, especially focused on the treatment outcome. Leukemia cells of Reh or RS4;11 were exposed to different concentrations of DNR, prior to the detection for morphological changes of coilin by immunofluorescence. In Reh cells, lentivirus sh-coilin was used to silence coilin expression. Western blotting was used to detect coilin and p27 expression; flow cytometry was used for cell cycle and apoptosis assay; MTS method was used for measuring cell viability to examine the drug sensitivity of DNR. Results: In this study, we found that daunorubicin was able to induce significant morphological changes of CBs in Reh and RS4;11 cells. Knockdown the expression of coilin increased the sensitivity to daunorubicin and inhibited the expression of p27 in Reh cells, and led to increased apoptosis. Importantly, not only the levels of coilin and p27 mRNA expression at initial diagnosis ALL children are markedly higher than those at complete remission (CR), but also both coilin and p27 expression in the relapsed patients was observed significantly higher comparing to the continuous CR patients. The 4-year EFS and RFS indicated that low levels of both coilin and p27 group favored better prognosis (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our results indicated that consideration of coilin and p27 levels could be a prognostic reference for predicting the outcome of pediatric ALL patients, especially for disease recurrence. Reduction of coilin expression was sufficient to increase the sensitivity of leukemic cells to daunorubicin treatments, and during which possibly involved functions of p27 in cell cycle regulation and its effects on cell apoptosis.",,"['Yue, Zhi-Xia', 'Gao, Rui-Qi', 'Gao, Chao', 'Liu, Shu-Guang', 'Zhao, Xiao-Xi', 'Xing, Tian-Yu', 'Niu, Jing', 'Li, Zhi-Gang', 'Zheng, Hu-Yong', 'Ding, Wei']","['Yue ZX', 'Gao RQ', 'Gao C', 'Liu SG', 'Zhao XX', 'Xing TY', 'Niu J', 'Li ZG', 'Zheng HY', 'Ding W']",,"['1Department of Medical Genetics and Developmental Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", '3Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f', ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", '3Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f', '4Beijing Key Laboratory for Tumor Invasion and Metastasis Research, Cancer Institute of Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f', ""Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children (Capital Medical University), Ministry of Education, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, Hematology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100045 China."", ""Beijing Key Laboratory of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, National Key Discipline of Pediatrics, Ministry of Education, MOE Key Laboratory of Major Diseases in Children, Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, National Center for Children's Health, Beijing, 100045 China."", '3Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f', '4Beijing Key Laboratory for Tumor Invasion and Metastasis Research, Cancer Institute of Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069 China.0000 0004 0369 153Xgrid.24696.3f']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180727,England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,PMC6062948,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Chemotherapy', 'Coilin', 'Pediatrics', 'Relapse', 'p27']",,2018/08/02 06:00,2018/08/02 06:01,['2018/08/02 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/02 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-018-0600-5 [doi]', '600 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2018 Jul 27;18:106. doi: 10.1186/s12935-018-0600-5. eCollection 2018.,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms by which WT1 mutations contribute to leukemogenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated the role of Wt1 gene dosage in steady-state and pathologic hematopoiesis. Wt1 heterozygous loss enhanced stem cell self-renewal in an age-dependent manner, which increased stem cell function over time and resulted in age-dependent leukemic transformation. Wt1-haploinsufficient leukemias were characterized by progressive genetic and epigenetic alterations, including those in known leukemia-associated alleles, demonstrating a requirement for additional events to promote hematopoietic transformation. Consistent with this observation, we found that Wt1 depletion cooperates with Flt3-ITD mutation to induce fully penetrant AML. Our studies provide insight into mechanisms of Wt1-loss leukemogenesis and into the evolutionary events required to induce transformation of Wt1-haploinsufficient stem/progenitor cells.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Pronier, Elodie', 'Bowman, Robert L', 'Ahn, Jihae', 'Glass, Jacob', 'Kandoth, Cyriac', 'Merlinsky, Tiffany R', 'Whitfield, Justin T', 'Durham, Benjamin H', 'Gruet, Antoine', 'Hanasoge Somasundara, Amritha Varshini', 'Rampal, Raajit', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Koche, Richard P', 'Taylor, Barry S', 'Levine, Ross L']","['Pronier E', 'Bowman RL', 'Ahn J', 'Glass J', 'Kandoth C', 'Merlinsky TR', 'Whitfield JT', 'Durham BH', 'Gruet A', 'Hanasoge Somasundara AV', 'Rampal R', 'Melnick A', 'Koche RP', 'Taylor BS', 'Levine RL']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9411-0873'],"['Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research.', 'Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program.', 'Center for Epigenetics Research.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and.', 'Marie-Josee and Henry R.

The findings, immediate safety and longer-term outcomes of pericardiocentesis are less well defined. We reviewed the cases of all patients with malignancy that underwent pericardiocentesis at our institution over a 10-year period. From January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2016, 171 patients with cancer underwent echo-guided pericardiocentesis. A total of 53% were male with a mean age of 60 +/- 15 years. The average volume drained was 485 (IQR 350 to 719) ml. The procedure was technically successful in 170/171 (99.4%) of patients without significant complications; there were no procedure-related deaths. A total of 20% had hemorrhagic, 48% had serosanguinous, and 31% serous pericardial effusions. The type of effusion was not associated with outcome. Cytology (measured in 164) was positive in 58% and only weakly related to outcome (median survival nine versus 18 weeks, p=0.04). Per our institutional practice, a pericardial catheter was left in place until there were less than 50 ml of net drainage in 24 hours (average 3 +/- 2 days). A total of 135 patients had metastatic carcinoma, 23 patients had lymphoma or chronic leukemia and 4 metastatic sarcoma. Patients with either lymphoma or chronic leukemia had better survival than those with carcinoma or sarcoma (median survival 102 vs 12 weeks, p < 0.0001) with a 46% vs 3% 5-year survival, p < 0.0001). Echoguided pericardiocentesis with extended pericardial catheter placement is safe and effective in cancer patients with pericardial effusions. However, overall outcomes are poor in cancer patients with pericardial effusions that required drainage, particularly in those with carcinoma or sarcoma.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, there has been no valid immune biomarker to predict the prognosis of untreated CLL patients. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, we analyzed the clinical correlations and prognostic value of albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio (AFR) detected at diagnosis in 191 CLL patients. RESULTS: The cut-off value of AFR was 9.7 calculated by X-tile. Patients who were more than 65 years old were often accompanied by low level of AFR (p < 0.001). Survival analysis showed that patients with low level of AFR had shorter overall survival (OS) than patients with high level of AFR (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis illustrated that AFR had a negative impact on OS (p=0.003) and was independent of parameters involved in CLL international prognostic index and other prognostic markers such as CD38 and ZAP-70. CONCLUSION: These data provide a comprehensive view of AFR and shows that AFR at diagnosis is an adverse prognostic factor in untreated CLL patients.",,"['Zou, Yi-Xin', 'Qiao, Jia', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan',

As decitabine (DAC) is known to be effective also in AML/MDS with leukocytosis, we investigated the combination of DAC with DLIs for relapse after allo-HCT. Between 2006 and 2016, 26 patients (median age 59 years) with AML (n=18), MDS (n=6), or MPN (n=2) and overt hematological relapse after allo-HCT were treated. Median duration from allo-HCT to relapse was 306 days (range, 76-4943). Eighteen patients received DAC+DLIs, 8 DAC-only (median number cycles of DAC: 2, range 1-13, median number of DLIs: 2, range 1-10). The incidence of acute and chronic GvHD in patients receiving DLI was 17% (3/18) and 6% (1/18), respectively. CR/CRi was achieved in 15% (4/26), PR in 4% (1/26), and stable disease in 58% (15/26) of patients. Eight patients received a second allo-HCT. Median overall survival was 4.7 months. Elevated PD-L1 protein expression in bone marrow cells was detected in 4/8 patients with >20% blast infiltration prior to DAC, without a clear association with response.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) can be used as a frontline consolidation treatment to prevent the relapse of advanced disease or as salvage treatment after chemotherapy for relapsed sensitive disease. We retrospectively analyzed 36 patients (ENKTL, n=26; ANKL, n=10) who underwent upfront (n=19) and salvage allogeneic SCT (n=17) at 6 hospitals. Patients received myeloablative (n=25) or reduced-intensity (n =11) conditioning regimens depending on the institute's policy. The median age at the time of allogeneic SCT was 37 years (range, 17 to 62), and more patients with ANKL (8/10) received upfront allogeneic SCT than ENKTL patients (11/26). Disease status before allogeneic SCT, conditioning regimen, and donor source did not differ between upfront and salvage allogeneic SCT groups. Febrile neutropenia (n=20) and acute graft-versus-host disease (n=16) were common adverse events. The median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after allogeneic SCT were 11.8 months and 10.0 months, respectively. Twelve patients died from disease relapse and 12 from nondisease-related causes. Ten deaths occurred within 100 days after allogeneic SCT (10/24); these were mostly related to disease relapse (n=8). The OS after allogeneic SCT did not differ between ENKTL and ANKL (P=.550) or between upfront and salvage SCT (P=.862). Complete chimerism was significantly associated with better PFS (P < .001). No significant differences in PFS were observed based on the conditioning regimen or source of stem cells (P > .05). Allogeneic SCT may be beneficial for patients with ENKTL and ANKL given that some patients were able to maintain their remission after allogeneic SCT. However, allogeneic SCT should only be performed in highly selected patients because the risks of disease relapse and nondisease-related mortality remain high.","['Copyright (c) 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Published by Elsevier Inc.

Engagement of NKG2D receptor on NK cells enhances the target cytotoxicity. Here, we produced a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of the NKG2D ligand MICA and the anti-CD20 single-chain variable fragment (scfv). This recombinant protein is capable of binding both NK cells and CD20(+) tumor cells. Using a human NKG2D reporter cell system we developed, we showed that this fusion protein could decorate CD20(+) tumor cells with MICA extracellular domain and activate NK through NKG2D. We further demonstrated that this protein could specifically induce the ability of a NK cell line (NKL) and primary NK cells to lyse CD20(+) leukemia cells. Moreover, we found that downregulation of surface HLA class I expression in the target cells improved NKL-mediated killing. Our results demonstrated that this recombinant protein specifically lyses leukemia cells by NK cells, which may lead to development of a novel strategy for treating leukemia and other tumors.","['(c) 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This condition may cause significant systemic anomalies such as malnutrition, opportunistic infections, and delay in the chemotherapy course. This report aims to describe a case series of 11 ALL patients treated with methotrexate as chemotherapy agent.

Then, the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and the International Society of Oral Oncology (MASCC/ISOO) management protocol for OM was applied to them. The mean time of the lesion total resolution was 3.7 days. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to emphasise the importance of early detection of OM through a close clinical oral examination of children and adolescents with ALL undergoing methotrexate chemotherapy. Pain/infection control and the maintenance of good levels of oral hygiene are fundamental during the management of OM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of 120 paediatric leukaemic patients (age below 15 years) in the UAE were reviewed for the occurrence of oral health problems. Records from the three main hospitals that provide cancer therapy were accessed after obtaining the required permissions. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of oral health problems in leukaemic patients in our study is 60%. The most common oral health problem recorded in the patients&#x26;#x2019; records was oral mucositis and ulceration (52.4%) followed by dental caries and oral candidiasis accounting for 18.3% and 14.2% respectively. Other oral health problems recorded were gingivitis and gingival bleeding, herpetic gingivostomatitis, poor oral hygiene, and facial palsy. The peak occurrence of most oral problems was during phase IV (maintenance). Oral health problems were more common among patients who received treatment and follow-up locally rather than abroad. STATISTICS: Collected data were analysed using statistical software International Business Machines (IBM) Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS, version 20, Chicago, SPSS Inc). Descriptive statistics were performed to describe the characteristics of the study population. The association between oral health problems and other risk factors was analysed using the Chi-squared test. A P-value of &#x26;#x3C;0.05 was considered statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to describe oral health problems and its correlation to the phase of chemotherapy in leukaemic paediatric patients in the UAE. Oral health problems as a result of leukaemia and its management are both variable and unavoidable. Therefore, oral and dental care is of critical importance in maintaining the overall wellbeing of the patient before, during, and after treatment.

Virtual screening and similarity search in combination with bioactivity assay lead to the identification of the natural compound radicicol as a potent FTO inhibitor, which exhibits a dose-dependent inhibition of FTO demethylation activity with an IC50 value of 16.04 muM. Further ITC experiments show that the binding between radicicol and FTO was mainly entropy-driven. Crystal structure analysis reveals that radicicol adopts an L-shaped conformation in the FTO binding site and occupies the same position as N-CDPCB, a previously identified small molecular inhibitor of FTO. Unexpectedly, however, the 1,3-diol group conserved in radicicol and N-CDPCB assumes strikingly different orientations for interaction with FTO. The identification of radicicol as an FTO inhibitor and revelation of its recognition mechanism not only opens the possibility of developing new therapeutic strategies for treatment of leukemia but also provide clues for elucidation of the acting mechanisms of radicicol, which is a possible clinical candidate worth in-depth study.",,"['Wang, Ruiyong', 'Han, Zhifu', 'Liu, Bingjie', 'Zhou, Bin', 'Wang, Ning', 'Jiang, Qingwei', 'Qiao, Yan', 'Song, Chuanjun', 'Chai, Jijie', 'Chang, Junbiao']","['Wang R', 'Han Z', 'Liu B', 'Zhou B', 'Wang N', 'Jiang Q', 'Qiao Y', 'Song C', 'Chai J', 'Chang J']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6357-8203', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7733-578X']","['School of Life Sciences , Tsinghua University , and Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084 , China.', 'College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Henan Normal University , Xinxiang 453007 , China.', 'School of Life Sciences , Tsinghua University , and Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084 , China.', 'School of Life Sciences , Tsinghua University , and Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, Beijing 100084 , China.', 'College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering , Henan Normal University , Xinxiang 453007 , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180814,United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Macrolides)', 'EC 1.14.11.33 (Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO)', 'I60EH8GECX (monorden)']",,"['Alpha-Ketoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenase FTO/*antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Calorimetry', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Macrolides/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*FTO', '*inhibitor', '*radicicol']",,2018/08/01 06:00,2019/08/03 06:00,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00522 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2018 Sep 4;15(9):4092-4098. doi: 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.8b00522.

The aim of this study was to characterize the population pharmacokinetics of gemtuzumab ozogamicin, represented by total hP67.6 antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin, in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia to support drug dosing strategies and explore intrinsic and extrinsic factors that may influence exposure. Pharmacokinetic data from seven previous phase I and II studies in adult patients with relapsed, refractory, or de novo acute myeloid leukemia were integrated and analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. METHODS: The pharmacokinetics of total hP67.6 antibody was described in 407 patients (5643 concentrations) who received gemtuzumab ozogamicin doses ranging from 0.25 to 9 mg/m(2) using a two-compartment model with linear and time-dependent clearance components. The pharmacokinetics of unconjugated calicheamicin was characterized in 338 patients (4281 concentrations) using a two-compartment model with an input rate of formation dependent on the amount of hP67.6 eliminated. No statistically significant baseline covariates (sex, albumin, bone marrow, and peripheral blast percentage) demonstrated a clinically meaningful impact. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Total hP67.6 antibody disposition did not appear altered in patients with mild or moderate renal disease or hepatic impairment. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin was approved for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by the US Food and Drug Administration in September 2017. The model-based simulations described here provided a pharmacokinetic rationale for the approved dosing regimen of 3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, and 7, and served as the basis for all exposure-response modeling included in the recent Biologics License Application submission.

Ibrutinib is associated with atrial fibrillation and bleeding events. Our aim is to determine the management of prior atrial fibrillation when starting ibrutinib, as well as ibrutinib-induced atrial fibrillation. Our focus is on which rate and rhythm control strategies to use and decisions regarding the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents. Materials and Methods We conducted a retrospective descriptive study of case records over a three-year period from February 2014 to February 2017. We reviewed 597 patient charts from the Cleveland Clinic database. Ibrutinib was started in 43 patients. Of those, 10 had atrial fibrillation prior to starting ibrutinib and four developed atrial fibrillation while on ibrutinib. Data was collected for demographic details, co-morbid conditions, CHA2DS2-VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke, transient ischemic attack or thromboembolism, vascular disease, age, and sex category) score, HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal and liver function, stroke, bleeding, labile INR, elderly, and drugs or alcohol) score, and drugs used for antiplatelet effects, for anticoagulation, and for rate and rhythm control. Outcomes for embolic and bleeding events were assessed. Results Of the 43 patients, 14 (32.5%) had or developed atrial fibrillation; 10 (23.26%) had prior atrial fibrillation, and four (9.30%) developed atrial fibrillation after starting ibrutinib. The majority were males (71.42%) and Caucasian (71.42%). The disease breakdown was chronic lymphocytic leukemia (42.86%), mantle cell lymphoma (50%), and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (7.14%). The mean starting dose of ibrutinib in patients with prior atrial fibrillation was 569 mg and for patients who developed atrial fibrillation was 420 mg. In the 10 patients who had atrial fibrillation prior to ibrutinib, all 10 were on beta blockers, one was on diltiazem, three were on amiodarone, one was on flecainide, one was on digoxin, and one was on Tikosyn(R) (Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY). The ibrutinib dose was decreased/discontinued in two patients. In patients who developed atrial fibrillation after starting ibrutinib, three were on beta blockers, two on amiodarone, and one on Tikosyn. Ibrutinib was discontinued in one patient. In patients who had prior atrial fibrillation, three were on warfarin, one on enoxaparin, and two on apixaban. In three patients, aspirin and enoxaparin were discontinued. In patients who developed atrial fibrillation after starting ibrutinib, enoxaparin was given to two and apixaban to one. None of the patients had a stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or bleeding events. Conclusions From our study, we concluded that ibrutinib can be safely given in the presence of atrial fibrillation, and when atrial fibrillation was induced, we further concluded that beta blockers were the preferred agents for rate control. Ibrutinib has many drug interactions with other rate and rhythm control agents; hence, their use was lower. When atrial fibrillation was uncontrolled, ibrutinib was temporarily held and then cautiously restarted. The decision to start or adjust anticoagulation depended on the bleeding and stroke risks as assessed by their physicians.",,"['Khalid, Sidra', 'Yasar, Samin', 'Khalid, Aariez', 'Spiro, Timothy Pp', 'Haddad, Abdo', 'Daw, Hamed']","['Khalid S', 'Yasar S', 'Khalid A', 'Spiro TP', 'Haddad A', 'Daw H']",,"['Internal Medicine Residency, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Internal Medicine, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Biomedical Science, University of Guelph, Guelph, CAN.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Fairview Hospital, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180529,United States,Cureus,Cureus,101596737,,,,PMC6063389,['NOTNLM'],"['anticoagulation', 'atrial fibrillation', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'ibrutinib', 'mantle cell lymphoma', 'rate control', 'rhythm control', ""waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia""]",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2018/08/01 06:00,2018/08/01 06:01,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.7759/cureus.2701 [doi]'],epublish,Cureus. 2018 May 29;10(5):e2701. doi: 10.7759/cureus.2701.,5,e2701,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the anticancer effect of methyl jasmonate on human colorectal cancer cells was investigated. Cell viability and apoptosis was assessed using a Cell Counting kit-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Methyl jasmonate suppressed cell viability and induced apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells. Additionally, methyl jasmonate increased the activation of caspase-3, inhibited the expression levels of enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway in human colorectal cancer. Downregulation of EZH2 expression enhanced the anticancer effect of methyl jasmonate on human colorectal cancer cells through suppression of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway.

These responses to Notch signaling involving both canonical and non-canonical pathways can be spatially and temporally variable and are highly cell-type dependent. Notch signaling can elicit opposite effects in regulating tumorigenicity (tumor-promoting versus tumor-suppressing function) as well as controlling immune cell responses. In various cancer types, Notch signaling elicits a ""cancer stem cell (CSC)"" phenotype that results in decreased proliferation, but resistance to various therapies, hence potentially contributing to cell dormancy and relapse. CSCs can reshape their niche by releasing paracrine factors and inflammatory cytokines, and the niche in return can support their quiescence and resistance to therapies as well as the immune response. Moreover, Notch signaling is one of the key regulators of hematopoiesis, immune cell differentiation, and inflammation and is implicated in various autoimmune diseases, carcinogenesis (leukemia), and tumor-induced immunosuppression. Notch can control the fate of various T cell types, including Th1, Th2, and the regulatory T cells (Tregs), and myeloid cells including macrophages, dendritic cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Both MDSCs and Tregs play an important role in supporting tumor cells (and CSCs) and in evading the immune response. In this review, we will discuss how Notch signaling regulates multiple aspects of the tumor-promoting environment by elucidating its role in CSCs, hematopoiesis, normal immune cell differentiation, and subsequently in tumor-supporting immunogenicity.",,"['Janghorban, Mahnaz', 'Xin, Li', 'Rosen, Jeffrey M', 'Zhang, Xiang H-F']","['Janghorban M', 'Xin L', 'Rosen JM', 'Zhang XH']",,"['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Dan L.

Hence, there is a continuing need to investigate novel agents for the treatment and management of cancer. Antitumor activity of greensporone C (GC), a new resorcylic acid lactone isolated from an organic extract of a culture of a Halenospora sp. freshwater fungus, was subjected for screening against a panel of leukemic cell lines (K562, U937, and AR320). In all the three cell lines, cell proliferation was inhibited in dose-dependent fashion. GC further arrested the cells in SubG0 phase in dose-dependent manner. Annexin V/PI dual staining data confirmed apoptotic death of treated K562 and U937 leukemic cells. Treatment with GC suppressed constitutively phosphorylated AKT and downregulated expression of inhibitor of apoptotic proteins XIAP, cIAP-1, and cIAP-2. In summation to this, GC-treated leukemic cells upregulated protein expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, Bax with concomitant decrease in expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Upregulation of Bax was associated with cytochrome c release which was confirmed from the collapse of mitochondrial membrane. Released cytochrome c further activated caspase cascade which in turn initiated apoptosis process. Anticancer activity of this isolated fungal compound GC was potentiated via stimulating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along with depletion of reduced glutathione (GSH) levels in K562 and U937 leukemic cells. Pretreatment of these cells with N-acetyl cysteine prevented GC-induced depletion of reduced GSH level and mitochondrial-caspase-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data show that GC modulates the apoptotic response of human leukemic cells and raises the possibility of its use as a novel therapeutic strategy for hematological malignancies.",,"['Prabhu, Kirti S', 'Siveen, Kodappully Sivaraman', 'Kuttikrishnan, Shilpa', 'Iskandarani, Ahmad N', 'Khan, Abdul Q', 'Merhi, Maysaloun', 'Omri, Halima E', 'Dermime, Said', 'El-Elimat, Tamam', 'Oberlies, Nicholas H', 'Alali, Feras Q', 'Uddin, Shahab']","['Prabhu KS', 'Siveen KS', 'Kuttikrishnan S', 'Iskandarani AN', 'Khan AQ', 'Merhi M', 'Omri HE', 'Dermime S', 'El-Elimat T', 'Oberlies NH', 'Alali FQ', 'Uddin S']",,"['Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'National Center for Cancer Care and Research, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, Faculty of Pharmacy, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, NC, United States.', 'College of Pharmacy, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar.', 'Translational Research Institute, Academic Health System, Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180716,Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,PMC6054921,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT', 'apoptosis', 'greensporone C', 'leukemia', 'reactive oxygen species']",,2018/08/01 06:00,2018/08/01 06:01,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2018/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2018.00720 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2018 Jul 16;9:720. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2018.00720. eCollection 2018.,,720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accurate biomarkers are needed to improve prognostic assessment. We analyzed RNA sequencing and survival data of 430 AML patients and identified HMGA2 as a novel prognostic marker. We validated a quantitative PCR test to study the association of HMGA2 expression with clinical outcomes in 358 AML samples. In this training cohort, HMGA2 was highly expressed in 22.3% of AML, mostly in patients with intermediate or adverse cytogenetics. High expression levels of HMGA2 (H + ) were associated with a lower frequency of complete remission (58.8% vs 83.4%, P < 0.001), worse 3-year overall survival (OS, 13.2% vs 43.5%, P < 0.001) and relapse-free survival (RFS, 10.8% vs 44.2%, P < 0.001). A positive HMGA2 test also identified a subgroup of patients unresponsive to standard treatments. Multivariable analyses showed that H + was independently associated with significantly worse OS and RFS, including in the intermediate cytogenetic risk category. These associations were confirmed in a validation cohort of 260 patient samples from the UK NCRI AML17 trial.

Our method uses a selectable cassette carrying the HyTK gene under the control of the FMR1 promoter with (CGG)n repeats in its 5' UTR, which is integrated into the unique RL5 site in murine erythroid leukemia cells. Carrier-size (CGG)n repeats markedly elevated the frequency of reporter inactivation, making cells ganciclovir resistant. These resistant clones had a unique mutational signature: a change in repeat length concurrent with mutagenesis in the reporter gene. Inactivation of genes implicated in break-induced replication, including Pold3, Pold4, Rad52, Rad51, and Smarcal1, reduced the frequency of ganciclovir-resistant clones to the baseline level that was observed in the absence of (CGG)n repeats. We propose that replication fork collapse at carrier-size (CGG)n repeats can trigger break-induced replication, which results in simultaneous repeat length changes and mutagenesis at a distance.",,"['Kononenko, Artem V', 'Ebersole, Thomas', 'Vasquez, Karen M', 'Mirkin, Sergei M']","['Kononenko AV', 'Ebersole T', 'Vasquez KM', 'Mirkin SM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4576-7582'],"['Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA.', 'Division of Pharmacology and Toxicology, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas, Austin, TX, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Tufts University, Medford, MA, USA. sergei.mirkin@tufts.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180730,United States,Nat Struct Mol Biol,Nature structural & molecular biology,101186374,"['0 (FMR1 protein, human)', '139135-51-6 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)']",,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Replication', 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/genetics', '*Genomic Instability', 'Humans', 'Mammals/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Trinucleotide Repeats']",PMC6082162,,,,2018/08/01 06:00,2019/08/27 06:00,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2017/11/01 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41594-018-0094-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41594-018-0094-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2018 Aug;25(8):669-676. doi: 10.1038/s41594-018-0094-9.

Although maintenance of amino acid homeostasis is critical for tumor growth, the contribution of GCN2 to cancer cell survival and proliferation is poorly understood. In this study, we generated GCN2 inhibitors and demonstrated that inhibition of GCN2 sensitizes cancer cells with low basal-level expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) to the antileukemic agent l-asparaginase (ASNase) in vitro and in vivo. We first tested acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells and showed that treatment with GCN2 inhibitors rendered ALL cells sensitive to ASNase by preventing the induction of ASNS, resulting in reduced levels of de novo protein synthesis. Comprehensive gene-expression profiling revealed that combined treatment with ASNase and GCN2 inhibitors induced the stress-activated MAPK pathway, thereby triggering apoptosis. By using cell-panel analyses, we also showed that acute myelogenous leukemia and pancreatic cancer cells were highly sensitive to the combined treatment. Notably, basal ASNS expression at protein levels was significantly correlated with sensitivity to combined treatment.

However, other cell types such as neutrophils and monocytes may also exceed the normal range in this disorder. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the frequency and prognostic value of neutrophilia defined as an ANC>7x10(9)/l and monocytosis- an absolute monocyte count (AMC)>1x10(9)/l in 113 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed clinical and laboratory data from the records of patients with CLL followed in the Hematology unit of a tertiary hospital in Israel. Patients were categorized according to their ANC and AMC before treatment and their data compared. RESULTS: In 24 (21%) patients, neutrophilia was present at diagnosis while 40 (35%) had monocytosis. We identified that 9% of cases had neutrophilia with normal AMC. This subgroup of patients had a better prognosis with lower mortality rate, longer time-to-treatment interval and a higher rate of complete or partial response to treatment compared to patients without neutrophilia or monocytosis. CONCLUSION: The presence of neutrophilia without monocytosis before treatment appears to be associated with a more favorable prognosis in CLL. These observations still need to be confirmed and validated in a larger cohort of patients.","['Copyright(c) 2018, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.', 'Delinasios), All rights reserved.']","['Levy, Ilana', 'Vadasz, Zahava', 'Polliack, Aaron', 'Tadmor, Tamar']","['Levy I', 'Vadasz Z', 'Polliack A', 'Tadmor T']",,"['Internal Medicine B Department, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'Division of Allergy & Clinical Immunology, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel.', 'Hematology Department, Hadassah University Hospital and Hebrew University Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'The Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, Israel tamar.tadmor@b-zion.org.il.', 'Hematology Unit, Bnai-Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['Neutrophilia, Hereditary']",IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Israel', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukocyte Count/methods', 'Leukocyte Disorders/*congenital/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ANC', 'CLL', 'monocytosis', 'neutrophilia']",,2018/08/01 06:00,2018/08/07 06:00,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2018/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/08/07 06:00 [medline]']","['38/8/4731 [pii]', '10.21873/anticanres.12780 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2018 Aug;38(8):4731-4734. doi: 10.21873/anticanres.12780.,8,4731-4734,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study aims to investigate the anticancer effect of a simultaneous inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS) and CK2 in MCF-7 breast cancer and CCRF-CEM leukemia cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The type of interaction between CK2 inhibitors: CX-4945, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-1H-benzimidazole (TBBi), or recently obtained 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-methyl-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)acetonitrile (2b) and TS-directed anticancer drug, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was determined using the MTT assay and a combination index method. The influence of the combined treatment on apoptosis in leukemia cells, as well as on cell-cycle progression and the levels of TS, CK2alpha and P-Ser529-p65 were determined in both cell lines, using flow cytometry and western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: The best synergistic effect was observed in CCRF-CEM cell line with the combination of 5-FU and 2b which correlated with a decrease in the endocellular CK2 activity and enhancement of the pro-apoptotic effect.

This first-in-class inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase has become a standard treatment for patients with CLL and MCL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an integrated safety analysis to characterize the frequency, severity, natural history, and outcomes of adverse events (AEs) with ibrutinib versus comparators. Data were pooled from 4 completed randomized controlled studies that had included 756 ibrutinib-treated and 749 comparator-treated patients with CLL/SLL or relapsed/refractory MCL. Safety analyses included reporting of AEs using crude and exposure-adjusted incidence rates. RESULTS: The median treatment duration was 13.3 months (maximum, 28.2 months) for ibrutinib and 5.8 months (maximum, 27.3 months) for comparators. When adjusted for exposure, diarrhea, atrial fibrillation, and hypertension were the only common grade >/= 3 AEs more often reported with ibrutinib than with the comparators. Dose reductions (7% vs. 14%) and discontinuation (12% vs. 16%) because of AEs occurred less often with ibrutinib, and deaths due to AEs occurred at similar rates (6% vs. 7%). When adjusted for exposure, the corresponding data were all lower with ibrutinib than with the comparators (0.06 vs. 0.22, 0.11 vs. 0.22, and 0.06 vs. 0.09 patient-exposure-years, respectively). The prevalence of common grade 3/4 AEs with ibrutinib generally decreased over time, with the exception of hypertension.

Intriguingly, the virus can also establish latency in these cells, but it remains unknown what influences the decision between lytic replication and the latency of the virus. Incoming virus genomes are confronted with the nuclear domain 10 (ND10) complex as part of an intrinsic antiviral response. Most herpesviruses can efficiently subvert ND10, but its role in HHV-6A infection remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated if the ND10 complex affects HHV-6A replication and contributes to the silencing of the virus genome during latency. We could demonstrate that ND10 complex was not dissociated upon infection, while the number of ND10 bodies was reduced in lytically infected cells. Virus replication was significantly enhanced upon knock down of the ND10 complex using shRNAs against its major constituents promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), hDaxx, and Sp100. In addition, we could demonstrate that viral genes are more efficiently silenced in the presence of a functional ND10 complex. Our data thereby provides the first evidence that the cellular ND10 complex plays an important role in suppressing HHV-6A lytic replication and the silencing of the virus genome in latently infected cells.",,"['Sanyal, Anirban', 'Wallaschek, Nina', 'Glass, Mandy', 'Flamand, Louis', 'Wight, Darren J', 'Kaufer, Benedikt B']","['Sanyal A', 'Wallaschek N', 'Glass M', 'Flamand L', 'Wight DJ', 'Kaufer BB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4601-9079', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1328-2695']","['Institut fur Virologie, Freie Universitat Berlin, Robert von Ostertag-Strasse 7-13, 14163 Berlin, Germany. a.sanyal@fu-berlin.de.', 'Institute for Molecular Infection Biology, Julius-Maximilians-Universitat Wupsilonrzburg, 97080 Wupsilonrzburg, Germany. nina.wallaschek@uni-wuerzburg.de.', 'School of Science and Sport, University of the West of Scotland, ML3 0JB Glasgow, UK.

Decursinol angelate (DA), a pyranocoumarin compound obtained from the roots of Angelica gigas, has been reported to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of DA on the MAP kinase and NFkappaB signaling pathways and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines were investigated in phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-activated human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage (Raw 264.7) cell lines. PMA induced the activation of the MAP kinase-NFkappaB pathway and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in differentiated monocytes. Treatment with DA inhibited the activation of MAP kinases and the translocation of NFkappaB, and decreased the expression and exogenous secretion of IL-1beta and IL-6. Furthermore, LPS-stimulated Raw 264.7 cells were found to have increased expression of M1 macrophage-associated markers, such as NADPH oxidase (NOX) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and the M2 macrophage-associated marker CD11b. LPS also activated pro-inflammatory cytokines and Erk-NFkappaB. Treatment with DA suppressed LPS-induced macrophage polarization and the inflammatory response by blocking Raf-ERK and the translocation of NFkappaB in Raw 264.7 cells. Treatment with DA also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta and IL-6, NOX, and iNOS in Raw 264.7 cells. These results suggest that DA has the potential to inhibit macrophage polarization and inflammation by blocking the activation of pro-inflammatory signals. These anti-inflammatory effects of DA may contribute to its potential use as a therapeutic strategy against various inflammation-induced cancers.",,"['Islam, Salman Ul', 'Lee, Jung Ho', 'Shehzad, Adeeb', 'Ahn, Eun-Mi', 'Lee, You Mie', 'Lee, Young Sup']","['Islam SU', 'Lee JH', 'Shehzad A', 'Ahn EM', 'Lee YM', 'Lee YS']",,"['School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea. salman2013@knu.ac.kr.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea. quiet93@knu.ac.kr.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences, School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology, Islamabad 44000, Pakistan. adeeb.shehzad@smme.nust.edu.pk.', 'Division of Biotechnology and Convergence, Daegu 38610, Korea. ahnEM@dhu.ac.kr.', 'College of Pharmacy, National Basic Research Laboratory of Vascular Homeostasis Regulation, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea. lym@knu.ac.kr.', 'School of Life Sciences, BK21 Plus KNU Creative BioResearch Group, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 41566, Korea. yselee@knu.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180727,Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', 'E95RTO3YQR (decursin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzopyrans/*pharmacology', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Cell Polarity/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/*cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Protein Transport/drug effects', 'RAW 264.7 Cells']",PMC6222640,['NOTNLM'],"['MAP kinase', 'NFkappaB', 'cytokines', 'decursinol angelate', 'inflammation']",,2018/08/01 06:00,2018/10/30 06:00,['2018/08/01 06:00'],"['2018/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/30 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules23081880 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules23081880 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2018 Jul 27;23(8). pii: molecules23081880. doi: 10.3390/molecules23081880.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: From February 2012 to June 2017, 21 patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia underwent allo-HSCT with FLAG sequential Bu/Cy conditioning regimen. Transplantation-related complications and clinical outcome were retrospectively analyzed. Results: After conditioning, no hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD) and grade hemorrhagic cystitis occurred. 76.2% (16/21) patients had fever with 4 septicemia. One patient died of septic shock before engraftment. Twenty patients achieved neutrophil engraftment with a median time of 13 days (range, 10 to 21 days). Seventeen patients achieved platelet engraftment with a median time of 18 days (range, 9 to 25 days). The cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 39.5%, and 3 patients developed grade - aGVHD. Of 19 patients who survived more than 100 days after transplantation, 4 had local chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). Of 21 patients, the median survival time was 15 months (range, 0.5 to 67 months) post-transplantation. Transplantation-related mortality rate was 28.7%. Leukemia relapse occurred in 4 patients with a median time of 4 months (range, 3 to 8 months) after transplantation. The cumulative relapse rate at 1 year was 21.4%. The 1-year and 3-year overall survival (OS) rates were 60.7% and 54.9% respectively. Log-rank analysis revealed that bone marrow blasts >/= 20% or extramedullary leukemia before transplantation, poor platelet engraftment and grade - aGVHD were significantly related to shortened OS (P<0.05). Conclusions: Allo-HSCT with FLAG sequential Bu/Cy conditioning regimen in patients with refractory/relapsed myeloid leukemia has acceptable transplantation-related risk and relapse rate.

We conducted a dose-finding study of venetoclax in combination with bendamustine-rituximab (BR) in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Patients and methods: BR was given for six cycles at standard doses. Intermittent and continuous oral venetoclax administration was explored at 50-1200 mg daily doses. Co-primary objectives included safety, pharmacokinetics (PKs), maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), and recommended phase II dose (RP2D); secondary objective was preliminary efficacy. Results: Sixty patients were enrolled: 32 with follicular lymphoma, 22 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and 6 with marginal zone lymphoma. Nausea (70%), neutropenia (68%), diarrhea (55%), and thrombocytopenia (52%) were the most frequent adverse events (AEs). Most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (60%) and lymphopenia (38%). Serious AEs were reported in 24 patients; the most frequent were febrile neutropenia and disease progression (8% each). Five patients died from either disease progression (n = 4) or respiratory failure (n = 1). MTD was not reached; RP2D for venetoclax-BR combination was established as 800 mg daily continuously. Venetoclax PK exposure with and without BR was comparable. For all patients, overall response rate was 65%. Median duration of overall response, overall survival, and progression-free survival was 38.3 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 10.4-NR], not yet reached, and 10.7 months (95% CI 4.3-21.0), respectively. Conclusions: This study established the safety profile of venetoclax in combination with BR, and results demonstrated tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination.

Such inhibitors expressed significant binding interactions with DOT1L by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based binding assay. The results of molecular docking experiments suggested that they could occupy the SAM binding pocket of DOT1L. Compounds 8h and 9e exhibited better inhibitory activities but poor selectivities against the both MLL-rearranged MV4-11 cells and the non MLL-rearranged Kasumi-1 cells than those of 3a and 3e, which suggested that the introduction of the amino side chain would be beneficial for their anti leukemia cells proliferation activities, possibly due to the improvement of the fat solubility.

The following four features were used to identify immature cCD3+ T cells: CD34+, TdT+, but mCD3-/dim+, and CD45dim+. Among these features, either TdT or CD34 expression was the most useful and were found in 93.8% of patients at diagnosis and 86.7% of patients who relapsed. Although some of the immature markers had disappeared in 23 of 59 cases after therapy, only one case presented with a false negative MRD. Of the 74 consecutive patients who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), MRD-positive patients showed a higher relapse rate, a higher cumulative incidence of relapse at 4 years and a shorter median relapse-free survival than MRD-negative patients at post-HSCT(72.7% vs 17.3%, P=0.000; 100% vs 19.9%, P<0.0001; and 16 months vs undefined, P<0.0001).

Patients ages 18 months to 25 years with leukemia/lymphoma or having undergone HCT who required invasive mechanical ventilation for bilateral lung disease with an oxygenation index (OI) > 10 and <37 were studied. Interventions used were intratracheal instillation of either calfactant or air placebo (1 or 2 doses). Forty-three subjects were enrolled between November 2010 and June 2015: 26 assigned to calfactant and 17 to placebo. There were no significant differences in the primary outcome, which was survival to PICU discharge (adjusted hazard ratio of mortality for calfactant versus placebo, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, .53 to 6.05; P=.35), OI, functional outcomes, or ventilator-free days, adjusting for risk strata and Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRISM) score. Despite the risk-stratified randomization, more allogeneic HCT patients received calfactant (76% and 39%, respectively) due to low recruitment at various sites. This imbalance is important because independent of treatment arm and while adjusting for PRISM score, those with allogeneic HCT had a nonsignificant higher likelihood of death at PICU discharge (adjusted odds ratio, 3.02; 95% confidence interval, .76 to 12.06; P=.12). Overall, 86% of the patients who survived to PICU discharge also were successfully discharged from the hospital. These data do not support the use of calfactant among this high mortality group of pediatric leukemia/lymphoma and/or HCT patients with PARDS to increase survival. In spite of poor enrollment, allogeneic HCT patients with PARDS appeared to be characterized by higher mortality than even other high-risk immunosuppressed groups. Conducting research among these children is challenging but necessary, because survival to PICU discharge usually results in successful discharge to home.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

Adverse risk AML was defined according to the 2017 ELN cytogenetic risk classification. The 2-year nonrelapse mortality was 19% for Haplo, 18% for 10/10 UD and 18% for 9/10 UD (P = .9). The relapse incidence was not significantly affected by donor source, with a 2-year incidence of 27% for Haplo HSCT, 39% for 10/10 UD and 37% for 9/10 UD SCT (P = .3).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression level of miR-363 was detected in laryngeal cancer tissues and cells (TU-177), respectively. Luciferase assay was performed to evaluate the interaction between miR-363 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). The effect of the miR-363/Mcl-1 axis on TU-177 cells was determined by subsequent experiments including cell proliferation, invasion, apoptosis and the expression level of Mcl-1. RESULTS: In the present study, we found that miR-363 was both repressed in laryngeal cancer tissues and cells (TU-177). To find the regulating target of miR-363, we searched three publicly available algorithms, including TargetScan, miRDB, and microRNA. Results showed that Mcl-1 was a direct target of miR-363, and the Luciferase assay confirmed our suggestion. Subsequent experiments indicated that the decreased expression of Mcl-1 resulting from the up-regulation of miR-363 could deaccelerate cell proliferation and invasion, and accelerate cell apoptosis in laryngeal cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our research revealed the suppressed function of miR-363 in laryngeal cancer by targeting Mcl-1. Meanwhile, we found that the restoration of miR-363 could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of laryngeal cancer.",,"['Feng, W-T', 'Yao, R', 'Xu, L-J', 'Zhong, X-M', 'Liu, H', 'Sun, Y', 'Zhou, L-L']","['Feng WT', 'Yao R', 'Xu LJ', 'Zhong XM', 'Liu H', 'Sun Y', 'Zhou LL']",,"[""Department of Oncology, The Affiliated Huai'an No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huai'an, China. bogy2004a@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN363 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Antagomirs/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Laryngeal Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'MicroRNAs/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism']",,,,,2018/07/31 06:00,2019/11/13 06:00,['2018/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201807_15512 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2018 Jul;22(14):4564-4572. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201807_15512.,14,4564-4572,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The anticancer enzyme has been in clinical use to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia for many years. Other types of anticancer enzymes have been investigated in laboratory studies and clinical trials. Area covered: This paper will provide perspectives on the indications, anticancer mechanisms, enzymatic characteristics (such as molecular weight, organism source, and kinetic parameters) and pharmacokinetic behaviors of anticancer enzymes and their delivery systems by systematically analyzing available literature. The pharmacodynamics of anticancer enzyme delivery systems has also been summarized. Expert opinion: Anticancer enzymes kill cancer cells by depleting important nutrients required for growth or producing metabolite toxic to tumor cells. Suitable enzyme delivery systems have demonstrated promising effects on the pharmacokinetics, bioactivity and application of anticancer enzymes. Their current limitations and future potential are analyzed.[Figure: see text].",,"['Yan, Shenglei', 'Yang, Lan', 'Lu, Luyang', 'Guo, Qi', 'Hu, Xueyuan', 'Yuan, Yuming', 'Li, Yao', 'Wu, Mingjun', 'Zhang, Jingqing']","['Yan S', 'Yang L', 'Lu L', 'Guo Q', 'Hu X', 'Yuan Y', 'Li Y', 'Wu M', 'Zhang J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3291-0995'],"['a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'b Chongqing Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology and Epigenetics , the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'c College of Pharmacy, Southwest University for Nationalities , Chengdu , China.', 'd Center for Certification and Evaluation , Chongqing Food and Drug Administration , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.', 'a Chongqing Research Center for Pharmaceutical Engineering , Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180806,England,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol,Expert opinion on drug metabolism & toxicology,101228422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzymes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enzymes/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer enzyme', 'anticancer effect', 'delivery system', 'indication', 'mechanism', 'pharmacokinetics']",,2018/07/31 06:00,2018/09/20 06:00,['2018/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17425255.2018.1505863 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Drug Metab Toxicol. 2018 Sep;14(9):951-960. doi: 10.1080/17425255.2018.1505863.

METHODS: Participants included 365 ALL survivors (mean age at evaluation of 28.6 +/- 5.9 years) and 365 age-, sex-, and race-matched community controls. Self-report of poor general health, poor mental health, functional impairments, and activity limitations were used to describe adverse health status. Fitness was evaluated by assessing flexibility, muscular strength and endurance, peak oxygen uptake, and balance. Generalized linear models were used to examine associations between fitness metrics and health status. RESULTS: Survivors were more likely than controls to report poor general health (20.6% vs. 10.4%, risk ratio [RR] = 2.0, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 1.4-2.9), poor mental health (28.0% vs. 14.5%, RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.4-2.6), functional impairments (10.5% vs. 4.1%, RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.4-4.6), and activity limitations (29.0% vs. 14.4%, RR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.5-2.7). Survivors whose balance scores were more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean of the control population were more likely to report poor general health (RR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.1-2.8), poor mental health (RR = 1.9, 95% CI = 1.3-2.8), and functional limitations (RR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2-56). Survivors with low strength were more likely to report poor general health (RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-3.1), functional impairments (RR = 4.2, 95% CI = 1.7-10.4), and activity limitations (RR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.2-2.8).

METHODS: A mixed-method study on the basis of a questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The CML patient advocacy group asked patients to participate. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (54 +/- 12 years, 43% male) using imatinib, dasatinib or nilotinib participated. Fifteen patients (25%) reported to miss an intake at least once a month. Most were not worried about missing an intake and did not discuss missed intakes with their healthcare provider (HCP). Social activities disturbing daily routines and the wish to avoid side effects resulted in nonadherence. Patients wanted extensive and understandable information provided timely on all aspects of CML treatment, in particular on side effects, and a more supportive HCP attitude. CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to CML medication does not cause concern in all patients and is not discussed pro-actively. HCP have a clear role in supporting medication adherence in CML and must be aware that social activities disturbing daily routines contribute to nonadherence. HCP should discuss (non)adherence in a direct manner, motivate patients to play an active role in managing their medication and timely provide extensive and understandable information on all aspects of CML.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Presence of Janus kinase (JAK)-2 gene mutations is a diagnostic marker and standard diagnostic criterion. World Health Organization 2016 diagnostic criteria for PV, focusing on haemoglobin levels and bone marrow morphology, are mandatory. PV therapy aims at managing long-term risks of vascular complications and progression towards transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. Risk stratification for thrombotic complications guides therapeutic decisions. Low-risk patients are treated first line with low-dose aspirin and phlebotomy. Cytoreduction is considered for low-risk (phlebotomy intolerance, severe/progressive symptoms, cardiovascular risk factors) and high-risk patients. Hydroxyurea is suspected of leukaemogenic potential. IFN-alpha has demonstrated efficacy in many clinical trials; its pegylated form is best tolerated, enabling less frequent administration than standard interferon. Ropeginterferon alfa-2b has been shown to be more efficacious than hydroxyurea. JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib is approved for hydroxyurea resistant/intolerant patients.

These regimens are poorly tolerated by patients with comorbidities, for whom the obinutuzumab-chlorambucil combination became the recommended firstline treatment. Objectives We aimed to analyze reallife experience with the obinutuzumab-chlorambucil combination as the frontline treatment in elderly and unfit patients. Patients and methods The retrospective analysis included 86 elderly patients (median age, 74 years) with CLL and a significant burden of comorbidities, treated with obinutuzumab-chlorambucil as the frontline regimen. All patients had a Cumulative Illness Rating Scale score greater than 6 and/or creatinine clearance of 30 to 69 ml/min. Results Overall response rate at 2 months after treatment completion was 95.3%, with complete remission (CR) rate of 43% and partial remission (PR) rate of 52.3%. Stable disease rate was 4.7%. Progressive disease was not observed after treatment completion. The median progressionfree survival (PFS) was not reached after a median followup of 18 months; estimated PFS at 30 months was 62%. We observed 6 relapses (7%), 3 (3.5%) in patients obtaining CR, and 3 (3.5%) in those with PR after immunochemotherapy. The most frequent adverse events were neutropenia and infusionrelated reactions (IRRs). Grade-3 neutropenia occurred in 11.6% of patients, and grade-3 IRRs, in 2.3%. There were no adverse events of grade 4 or 5.

In our study, the prototype LQFM166 (2), designed through molecular simplification strategy inspired in the Nutlins compounds, was synthetized, characterized and the mechanisms of cell death were investigated. In addition, we estimated the starting doses for acute oral systemic toxicity tests according to the OECD Guidance Document No.129 - 3T3 NRU. The cytotoxic profile of LQFM166 (2) was determined in K-562cells, a p53-null cell line, since previous studies also showed activity of LQFM166 (2) on this cells. After 24, 48 or 72h of compound treatment, using MTT reduction assay, the IC50 values found were 100.1muM, 56.76muM and 45.11muM, respectively. LQFM166 (2) was cytotoxic for leukemia cells in a concentration-time-dependent manner. Cell death mechanisms studies of LQFM166 on K-562cells, revealed that the compound induced cell cycle arrest, increased the expression of caspase 3/7, 8 and 9, cytochrome c, Bax, p21 and p27. Additionally, a decrease in the expression of the Bcl-2 and cyclin-B1 was observed. The apoptotic inducer profile of the compound was confirmed by phosphatidylserine externalization. Investigation of complexation of p53/MDM2 was carried out by ELISA assay using 3T3 cell, showing a decrease in the p53-MDM2 complex induced by the compound. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity in basal fibroblasts 3T3 was determined to estimate LD50. LQFM166 (2) reduced 3T3 cells viability with the IC50 of 185.3muM and estimated LD50 of 706.7mg/kg (category 4 of GHS).

However, few data comparing the measurement of adult ALL MRD using different methods in daily practice are available. We conducted an analysis comparing the importance of flow cytometry (FCM) and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the assessment of MRD in adult ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-six consecutive adult patients with both Philadelphia-negative and -positive ALL treated according to an intensive protocol were enrolled in the study. Bone marrow samples were acquired on day 26 and during week 11 of treatment. MRD evaluation was performed using 8-color FCM and PCR of immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene clonal rearrangements and BCR-ABL1, KMT2A-AF4 and E2A-PBX1 fusion genes. RESULTS: On day 26, both FCM and PCR seemed to have good discrimination sensitivity for overall survival (P = .001 to .008) and progression-free survival (P = .03 to .04) prediction for both Philadelphia-positive and -negative cases. The most sensitive method in week 11 was PCR including all results > 0 considered to indicate MRD positivity (P = .002 for overall survival and P = .02 for progression-free survival). PCR with other cutoffs was not sufficiently sensitive in week 11. Moreover, no FCM(+) samples were found in week 11. The subanalysis of the Philadelphia-negative patients showed similar results.

Amongst these mutations, the ""gatekeeper"" T315I is a major concern as it renders leukemic cells resistant to all licenced TKI except Ponatinib. We report here that Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy is a powerful methodology allowing rapid and direct identification of a spectral signature in single cells expressing T315I-mutated BCR-ABL. The specificity of this spectral signature is confirmed using a Dox-inducible T315I-mutated BCR-ABL-expressing human UT-7cells as well as in murine embryonic stem cells. Transcriptome analysis of UT-7cells expressing BCR-ABL as compared to BCR-ABL T315I clearly identified a molecular signature which could be at the origin of the generation of metabolic changes giving rise to the spectral signature. Thus, these results suggest that this new methodology can be applied to the identification of leukemic cells harbouring the T315I mutation at the single cell level and could represent a novel early detection tool of mutant clones. It could also be applied to drug screening strategies to target T315I-mutated leukemic cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

LIF plays an important role in reproduction by regulating immune response, decidualization, and implantation in several species. However, the expression of LIF and LIFR in the endometrium throughout the estrous cycle and pregnancy in pigs is not fully understood. METHODS: We analyzed the expression of LIF and LIFR in the endometrium on days 0 (estrus), 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 of the estrous cycle, and days 12, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 114 of pregnancy, in conceptuses on days 12 and 15, and in chorioallantoic tissues on days 30, 60, 90, and 114 of pregnancy in pigs. We also determined the effects of estrogen and progesterone on the expression of LIF and LIFR in endometrial tissues. RESULTS: The expression of LIF increased in the endometrium during the late diestrus phase of the estrous cycle and during mid- to late- pregnancy, while the expression of LIFR increased during early pregnancy. The expression of LIF was induced by increasing doses of estrogen, whereas the expression of LIFR was induced by increasing doses of progesterone. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that the expression of LIF and its receptor LIFR in the endometrium is regulated in a stage-specific manner during the estrous cycle and pregnancy, suggesting that LIF and its receptor signaling system may play critical roles in regulating endometrial function in pigs.",,"['Yoo, Inkyu', 'Chae, Soogil', 'Han, Jisoo', 'Lee, Soohyung', 'Kim, Hyun Jong', 'Ka, Hakhyun']","['Yoo I', 'Chae S', 'Han J', 'Lee S', 'Kim HJ', 'Ka H']",,"['Department of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 26493, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 26493, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 26493, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 26493, Korea.', 'Dairy Science Division, National Institute of Animal Science, Rural Development Administration, Cheonan 31000, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Yonsei University, Wonju 26493, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180726,Korea (South),Asian-Australas J Anim Sci,Asian-Australasian journal of animal sciences,9884245,,,,PMC6325384,['NOTNLM'],"['Endometrium', 'Estrous Cycle', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor', 'Pig', 'Pregnancy']",,2018/07/31 06:00,2018/07/31 06:01,['2018/07/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/31 06:01 [medline]', '2018/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['ajas.18.0429 [pii]', '10.5713/ajas.18.0429 [doi]']",ppublish,Asian-Australas J Anim Sci. 2019 Feb;32(2):192-200. doi: 10.5713/ajas.18.0429.

A panel of well-documented pro-apoptotic genes, including p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22 (PERP), are up-regulated and collectively mediate ROS induced apoptosis. The epigenetic mechanism whereby ROS stimulates PERP transcription, however, lacks in-depth characterization. Here we report that the transcriptional modulator megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is activated by H2O2 treatment in skeletal muscle cells (C2C12). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediated silencing or small-molecule compound (CCG-1423) mediated inhibition of MKL1 attenuated H2O2 induced apoptosis of C2C12 cells. Over-expression of MKL1 potentiated trans-activation of PERP whereas MKL1 ablation/inhibition abrogated the induction of PERP by H2O2 in C2C12 cells. Mechanistically, MKL1 interacted with and was recruited to the PERP promoter by the transcription factor E2F1. Once bound to the PERP promoter, MKL1 engaged the histone demethylase KDM3A to modulate the chromatin structure surrounding the PERP promoter thereby leading to PERP trans-activation. Depletion of either E2F1 or KDM3A blocked the induction of PERP by H2O2. In conclusion, our data illustrate a novel epigenetic pathway that links PERP transcription to ROS-induced apoptosis in skeletal muscle cells.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

OBJECTIVE: In these children, hypertriglyceridemia rarely causes symptoms and mostly responds well to a low-fat diet. Only few patients demand further therapy, which is not clearly approved in the literature to date. Therefore, it may be important to compile generally accepted standard procedures for lipid-lowering therapy in the pediatric ALL population. METHODS: We performed a study on 119 newly diagnosed pediatric patients with ALL, all treated according to the ALL-BFM 2000 protocol at our institution between the years 2000 and 2009, to evaluate the incidence of hypertriglyceridemia and the efficacy of a combination therapy with omega-3 fatty acids and acipimox in hypertriglyceridemic patients who did not respond to diet. RESULTS: We observed hypertriglyceridemia in 34.5% of patients in this collective. In the majority, normalization of triglycerides was successfully managed by administration of a low-fat diet. However, 7.6% of patients (related to total study population) with hypertriglyceridemia did not show diminished lipid levels during diet and/or presented with symptoms such as abdominal pain, dyspnea, or anginal chest pain. In these cases, we performed a lipid-lowering combination therapy with omega-3 fatty acids and acipimox. We observed a prompt decline of serum triglycerides to normal values and an improvement of symptoms within days after onset of this therapy without occurrence of any side effects. CONCLUSION: In summary, the combination treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and acipimox could represent an alternative to other reported lipid-lowering therapies without severe adverse reactions.","['Copyright (c) 2018 National Lipid Association.

A cause is thought to be T cell repression through TGF-beta, which is massively accumulating in the tumor tissue. Here, we show that T cells with a CD28-zeta CAR, but not with a 4-1BB-zeta CAR, resist TGF-beta-mediated repression. Mechanistically, LCK activation and consequently IL-2 release and autocrine IL-2 receptor signaling mediated TGF-beta resistance; deleting the LCK-binding motif in the CD28 CAR abolished both IL-2 secretion and TGF-beta resistance, while IL-2 add-back restored TGF-beta resistance. Other gamma-cytokines like IL-7 and IL-15 could replace IL-2 in this context. This is demonstrated by engineering IL-2 deficient CD28DeltaLCK-zeta CAR T cells with a hybrid IL-7 receptor to provide IL-2R beta chain signaling upon IL-7 binding. Such modified T cells showed improved CAR T cell activity against TGF-beta(+) tumors. Data draw the concept that an autocrine loop resulting in IL-2R signaling can make CAR T cells more potent in staying active against TGF-beta(+) solid tumors.","['Copyright (c) 2018 The American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.

METHODS: 9028 recipients of hematopoietic cell autotransplants (1995-2010) for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL; n = 916), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 3546) and plasma cell myeloma (PCM; n = 4566), reported to the CIBMTR, were analyzed for risk of subsequent AML or MDS. RESULTS: 335 MDS/AML cases were diagnosed posttransplant (3.7%). Variables associated with an increased risk for AML or MDS in multivariate analyses were: (1) conditioning with total body radiation versus chemotherapy alone for HL (HR = 4.0; 95% confidence interval [1.4, 11.6]) and NHL (HR = 2.5 [1.1, 2.5]); (2) >/=3 versus 1 line of chemotherapy for NHL (HR = 1.9 [1.3, 2.8]); and (3) subjects with NHL transplanted in 2005-2010 versus 1995-1999 (HR = 2.1 [1.5, 3.1]). Using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) data, we found risks for AML/MDS in HL, NHL and PCM to be 5-10 times the background rate. In contrast, relative risks were 10-50 for AML and approximately 100 for MDS in the autotransplant cohort.

Previous reports indicated an adverse prognostic effect of atypical BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangements with submicroscopic ABL1-BCR deletions on derivative chromosome 9 [der(9)] in CML patients. Dual color dual fusion locus-specific BCR/ABL1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis together with G-banding using trypsin and Giemsa (GTG banding) was performed in 489 patients at different stages of CML to investigate the spectrum of BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangements. Among the study group analyzed, a significantly higher frequency of BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangements that is consistent with der(9) deletion were observed in the blast crisis (BC) phase at 41.67%, followed by the accelerated phase (AP) at 36.84%, the imatinib mesylate (IM)-resistant chronic phase (CP) at 23.08%, and the lowest incidence was found in de novo CP at 16.61%. 1R1G1F (1 red, 1 green, 1 fusion) with concurrent loss of ABL1-BCR fusion gene on der(9) chromosome was the major signal pattern identified in each group. The results from the current study show that this unusual BCR/ABL1 gene rearrangement is one of the steering forces toward disease progression in CML. Patients in AP/BC of CML with der(9) deletion showed poor response to IM therapy; however, patients with der(9) deletion in the early phases of CML responded well to IM treatment.

SAR studies indicated that the N-substituted benzyl and C-5 substituted phenyl groups greatly enhance their cytotoxic activity, whereas an intact carbonyl functionality on C-3 present in the parent ring is required to maintain such a potency. Particularly, N-(p-methoxybenzyl)-5-(p-methoxyphenyl)isatin (compound 2m) showed the highest antitumor activity against K562cell lines (IC50=0.03muM).

As an important sensor of ER stress, inositol-requiring protein-1alpha (IRE1alpha) promotes the survival of acute myeloid leukemia. NLRP1 inflammasome activation promotes metastatic melanoma growth and that IRE1alpha can increase NLRP1 inflammasome gene expression. This study aimed to investigate the role and molecular mechanism of IRE1alpha in CML cell growth. We found that overexpression of IRE1alpha or NLRP1 significantly promoted the proliferation and decreased the apoptosis of CML cells, whereas downregulation of these two genes showed the opposite effects. 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), an ER stress inhibitor, reduced the expression of IRE1alpha and NLRP1. IRE1alpha elevated NLRP1 expression via cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation. NLRP1 inflammasome was activated in CML cells and its activation partly reversed ER stress inhibitor-induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, inhibition of IRE1alpha/NLRP1 pathway sensitized CML cells to imatinib-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, IRE1alpha expression was elevated and NLRP1 inflammasome was activated in primary cells from CML patients. Downregulation of IRE1alpha or NLRP1 suppressed the proliferation and elevated the apoptosis of primary CML cells. Collectively, this study demonstrated that the IRE1alpha/CREB/NLRP1 pathway contributes to the progression of CML and the development of imatinib resistance. Hence, targeting ER stress-related IRE1alpha expression or NLRP1 inflammasome activation may block CML development.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to facilitate viral spread, HCMV extends the naturally short 48-h lifespan of monocytes by stimulating a non-canonical activation of Akt during viral entry, which leads to the increased expression of a specific subset of antiapoptotic proteins. In this study, global analysis of the Akt signaling network showed HCMV induced a more robust activation of the entire network when compared to normal myeloid growth factors. Furthermore, we found a unique interplay between HCMV-activated Akt and the stress response transcription heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) that allowed for the synthesis of both cap- and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-containing antiapoptotic mRNAs such as myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), respectively. As generally a switch from cap-dependent to IRES-mediated translation occurs during cellular stress, the ability of HCMV to concurrently drive both types of translation produces a distinct milieu of prosurvival proteins needed for the viability of infected monocytes. Indeed, we found inhibition of XIAP led to death of approximately 99% of HCMV-infected monocytes while having minimal effect on the viability of uninfected cells. Taken together, these data indicate that the aberrant activation of the Akt network by HCMV induces the upregulation of a unique subset of antiapoptotic proteins specifically required for the survival of infected monocytes. Consequently, our study highlights the possibility of exploiting these virus-induced changes to prevent viral spread in immunocompromised patients at high-risk for HCMV exposure.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

However, except for the success story with BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), critical review of results of a large number of clinical trials indicates that the clinical success with kinase inhibitors has been overall disappointing. These alarming results call for critical assessment of whether there is some fundamental flaw in the design of strategies to target phosphorylation-dependent oncogenic signaling for cancer therapy. This viewpoint debates on one potential, but thus far largely neglected, molecular explanation why inhibition of protein kinases is not sufficient for cancer cure. We note that the phosphorylation status, and thus the oncogenic potential of any given protein, is not regulated only by kinases, but rather by an intimate balance between kinases and their antagonist phosphatases. We further review the supporting functional evidence that for oncogenic transformation of human cells it is not enough to activate kinase signaling by activated kinases, if a group of counteracting tumor suppressor phosphatases is not inactivated. Based on these considerations, and a very recently emerged role of oncogenic function of a group of phosphatase inhibitor proteins as human oncoproteins, we propose that in order to efficiently inhibit phosphorylation-dependent signaling in cancer cells, and thus provide better therapeutic index, the kinase inhibitors should be combined with strategies to reactivate tumor suppressor phosphatases such as Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A).",['(c) 2018 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.'],"['Westermarck, Jukka']",['Westermarck J'],,"['Turku Centre for Biotechnology, University of Turku and Abo Akademi University, Turku, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, University of Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",20180817,England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Protein Phosphatase 2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Phosphatase 2/genetics/*metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['* AURK', '* EGFR', '* RAS', '* SET', '* SMAP', '*AZD6244', '*CIP2A', '*DT-061', '*Midostaurin', '*PME-1']",,2018/07/29 06:00,2019/06/08 06:00,['2018/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/febs.14617 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2018 Nov;285(22):4139-4145. doi: 10.1111/febs.14617.

Here, we report a c-Myc pathway-targeted screening of seven natural anticancer compounds, in which we identified cryptotanshinone as a highly promising agent for CML therapy. Cryptotanshinone depletes c-Myc in CML by repressing the phosphorylation of STAT5. Decreased viability of K562 cells correlated with p-STAT5 suppression. Unexpectedly, imatinib activates rather than inhibits the phosphorylation of STAT3 in K562 cells. We demonstrated that cryptotanshinone, as a dual inhibitor of p-STAT5 and p-STAT3, can effectively block IL-6-mediated STAT3 activation and reverse BCR-ABL kinase-independent drug resistance. Moreover, we showed that the epigenetic rebalance between decreased BCR-ABL/STAT5/c-Myc and enhanced STAT3/multi-drug resistance (MDR) pathways is characteristic of the cancer stem cell-like property of K562/ADR. Simultaneously suppressing these two pathways using cryptotanshinone proves to be critical for the malignant network redress and MDR reversal of K562/ADR. These studies reveal the dual functions of cryptotanshinone that suppress key oncogenic proliferation and drug-resistant pathways in CML cells by targeting p-STAT5 and p-STAT3, providing a new strategy for CML therapy that takes advantage of natural products.",,"['Dong, Bowen', 'Liang, Zirui', 'Chen, Zhirong', 'Li, Bin', 'Zheng, Lingling', 'Yang, Jianhua', 'Zhou, Hui', 'Qu, Lianghu']","['Dong B', 'Liang Z', 'Chen Z', 'Li B', 'Zheng L', 'Yang J', 'Zhou H', 'Qu L']",,"['Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510275, China. lssqlh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180720,China,Sci China Life Sci,Science China.

This has become particularly relevant when residual levels of leukemia usually fall below the level of detection by cytogenetic analysis. Forty-two CML patients, including 18 males (42.86%) and 24 females (57.14%) aged 7-75 years, were enlisted for the study and followed-up for the response to imatinib treatment. Patients were subjected to Multiplex RT-PCR (reverse-transcriptase PCR) and were all found to harbor either e13a2 or the e14a2, which could be analyzed by a single Taqman probe based quantitation kit (Geno-Sen's) to quantitate the BCR-ABL transcript load. The Multiplex RT-PCR and peripheral blood cytogenetics providing specific and sensitive detection of BCR-ABL fusion transcripts and metaphase signal load respectively were used as parallel reference tools to authenticate the q-PCR findings. There was 100% concordance between the multiplex RT-PCR and the q-PCR as every positive RT-PCR assay for a transcript reflected as q-PCR load of above 0% for that transcript. q-PCR also demonstrated a strong Pearson correlation with the cytogenetic response.",['(c) 2018 The Author(s).'],"['Azad, Niyaz A', 'Shah, Zafar A', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Rasool, Roohi', 'Jeelani, Samoon']","['Azad NA', 'Shah ZA', 'Pandith AA', 'Rasool R', 'Jeelani S']",,"['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India azad.niyaz6@gmail.com.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20181005,England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping/methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/methods', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6172424,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cytogenetics', '*e13a2', '*e14a2', '*q-PCR']",,2018/07/29 06:00,2019/06/25 06:00,['2018/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/25 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20180974 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20180974 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2018 Oct 5;38(5). pii: BSR20180974. doi: 10.1042/BSR20180974.

The clinical utility of this subclassification scheme, particularly the expansion of blast-based subgroups, has not been validated. In this study, a large single-institution CMML patient cohort (n = 629) was used to assess the prognostic impact of the newly proposed categories. Patients were risk stratified according to the CMML-specific Prognostic Scoring System (CPSS) and the MD Anderson Prognostic Scoring System. MP-CMML patients had significantly shorter overall survival (OS; P < .0001; hazard ratio: 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.65) and median duration to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) transformation (P < .0001; 15.2 vs 22.0 months) compared with MDS-CMML patients. The CMML-0 group included 36.4% patients with higher risk CPSS categories and 11.2% of patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Among treatment-naive patients (n = 499), there was a marginal difference in OS between the CMML-0 and CMML-1(2017) subgroups (P = .0552). The WHO 2017 blast-based categories were not associated with AML-free survival. Incorporation of the WHO 2017 blast-based subgroups in a modified CPSS scheme had a neutral effect and did not improve its prognostic strength. Our data support the inclusion of MP-CMML and MDS-CMML subtypes in the WHO 2017 revision. Although of some utility in MP-CMML, the 3-tiered blast-based system is not well supported in this study.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Loghavi, Sanam', 'Sui, Dawen', 'Wei, Peng', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Routbort, Mark J', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Kanagal-Shamanna, Rashmi', 'Gur, H Deniz', 'Hu, Shimin', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Khoury, Joseph D']","['Loghavi S', 'Sui D', 'Wei P', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Pierce S', 'Routbort MJ', 'Jabbour EJ', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Kanagal-Shamanna R', 'Gur HD', 'Hu S', 'Zuo Z', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Khoury JD']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8980-3202', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4860-261X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1670-6513', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7829-5249', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7110-3814', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6577-8006', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2621-3584']","['Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Biostatistics, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Hematopathology.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/classification/diagnosis/mortality/therapy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*classification/diagnosis/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Assessment', 'Survival Rate', 'World Health Organization']",PMC6093727,,,,2018/07/29 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018019224 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019224 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Aug 14;2(15):1807-1816. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018019224.,15,1807-1816,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the complex ALL treatment regimen makes it difficult to isolate the causes of these side effects and impossible to separate the contributions of individual chemotherapy agents by clinical observation. Using a mouse model, we therefore assessed each of eight representative, systemically-administered ALL chemotherapy agents for their impact on postnatal brain development and heart function. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Mice were treated systemically with a single chemotherapy agent at an infant equivalent age, then allowed to age to early adulthood (9 weeks). Cardiac structure and function were assessed using in vivo high-frequency ultrasound, and brain anatomy was assessed using high-resolution volumetric ex vivo MRI. In addition, longitudinal in vivo MRI was used to determine the time course of developmental change after vincristine treatment. RESULTS: Vincristine, doxorubicin, and methotrexate were observed to produce the greatest deficiencies in brain development as determined by volumes measured on MRI, whereas doxorubicin, methotrexate, and l-asparaginase altered heart structure or function. Longitudinal studies of vincristine revealed widespread volume loss immediately following treatment and impaired growth over time in several brain regions. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple ALL chemotherapy agents can affect postnatal brain development or heart function. This study provides a ranking of agents based on potential toxicity, and thus highlights a subset likely to cause side effects in early adulthood for further study.",['(c)2018 American Association for Cancer Research.'],"['Spencer Noakes, T Leigh', 'Przybycien, Thomas S', 'Forwell, Amanda', 'Nicholls, Connor', 'Zhou, Yu-Qing', 'Butcher, Darci T', 'Weksberg, Rosanna', 'Guger, Sharon L', 'Spiegler, Brenda J', 'Schachar, Russell J', 'Hitzler, Johann', 'Ito, Shinya', 'van der Plas, Ellen', 'Nieman, Brian J']","['Spencer Noakes TL', 'Przybycien TS', 'Forwell A', 'Nicholls C', 'Zhou YQ', 'Butcher DT', 'Weksberg R', 'Guger SL', 'Spiegler BJ', 'Schachar RJ', 'Hitzler J', 'Ito S', 'van der Plas E', 'Nieman BJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2015-4395'],"['Mouse Imaging Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. leigh.spencernoakes@sickkids.ca.', 'Translational Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mouse Imaging Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mouse Imaging Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.', 'Mouse Imaging Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, Translational Biology and Engineering Program, The University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Haematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Genetics & Genome Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical and Metabolic Genetics, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute of Medical Sciences, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Molecular Genetics, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Psychiatry Research, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Translational Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Development and Stem Cell Biology, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Translational Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Medicine, The University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, The University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'Mouse Imaging Centre, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Translational Medicine, The Hospital for Sick Children Research Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Neurosciences and Mental Health, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180727,United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Brain/*drug effects/*growth & development', 'Brain Injuries/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Diseases/diagnostic imaging/*etiology/physiopathology', 'Heart Function Tests', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mice']",,,,,2018/07/29 06:00,2019/11/19 06:00,['2018/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-0551 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0551 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2018 Dec 1;24(23):6040-6052. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-0551.

Survival often differs by locus, but little is known about relative health care utilization and costs. We estimated these in a population-based cohort of adolescents. METHODS: All Ontario adolescents (15.0-17.9 years) diagnosed with cancer between 1995 and 2010 were identified from provincial cancer registries. We compared health care resource utilization (hospitalizations, emergency department visits, same-day surgeries, outpatient chemotherapy, radiation, diagnostic/laboratory tests, physician services, home care) and costs (2012 Canadian dollars) during four discrete care phases-prediagnosis (60 days), initial (360 days), continuing (variable), and terminal (360 days)-between adolescents treated in pediatric vs adult institutions, for the whole cohort and within seven diagnostic categories. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Of 1356 eligible adolescents, 691 and 665 were treated in adult and pediatric institutions, respectively. Hospitalization rates were higher in pediatric institutions during prediagnosis (14.9% vs 6.9%, P < .001), initial (95.1% vs 73.3%, P < .001), and continuing phases (43.2% vs 34.4%, P = .002), but similar (96.1% vs 96.3%, P = .93) during the terminal phase. Average length of stay was higher at pediatric institutions within most diagnoses and phases. For all diagnoses, median initial phase costs were higher in pediatric than adult institutions (eg, leukemia: $153 926 vs $102 418 per 360 days, P < .001; lymphoma: $65 025 vs $19 846, P < .001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The costs of caring for adolescents with the same malignancy are considerably higher in pediatric than adult institutions during most phases. Resource utilization, particularly hospitalization, drives much of the cost difference, making these data applicable to other jurisdictions.","['(c) The Author(s) 2018.

Recent studies suggest a role for pericytes in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microvascular dysfunction and mortality, but the mechanisms of pericyte loss in sepsis are largely unknown. Methods: By using a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced murine model of sepsis, we observed that CLP led to lung and renal pericyte loss and reduced lung pericyte density and pericyte/endothelial cell (EC) coverage. Results: Up-regulated Friend leukemia virus integration 1 (Fli-1) messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA) and protein levels were found in lung pericytes from CLP mice in vivo and in LPS-stimulated lung pericytes in vitro. Knockout of Fli-1 in Foxd1-derived pericytes prevented CLP-induced pericyte loss, vascular leak, and improved survival. Disrupted Fli-1 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in cultured lung pericytes. Furthermore, CLP-induced pericyte pyroptosis was mitigated in pericyte Fli-1 knockout mice.

We investigated the clinical features of secondary bone/soft tissue sarcoma among childhood cancer survivors (CCSs). Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-series study of 10 069 CCSs newly diagnosed with cancer between 1980 and 2009 across 15 Japanese hospitals. Twenty-one cases of pathologically diagnosed secondary bone/soft tissue sarcoma were selected, and the respective clinical courses were determined using additional questionnaires. Results: The primary cancers included retinoblastoma (n = 7), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 5), lymphoma (n = 5), osteosarcoma (n = 1), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 1), brain tumor (n = 1) and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (n = 1). The median age at the primary cancer diagnosis was 2.9 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 16:5. The histological classifications of the secondary sarcoma included osteosarcoma (n = 10), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (n = 4), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 3), Ewing's sarcoma (n = 3) and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (n = 1). The median latency period to the secondary sarcoma was 10.2 years. Significant risk factors for secondary sarcoma in the multivariate Cox regression model included a history of retinoblastoma as the primary cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 20.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.70-76.5) and autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) (HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.08-6.03). Seventeen CCSs with secondary sarcoma underwent radiation, and nine, hematopoietic SCT. Twelve CCSs with secondary sarcoma achieved disease-free survival, while CCSs with hematological cancer or relapsed primary cancer who developed secondary sarcoma had the worst prognoses.

The goal of this study was to define the relative sensitivities of commonly used stains for markers of megakaryocytic differentiation. Methods: The sensitivities of IHC stains for CD42b, CD61, and von Willebrand factor (vWF) were compared in 32 cases of pediatric AMKL. Results: The sensitivities of CD42b, CD61, and vWF were 90.6%, 78.1% and 62.5%, respectively. When CD42b and CD61 were used together, the combined sensitivity increased to 93.6%. There were no cases in which vWF was positive when both CD42b and CD61 were negative. Conclusions: CD42b can reliably be used as a solitary first-line marker for blasts of megakaryocytic lineage, whereas CD61 may be reserved for infrequent cases that are CD42b negative.

Chromosomal microarray can detect copy number aberrations (CNAs) with greater resolution when compared to G-banding and FISH, and can also identify copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH). The purpose of our review is to highlight a preselected group of hematologic neoplasms for which chromosomal microarray has the greatest clinical utility. Methods: A case-based approach and review of the literature was performed to identify the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing chromosomal microarray for specific hematologic neoplasms. Results: Chromosomal microarray identified CNAs and CN-LOH of clinical significance, and could be performed on fresh or paraffin-embedded tissue and liquid neoplasms.

However, some disadvantages still limit its full application potential, e.g., allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and blood clotting impairment. Therefore, much effort has been directed at improving its performance. A popular strategy is to randomly conjugate L-asparaginase with mono-methoxy polyethylene glycol, which became a commercial FDA approved formulation widely used in recent years. To improve this formulation by PEGylation, herein we performed cysteine-directed conjugation of the L-asparaginase subunits to prevent dissociation-induced loss of activity. The recombinant cysteine conjugation sites were introduced by mutagenesis at surface-exposed positions on the protein to avoid affecting the catalytic activity. Three conjugates were obtained using different linear PEGs of 1000, 2000, and 5000 g/mol, with physical properties ranging from a semi-solid gel to a fully soluble state. The soluble-conjugate exhibited higher catalytic activity than the non-conjugated mutant, and the same activity than the native enzyme. The cysteine-directed crosslinking of the L-asparaginase subunits produced a higher molecular weight conjugate compared to the native tetrameric enzyme. This strategy might improve L-asparaginase efficiency for leukemia treatment by reducing glomerular filtration due to the increase in hydrodynamic size thus extending half-live, while at the same time retaining full catalytic activity.",,"['Ramirez-Paz, Josell', 'Saxena, Manoj', 'Delinois, Louis J', 'Joaquin-Ovalle, Freisa M', 'Lin, Shiru', 'Chen, Zhongfang', 'Rojas-Nieves, Virginia A', 'Griebenow, Kai']","['Ramirez-Paz J', 'Saxena M', 'Delinois LJ', 'Joaquin-Ovalle FM', 'Lin S', 'Chen Z', 'Rojas-Nieves VA', 'Griebenow K']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0495-9932'],"['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Natural Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",20180727,United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Glycoconjugates)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Asparagine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Biocatalysis', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Cysteine/*chemistry', 'Gene Expression', 'Glycoconjugates/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Maleimides/chemistry', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation, alpha-Helical', 'Protein Conformation, beta-Strand', 'Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs', 'Protein Multimerization', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry']",PMC6063399,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],2018/07/28 06:00,2018/12/27 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0197643 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-13208 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2018 Jul 27;13(7):e0197643. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0197643. eCollection 2018.,7,e0197643,['R25 GM061151/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quiescent stem cells undergo rare asymmetric cell divisions (ACDs) through which they self-renew and give rise to tissue-committed ""progenitors"" of distinct fate and ""progenitors"" in turn undergo symmetric cell divisions (SCDs) and clonal expansion. However, quiescent stem cells have not been demonstrated in adult tissues such as skin, testis, liver, and brain. After surgical removal of part of liver and pancreas-adult differentiated cells divide and regenerate and a possible role of stem cells remains doubtful. Long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells are quiescent in nature but ACD has not been convincingly demonstrated even among them. Attempts by various groups to identify a common stemness program that ensures self-renewal among different kinds of stem cells have also remained futile. Uncontrolled self-renewal and compromised differentiation of stem cells possibly initiate leukemia/cancer, but the identity of leukemic stem cells and whether cancer stem cells arise by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in solid tumors are all open-ended questions that need greater clarity. Acceptance of the presence of very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs) in adult tissues could clarify several of these existing dilemmas in the field. Data are compiled showing that VSELs undergo ACD in the hematopoietic system, testis, ovary, uterus, and pancreas, whereas tissue-committed progenitors undergo SCD and clonal expansion. VSELs possess similar overlapping stemness program as in embryonic stem cells, embryonic carcinoma cells, embryonic germ cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, and primordial germ cells. VSELs and leukemic and cancer cells express overlapping embryonic markers. Uncontrolled proliferation of VSELs and compromised differentiation possibly initiate leukemia. Process of EMT and initiation of solid tumor from VSELs (located among the epithelial cells) are indeed two distinct and parallel events. To conclude, VSELs provide explanation to several confounding aspects of adult stem cell biology.",,"['Bhartiya, Deepa', 'Patel, Hiren', 'Ganguly, Ranita', 'Shaikh, Ambreen', 'Shukla, Yashvi', 'Sharma, Diksha', 'Singh, Pushpa']","['Bhartiya D', 'Patel H', 'Ganguly R', 'Shaikh A', 'Shukla Y', 'Sharma D', 'Singh P']",,"['Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, ICMR-National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health , Mumbai, India .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180829,United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,,IM,"['Adult Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Asymmetric Cell Division/*genetics', 'Brain/cytology/growth & development', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Cell Self Renewal/genetics', 'Clone Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/growth & development', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Pancreas/cytology/growth & development', 'Regeneration/*genetics', 'Skin/cytology/growth & development', 'Testis/cytology/growth & development']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adult stem cells', '*asymmetric cell divisions', '*cancer stem cells', '*quiescence', '*self-renewal', '*very small embryonic-like stem cells']",,2018/07/28 06:00,2019/09/24 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/24 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2018.0118 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2018 Nov 15;27(22):1527-1539. doi: 10.1089/scd.2018.0118.

PATIENTS: All children in Hong Kong diagnosed with ALL with TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement over the past two decades were included. METHODS: Six hundred and twenty-four newly diagnosed patients with ALL from four consecutive studies were enrolled from 1997 to 2016. Patients carrying TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement and patients at intermediate risk without the gene expression were compared for clinical characteristics, overall survival and event-free survival (EFS). RESULTS: The TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement was detected in 30 of 624 patients (4.8%). Results were consistent across the consecutive clinical trials employed in the past two decades. Compared with 239 intermediate risk patients without TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement, the 5-year overall survival and EFS for patients with TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement was superior, with both at 100% (P = 0.12 and P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: This population-based study over the past 20 years demonstrated that patients with TCF3-PBX1 rearrangement had favourable EFS compared with other intermediate risk patients treated with a similar chemotherapy backbone.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Lin, Anna', 'Cheng, Frankie W T', 'Chiang, Alan K S', 'Luk, Chung-Wing', 'Li, Rever C H', 'Ling, Alvin S C', 'Cheuk, Daniel K L', 'Chang, Kai-On', 'Ku, Dennis', 'Lee, Vincent', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Li, Chi-Kong']","['Lin A', 'Cheng FWT', 'Chiang AKS', 'Luk CW', 'Li RCH', 'Ling ASC', 'Cheuk DKL', 'Chang KO', 'Ku D', 'Lee V', 'Ha SY', 'Li CK']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0216-4386', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0948-9132', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2810-5758']","['Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Tuen Mun Hospital, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Prince of Wales Hospital, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180726,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TCF3-PBX1 fusion protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*EFS', '*TCF3-PBX1', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*survival', '*t(1;19)']",,2018/07/28 06:00,2019/05/08 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27346 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Dec;65(12):e27346. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27346.

Nevertheless, subtle DNA sequence changes, namely short insertions/deletions, may also abolish the expression of HLA molecules and interfere with routine HLA typing. Two male patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) were indicated for the search of a suitable donor for allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT). The patients and their relatives were initially HLA typed by serological and DNA techniques at a low-resolution level. The HLA high-resolution (HR) type was obtained by means of sequencing-based typing (SBT). In both cases, anomalous frameshifts in the sequence were observed in the HLA-B gene, namely in exon 3 (Case 1, heterozygous deletion of two bases) and exon 4 (Case 2, heterozygous insertion of two bases). In the second case, the insertion variant was associated with a loss of HLA-B8 expression. To reveal whether these sequence patterns may be caused by somatic mutations in the malignant cells, blood sample in remission (Case 1) and buccal swab sample (Case 2) were collected from the patients. In an important manner, the SBT in these germline samples revealed common HLA-B*07:02,*15:01 (Case 1) and HLA-B*08:01,*35:02 (Case 2) types with no evidence for the sequence alteration observed in the initial samples. In conclusion, the insertion/deletion sequence variants of the HLA-B gene in two patients were limited to the initial blood samples with a substantial proportion of AML cells and thus may be attributed to the somatic mutation in the malignant cells. HLA somatic mutations should be taken into account in patients with haematological malignancies to prevent HLA mistyping and inappropriate selection of an aHSCT donor.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Konigova, Nikola', 'Skoumalova, Ivana', 'Onderkova, Jana', 'Ambruzova, Zuzana', 'Szotkowski, Tomas', 'Koristek, Zdenek', 'Maluskova, Alena', 'Raida, Ludek', 'Mrazek, Frantisek']","['Konigova N', 'Skoumalova I', 'Onderkova J', 'Ambruzova Z', 'Szotkowski T', 'Koristek Z', 'Maluskova A', 'Raida L', 'Mrazek F']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9981-7517'],"['Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology, University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'Medical Faculty, Ostrava University, Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'Blood Centre, University Hospital, Ostrava, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haemato-oncology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Olomouc, Czech Republic.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University, Olomouc, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180727,England,Int J Immunogenet,International journal of immunogenetics,101232337,"['0 (HLA-B*07:02 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B*08:01 antigen)', '0 (HLA-B7 Antigen)', '0 (HLA-B8 Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['HLA-B7 Antigen/*genetics', 'HLA-B8 Antigen/*genetics', 'Humans', '*INDEL Mutation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA', 'allograft/allogeneic transplantation', 'cancer - leukaemia/haematologic', 'immune response']",,2018/07/28 06:00,2019/02/06 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/25 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/iji.12393 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Immunogenet. 2018 Dec;45(6):323-328. doi: 10.1111/iji.12393.

It divides patients into five categories including an intermediate subset (IPSS-R int-risk). Outcomes and clinical interventions for patients with IPSS-R int-risk are not well defined. We performed an analysis of outcomes of this group of patients. Out of 3167 patients, a total of 298 were identified with IPSS-R int-risk MDS and retrospectively analyzed to assess characteristics affecting outcomes. Cox proportional hazard models for overall survival (OS) were performed to identify statistically significant clinical factors that influence survival. Age of 66 years or greater, peripheral blood blasts of 2% or more, and history of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion were significantly associated with inferior survival. Based on these features, MDS patients with IPSS-R int-risk were classified into two prognostic risk groups for analysis, an int-favorable group and an int-adverse group, and had significantly divergent outcomes. Sequential prognostication was validated using two independent datasets comprising over 700 IPSS-R int-risk patients. The difference in median survival between int-favorable and int-adverse patients was 3.7 years in the test cohort, and 1.8 and 2.0 years in the two validation cohorts. These results confirm significantly variable outcomes of patients with IPSS-R int-risk and need for different prognostic systems.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Benton, Christopher B', 'Khan, Maliha', 'Sallman, David', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Nogueras Gonzalez, Graciela M', 'Piao, Jin', 'Ning, Jing', 'Aung, Fleur', 'Al Ali, Najla', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Kadia, Tapan M', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Steensma, David', 'DeZern, Amy', 'Roboz, Gail', 'Sekeres, Mikkael', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Komrokji, Rami S', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Benton CB', 'Khan M', 'Sallman D', 'Nazha A', 'Nogueras Gonzalez GM', 'Piao J', 'Ning J', 'Aung F', 'Al Ali N', 'Jabbour E', 'Kadia TM', 'Borthakur G', 'Ravandi F', 'Pierce S', 'Steensma D', 'DeZern A', 'Roboz G', 'Sekeres M', 'Andreeff M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Komrokji RS', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3645-148X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4516-3837', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7679-6453', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1876-5269']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate (1) the impact of an AS intervention on antibiotic consumption and (2) the applicability and acceptance rate of the intervention and its clinical impact. A persuasive AS intervention based on European Conference on Infection in Leukaemia (ECIL) guidelines for FN was implemented in a high-risk hematology ward in a tertiary referral public university hospital. This included the creation and diffusion of flow charts on de-escalation and discontinuation of antibiotics for FN, and the introduction in the team of a doctor dedicated to the implementation of flow charts and to antibiotic prescription revision. All consecutive patients receiving antibiotics during hospitalization were included. A segmented linear regression model was performed for the evaluation of antibiotic consumption, taking into account 1-year pre-intervention period and 6-month intervention period. Overall, 137 consecutive antibiotic prescriptions were re-evaluated, 100 prescriptions were for FN. A significant reduction of the level of carbapenem consumption was observed during the intervention period (level change (estimate coefficient +/- standard error) = - 135.28 +/- 59.49; p = 0.04). Applicability and acceptability of flow charts were high. No differences in terms of intensive care unit transfers, bacteremia incidence, and mortality were found. A persuasive AS intervention in hematology significantly reduced carbapenem consumption without affecting outcome and was well accepted.

Tigecycline has an expanded antibacterial activity spectrum; some successful cases of tigecycline treatment have been reported in the literature. Objective To examine the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in children. Setting Department of hematologic malignancies in a tertiary hospital. Method A retrospective chart review from May 1, 2012 to May 1, 2017. The patients were identified by the hospital information system and a custom-made Microsoft Excel 2007 database of patients was created to record demographic and medical data. Main outcome measure Efficacy and safety of tigecycline use in severe infection children with hematologic malignancies. Results Thirty-seven patients were enrolled and the predominant diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The median duration of tigecycline therapy was 9 days. Most prescriptions were empirical. Eighteen patients received a maintenance dose of 2 mg/kg q12 h, without a loading dose. Sulperazone was the most frequently prescribed concomitant drug. At the end of tigecycline therapy, improvement was observed in 48.7% of cases. After treatment, interleukin-10 levels notably decreased. The only reported adverse event was a case of tooth discoloration. Conclusion Tigecycline can be used as salvage therapy in children with hematologic malignancy and seems tolerable.

Although uncommon, these tumors are iatrogenic, and vaccination against rabies and feline leukemia virus is perhaps the most common inciting cause. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but it is widely accepted that inflammation induced by vaccines or other injections likely plays a critical role in tumor development. Injection site sarcomas are extremely locally invasive. Multimodal therapy, incorporating combinations of surgery, radiation therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy or immunotherapy, is recommended. However, tumor recurrences are common even with aggressive treatment, and many cats with FISS ultimately succumb to this devastating disease. While vaccination protocols play an important role in the management and control of infectious disease, veterinarians must be diligent in following established vaccination guidelines to minimize individual patient risk of FISS development.

NCAM 120 contains no intracellular domain, whereas NCAM 140 and 180 have different intracellular domains determined by alternative splicing of exon 18. NCAM has been described as a biomarker to discriminate small cell lung cancer (SCLC) from non-SCLC (NSCLC). However, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) also express NCAM. We studied the expression of NCAM splice variants in cell lines, tumor tissues and control cells. Methods: Using reverse transcriptase-PCR we evaluated the expression of NCAM exon 18 splice variants in lung cancers cell lines, control cell lines, PBMC of healthy controls and SCLC tissue. In addition we studied the expression of the NCAM exon 18 encoded protein (E18) in SCLC by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry using an E18-specific monoclonal antibody obtained by hybridoma fusion of E18-immunized mouse spleen cells. Finally we looked at immune responses to E18 in mice. Results: We found expression of RNA encoding the NCAM 180 variant in all SCLC cell lines. NCAM exon 18 was not expressed in 23/28 (82%) of the other tumor and leukemia cell lines tested and PBMC. Next, we also evaluated the expression of NCAM exon 18 in human SCLC tissue. Expression of NCAM exon 18 in 8 of the 10 (80%) SCLC biopsy samples was found. The newly raised E18-specific antibodies stained NCAM at the adherent junctions between adjacent cells in SCLC cell lines. The data demonstrate the intracellular location of E18 in SCLC. Furthermore, a specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response and significant antibody titers were found in mice upon immunization with recombinant E18 and its encoding DNA. Conclusions: The results of this study can be applied in the diagnosis and immunotherapy of SCLC. A larger study investigating E18 as a marker for SCLC is indicated.",,"['Vander Borght, Ann', 'Duysinx, Mieke', 'Broers, Jos L V', 'Ummelen, Monique', 'Falkenberg, Frank W', 'Hahnel, Christine', 'van der Zeijst, Bernard A M']","['Vander Borght A', 'Duysinx M', 'Broers JLV', 'Ummelen M', 'Falkenberg FW', 'Hahnel C', 'van der Zeijst BAM']",,"['Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'MUbio Products BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'MUbio Products BV, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Genetics and Cell Biology, GROW School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht University Medical Center, Maastricht, The Netherlands.', 'CIRES GmbH, Dortmund, Germany.', 'CIRES GmbH, Dortmund, Germany.', 'Catherinn B.V., Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,China,Transl Lung Cancer Res,Translational lung cancer research,101646875,,,,PMC6037973,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunotherapy', 'NCAM exon 18', 'alternative splicing', 'small cell lung cancer (SCLC)', 'tumor marker']",['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],2018/07/28 06:00,2018/07/28 06:01,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/tlcr.2018.03.03 [doi]', 'tlcr-07-03-376 [pii]']",ppublish,Transl Lung Cancer Res. 2018 Jun;7(3):376-388. doi: 10.21037/tlcr.2018.03.03.,3,376-388,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives: To determine the HTLV-1/2 seroprevalence in two Brazilian communities in northern Brazil. Methods: In 2010 and 2015, HTLV-1/2 serological surveys were carried out in the Oiapoque county at the Brazilian border with French Guiana and in Santa Cruz do Arari, Marajo Island. Serum and breast-milk samples from 317 women (pregnant, lactating and non-pregnant non-lactating) resident in the Oiapoque county, together with serum samples from 217 females and 70 males living in Santa Cruz do Arari county, were twice screened by two distinct commercial immunoassay methods for antibodies to HTLV-1/2. Seroreactivity was confirmed by a commercial Western blot technique. Participants were interviewed for data concerning their health, socioeconomic and educational status. Results: None of the Oiapoque women, mostly young and descendants of migrants, had antibodies to HTLV-1/2, despite the high HTLV-1 prevalence in neighbouring French Guiana and Caribbean Islands, while five females and three males living in Santa Cruz do Arari county were HTLV-1 infected as confirmed by Western blot testing. In contrast, the Santa Cruz do Arari community lives in relative isolation and is descended mostly from black African people with high consanguinity.

The Mahalanobis distance takes into account the dispersion of the data and the correlation between the variables. It differs from Euclidean distance in that it considers the variance and correlation of the dataset. The robustness of the method is tested using synthetic data and a benchmark database.

As long as the field develops exponentially, new relationships between certain gammadelta T cell subsets, on one hand, and their BTN/BTNL counterparts mainly present on epithelial and tumor cells, on the other, are described in the scientific literature. Btnl1/Btnl6 in mice and BTNL3/BTNL8 in humans regulate the homing and maturation of Vgamma7+ and Vgamma4+ T cells to the gut epithelium. Similarly, Skint-1 has shown to shape the dendritic epidermal T cells repertoire and their activation levels in mice. We and others have identified BTN3A proteins are the key mediators of phosphoantigen sensing by human Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells. Here, we first synthesize the modulation of specific gammadelta T cell subsets by related BTN/BTNL molecules, in human and mice. Then, we focus on the role of BTN3A in the activation of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cells, and we highlight the recent advances in the understanding of the expression, regulation, and function of BTN3A in tumor immunity. Hence, recent studies demonstrated that several signals induced by cancer cells or their microenvironment can regulate the expression of BTN3A. Moreover, antibodies targeting BTN3A have shown in vitro and in vivo efficacy in human tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia or pancreatic cancer. We thus finally discuss how these findings could help develop novel gammadelta T cell-based immunotherapeutical approaches.",,"['Blazquez, Juan-Luis', 'Benyamine, Audrey', 'Pasero, Christine', 'Olive, Daniel']","['Blazquez JL', 'Benyamine A', 'Pasero C', 'Olive D']",,"['INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Immunity & Cancer, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, CNRS UMR 7258, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite (AMU), Medecine Interne Hopital Nord, Assistance Publique Hopitaux de Marseille (AP-HM), Marseille, France.', 'Imcheck Therapeutics, Marseille, France.', 'INSERM, U1068, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Immunity & Cancer, Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille Universite UM105, CNRS UMR 7258, Marseille, France.', 'Immunomonitoring platform, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180711,Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,PMC6050389,['NOTNLM'],"['BTN3A', 'butyrophilins', 'immunotherapy', 'tumor immunity', 'gammadelta T cells']",,2018/07/28 06:00,2018/07/28 06:01,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2018.01601 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2018 Jul 11;9:1601. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2018.01601. eCollection 2018.,,1601,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In FTLD, both nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions with wild-type FUS exist, while cytoplasmic inclusions with a mutant-form of FUS occur in many ALS cases. These observations imply that FUS plays a role across these two diseases. In this study, we examined the effect of several proteins including molecular chaperons on the aberrant eye morphology phenotype induced by overexpression of wild-type human FUS (hFUS) in Drosophila eye imaginal discs. By screening, we found that the co-expression of nucleophosmin-human myeloid leukemia factor 1 (NPM-hMLF1) fusion protein could suppress the aberrant eye morphology phenotype induced by hFUS. The driving of hFUS expression at 28 degrees C down-regulated levels of hFUS and endogenous cabeza, a Drosophila homolog of hFUS. The down-regulation was mediated by proteasome dependent degradation. Co-expression of NPM-hMLF1 suppressed this down-regulation. In addition, co-expression of NPM-hMLF1 partially rescued pharate adult lethal phenotype induced by hFUS in motor neurons.

We demonstrate that timely removal of CD71 is coupled with mitochondrial clearance, which can be disrupted by null mutation of immediate early response gene X-1 (IEX-1), leading to generation of aberrant CD71-positive and mitochondria-negative (CD71(+)Mito(-)) reticulocytes. CD71(+)Mito(-) reticulocytes were also present in a subset of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in direct proportion to reduced mitochondrial membrane potential (psim). Mitochondrial abnormality caused by either IEX-1 deficiency or agents that dissipate psim could trigger premature clearance of mitochondria in reticulocytes. Premature clearance of mitochondria or addition of anti-oxidants lowered intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn hindered CD71 shedding and reticulocyte maturation. In contrast, introduction of ROS accelerated CD71 shedding via release of exosomes that contained a high proportion of Fe(3+) over Fe(2+), suggesting dual functions of CD71 shedding both in removal of toxic Fe(3+) from reticulocytes and in limiting importation of Fe(3+) into the cells.

Since the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs), several studies have shown their significant role in the regulation of the hematopoietic system. Impaired expression of miRNAs leads to disrupted cellular pathways and in particular causes loss of hematopoietic ability. Here, we report a previously unrecognized function of miR-143 in granulopoiesis. Hematopoietic cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation exhibited increased miR-143 expression. Overexpression or ablation of miR-143 expression resulted in accelerated granulocytic differentiation or block of differentiation, respectively. The absence of miR-143 in mice resulted in a reduced number of mature granulocytes in blood and bone marrow. Additionally, we observed an association of high miR-143 expression levels with a higher probability of survival in two different cohorts of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Overexpression of miR-143 in AML cells impaired cell growth, partially induced differentiation, and caused apoptosis. Argonaute2-RNA-Immunoprecipitation assay revealed ERK5, a member of the MAPK-family, as a target of miR-143 in myeloid cells. Further, we observed an inverse correlation of miR-143 and ERK5 in primary AML patient samples, and in CD34(+) HSPCs undergoing granulocytic differentiation and we confirmed functional relevance of ERK5 in myeloid cells. In conclusion, our data describe miR-143 as a relevant factor in granulocyte differentiation, whose expression may be useful as a prognostic and therapeutic factor in AML therapy.",,"['Hartmann, Jens-Uwe', 'Brauer-Hartmann, Daniela', 'Kardosova, Miroslava', 'Wurm, Alexander A', 'Wilke, Franziska', 'Schodel, Cindy', 'Gerloff, Dennis', 'Katzerke, Christiane', 'Krakowsky, Rosanna', 'Namasu, Carolina Yaeko', 'Bill, Marius', 'Schwind, Sebastian', 'Muller-Tidow, Carsten', 'Niederwieser, Dietger', 'Alberich-Jorda, Meritxell', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Hartmann JU', 'Brauer-Hartmann D', 'Kardosova M', 'Wurm AA', 'Wilke F', 'Schodel C', 'Gerloff D', 'Katzerke C', 'Krakowsky R', 'Namasu CY', 'Bill M', 'Schwind S', 'Muller-Tidow C', 'Niederwieser D', 'Alberich-Jorda M', 'Behre G']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Leipzig University Hospital, Leipzig, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics of the ASCR, v.v.i.

In contrast, generic and automated analytical workflows for discovery of such pharmacodynamic markers, in particular lipid markers, and their use in cellular tests of drug-like compounds are still lacking. Here, we introduce such a workflow and demonstrate its utility for cellular drug-response monitoring of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors in K562 leukemia cells: First, low-molecular mass features indicating drug responses are computationally extracted from groups of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Then, the lipids/metabolites corresponding to these features are identified by MALDI-Fourier transformation mass spectrometry. To demonstrate utility of the method, we identify the potassium adduct of phosphatidylcholine PC(36:1) as well as heme B, a marker for erythroid differentiation, as markers for a label-free MALDI MS-based test of cellular responses to BCR-ABL inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of lipids and other low molecular mass metabolites could support cell-based drug profiling.",,"['Weigt, David', 'Sammour, Denis A', 'Ulrich, Timon', 'Munteanu, Bogdan', 'Hopf, Carsten']","['Weigt D', 'Sammour DA', 'Ulrich T', 'Munteanu B', 'Hopf C']",,"['Center for biomedical Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Paul-Wittsack Str. 10, 68163, Mannheim, Germany.', 'HBIGS International Graduate School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 501, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for biomedical Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Paul-Wittsack Str. 10, 68163, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Center for biomedical Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Paul-Wittsack Str. 10, 68163, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Center for biomedical Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Paul-Wittsack Str. 10, 68163, Mannheim, Germany.', 'Center for biomedical Mass Spectrometry and Optical Spectroscopy (CeMOS), Mannheim University of Applied Sciences, Paul-Wittsack Str. 10, 68163, Mannheim, Germany. carsten.hopf@medtech.uni-heidelberg.de.', 'HBIGS International Graduate School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 501, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany. carsten.hopf@medtech.uni-heidelberg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180726,England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biological Factors/*analysis', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization/*methods', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared/methods']",PMC6062520,,,,2018/07/28 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-018-29677-z [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-018-29677-z [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2018 Jul 26;8(1):11260. doi: 10.1038/s41598-018-29677-z.,1,11260,"['INST 874/7-1 FUGG/Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research', 'Foundation)/International', 'NANOKAT II - Netzwerk Biotechnologie/Bundesministerium f&amp;#x00FC;r Bildung und', 'Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)/International']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this project we aimed to identify genes responsible for the observed differences in outcome that are common to both RUNX1 alterations. Analyzing four AML gene expression data sets (n = 1514), a total of 80 patients with RUNX1/RUNX1T1 and 156 patients with point mutations in RUNX1 were compared. Using the statistical tool of mediation analysis we identified the genes CD109, HOPX, and KIAA0125 as candidates for mediator genes. In an analysis of an independent validation cohort, KIAA0125 again showed a significant influence with respect to the impact of the RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion. While there were no significant results for the other two genes in this smaller validation cohort, the observed relations linked with mediation effects (i.e., those between alterations, gene expression and survival) were almost without exception as strong as in the main analysis.

Previously, microRNA expression profiling showed deregulated expression of miR-150 and miR-155 in CML. In this study, we placed these findings into the broader context of the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU.1 oncogenic network. We propose that up-regulated MYC and miR-155 in CD34(+) leukemic stem and progenitor cells, in concert with BCR-ABL1, impair the molecular mechanisms of myeloid differentiation associated with low miR-150 and PU.1 levels. We revealed that MYC directly occupied the -11.7 kb and -0.35 kb regulatory regions in the MIR150 gene. MYC occupancy was markedly increased through BCR-ABL1 activity, causing inhibition of MIR150 gene expression in CML CD34(+) and CD34(-) cells. Furthermore, we found an association between reduced miR-150 levels in CML blast cells and their resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Although TKIs successfully disrupted BCR-ABL1 kinase activity in proliferating CML cells, this treatment did not efficiently target quiescent leukemic stem cells. The study presents new evidence regarding the MYC/miR-150/MYB/miR-155/PU.1 leukemic network established by aberrant BCR-ABL1 activity. The key connecting nodes of this network may serve as potential druggable targets to overcome resistance of CML stem and progenitor cells.",['Copyright(c) 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.'],"['Srutova, Klara', 'Curik, Nikola', 'Burda, Pavel', 'Savvulidi, Filipp', 'Silvestri, Giovannino', 'Trotta, Rossana', 'Klamova, Hana', 'Pecherkova, Pavla', 'Sovova, Zofie', 'Koblihova, Jitka', 'Stopka, Tomas', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Polakova, Katerina Machova']","['Srutova K', 'Curik N', 'Burda P', 'Savvulidi F', 'Silvestri G', 'Trotta R', 'Klamova H', 'Pecherkova P', 'Sovova Z', 'Koblihova J', 'Stopka T', 'Perrotti D', 'Polakova KM']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Pathological Physiology, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medicine, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'BIOCEV, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Vestec, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Medicine, Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Maryland Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Prague, Czech Republic katerina.machova@uhkt.cz.', 'Institute of Clinical and Experimental Hematology, First Medical Faculty, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180726,Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (MIRN150 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology']",PMC6269310,,,,2018/07/28 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/03/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.193086 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.193086 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2018 Dec;103(12):2016-2025. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.193086.

How 5mC deamination contributes to cancer risk in different tissues remains unclear. Genomic profiling of 3 early-onset acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) identified germ line loss of MBD4 as an initiator of 5mC-dependent hypermutation. MBD4-deficient AMLs display a 33-fold higher mutation burden than AML generally, with >95% being C>T in the context of a CG dinucleotide. This distinctive signature was also observed in sporadic cancers that acquired biallelic mutations in MBD4 and in Mbd4 knockout mice. Sequential sampling of germ line cases demonstrated repeated expansion of blood cell progenitors with pathogenic mutations in DNMT3A, a key driver gene for both clonal hematopoiesis and AML. Our findings reveal genetic and epigenetic factors that shape the mutagenic influence of 5mC.

Here, we reveal a mechanism by which the small GTPase RhoB controls membrane blebbing and blebby amoeboid migration. Interestingly, while all three Rho isoforms (RhoA, RhoB and RhoC) regulated amoeboid migration, each controlled motility in a distinct manner. In particular, RhoB depletion blocked membrane blebbing in ALL (acute lymphoblastic leukaemia), melanoma and lung cancer cells as well as ALL cell amoeboid migration in 3D-collagen, while RhoB overexpression enhanced blebbing and 3D-collagen migration in a manner dependent on its plasma membrane localization and down-stream effectors ROCK and Myosin II RhoB localization was controlled by endosomal trafficking, being internalized via Rab5 vesicles and then trafficked either to late endosomes/lysosomes or to Rab11-positive recycling endosomes, as regulated by KIF13A. Importantly, KIF13A depletion not only inhibited RhoB plasma membrane localization, but also cell membrane blebbing and 3D-migration of ALL cells. In conclusion, KIF13A-mediated endosomal trafficking modulates RhoB plasma membrane localization to control membrane blebbing and blebby amoeboid migration.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

The blood-forming stem cells were used to restore healthy blood cells for the twin with leukemia. It was not until 1968 that genetic matching (known as human leukocyte antigen matching) was known to be important, and not until 1973 that bone marrow transplants were performed from non-twin-related and nonrelated donors. The most important application of human stem cells is for the generation of cells and tissues for cell-based therapies. Currently, donated organs and tissues are often the only option to replace diseased, injured, or destroyed tissue. The availability for these transplantable tissues and organs is very limited, however. To satisfy the demand for a source for these cells and tissues, induced pluripotent stem cells that have been differentiated into specific cell types can serve as a renewable source of replacement cells and tissues. A bank of suitable human leukocyte antigen-matched cells will be an important source providing immediate availability of cells that are readily scalable, economical, and well characterized. Areas of active pursuit with stem cell therapy is being investigated for treating diseases such as macular degeneration, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Current literature provides conflicting recommendations on whether an empiric tacrolimus dose reduction is necessary when coadministered with isavuconazole. A 47-year-old African American female with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent an allogenic stem cell transplant (alloSCT) and was subsequently placed on routine posttransplant therapy including tacrolimus for immunosuppression and posaconazole for antifungal prophylaxis. Tacrolimus was empirically dose reduced due to the expected DDI with posaconazole based on current recommendations. Due to a persistently prolonged QTc interval and need for mold coverage, antifungal prophylaxis was ultimately changed to isavuconazole at standard recommended dosing. Tacrolimus was empirically dose reduced by 40% based on limited available literature at the time; however, tacrolimus trough concentrations subsequently declined, requiring an increase in tacrolimus dose to maintain therapeutic trough concentrations. Adequate isavuconazole absorption was documented through pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data by measuring an isavuconazole trough concentration and directly observing isavuconazole's shortening effect on the QTc interval, respectively. Our experience in an alloSCT patient suggests that an empiric tacrolimus dose reduction is not required when isavuconazole is initiated, but close tacrolimus therapeutic drug monitoring should rather be performed to guide tacrolimus dosing.",,"['Kufel, Wesley D', 'Armistead, Paul M', 'Daniels, Lindsay M', 'Ptachcinski, Jonathan R', 'Alexander, Maurice D', 'Shaw, J Ryan']","['Kufel WD', 'Armistead PM', 'Daniels LM', 'Ptachcinski JR', 'Alexander MD', 'Shaw JR']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7703-096X'],"['Department of Pharmacy Practice, Binghamton University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Binghamton, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Upstate University Hospital, Syracuse, NY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education, University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education, University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education, University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina Medical Center, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.', 'Department of Practice Advancement and Clinical Education, University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",20180726,United States,J Pharm Pract,Journal of pharmacy practice,8900945,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '60UTO373KE (isavuconazole)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Allografts', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Tapering', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitriles/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Tacrolimus/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['drug interaction', 'isavuconazole', 'isavuconazonium sulfate', 'stem cell transplant', 'tacrolimus']",,2018/07/28 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2018/07/28 06:00'],"['2018/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/0897190018790688 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;33(2):226-230. doi: 10.1177/0897190018790688.

Cytogenetic analysis in acute leukemia is now routinely used to assist patient management, particularly in terms of diagnosis, disease monitoring, prognosis and risk stratification. Knowing about cytogenetic profile at the time of diagnosis is important in order to take critical decisions in management of these patients. The study was conducted to determine the distribution of cytogenetic abnormalities in Pakistani adult patients with AML in order to have insights regarding behavior of the disease. Methods: A retrospective analysis of all the cases of AML (>/=15years old) diagnosed at Aga Khan University from January 2011 to December 2016 was performed. Cytogenetic analysis was made for all cases using the trypsin-Giemsa banding technique. Karyotypes were interpreted using the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (ISCN) criteria. Results: A total of 321 patients were diagnosed with AML during the study period, of which 288 samples successfully yielded metaphase chromosomes. The male to female ratio was 1.7:1. A normal karyotype was present in 61% (n=176) of the cases whereas, 39% (n=112) had an abnormal karyotype. Of the abnormal cases, t (8;21) (q22;q22) and t (15;17) (q22;q12) were identified in 8.3% and 4.9% cases respectively. Adverse prognostic cytogenetic subgroups including complex karyotype, monosomy 7 and t(6;9)(p23;q34) were identified in 9%, 1% and 0.7% patients respectively. Conclusions: This largest cytogenetic data in adult AML from Pakistan showed comparable prevalence of favorable prognostic karyotype to international data. The prevalence of specific adverse prognostic karyotype was low.",['Creative Commons Attribution License'],"['Shaikh, Muhammad Shariq', 'Ahmed, Zeeshan Ansar', 'Shaikh, Mohammad Usman', 'Adil, Salman Naseem', 'Khurshid, Mohammad', 'Moatter, Tariq', 'Rashid, Anila', 'Karim, Farheen', 'Raheem, Ahmed', 'Ali, Natasha']","['Shaikh MS', 'Ahmed ZA', 'Shaikh MU', 'Adil SN', 'Khurshid M', 'Moatter T', 'Rashid A', 'Karim F', 'Raheem A', 'Ali N']",,"['Section of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Aga Khan University Hospital, Stadium Road, 74800, Karachi, Pakistan.

To improve the stability and homogeneity of the ADCs, a humanized anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (RC58) was developed in the present study. RC58 was based on the CD19 antigen as a potential molecular target of human B-cell lymphomas. RC58 has high CD19-binding affinity and can be internalized in CD19-positive cells through endocytosis. Furthermore, three types of RC58-based ADCs (ADC-1, ADC-2, and ADC-3) were generated using three kinds of Maleimide-PEG-based linkers with two different cytotoxins. The anti-tumor activities of the ADCs were confirmed by in vitro and in vivo experiments. The stability of the ADCs was also evaluated by incubation in human plasma for 10days. In vitro experiments showed that the three ADCs had distinct inhibitory effects on several B-lymphoma cell lines. Meanwhile, a close correlation between efficacy and drug concentration was found in a nude mouse xenograft model of human B-cell lymphoma, after treatment with RC58-based ADCs. Our results suggest that ADC-1, with high efficiency, could be used as a potential therapeutic agent for human B-cell malignancies.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, real world data on its incidence and survival at the population level remains sparse. METHODS: Using Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER-18) database, we identified patients aged >/=20 years with pathologically confirmed t-MN diagnosed between the years 2001-2014 and actively followed. Incidence rate per 100,000 population and incidence rate ratio (IRR) were calculated. Overall survival (OS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method with determinants analyzed by Cox proportional hazard regression method. RESULTS: A total of 1093 patients with a median age of 65 years were identified. Overall incidence of t-MN was 0.13 cases/100,000 population and showed significant variations with age, race and the period of diagnosis. Two year OS significantly declined with increasing age (51.3% in age group 20-39, 33.9% in age group 40-59, 19.3% in age group 60-79 and 0% in age >/= 80, p<0.01). OS has improved over period (year 2001-2007 - 22.1% vs. year 2008-2014 -26.9%, p=0.01). On multivariate analysis, increasing age was associated with significantly higher mortality. Compared to the period 2001-2007, a significantly lower risk for mortality was seen in the period 2008-2014 (HR 0.73, CI 0.58-0.92, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of t-MN has significantly increased in the last decade. Although OS at the population level is improving over time, outcomes of this disorder continue to remain poor, highlighting the need for novel therapies.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

It is therefore likely that dendritic cells (DCs) are among the first potential targets for HTLV-1. However, it remains unclear how DCs contribute to virus transmission and dissemination in the early stages of infection. We show that an HTLV-1-infected cell line (MT-2) and naturally infected CD4(+) T cells transfer p19(+) viral particles to the surface of allogeneic DCs via cell-to-cell contacts. Similarly organized cell-to-cell contacts also facilitate DC-mediated transfer of HTLV-1 to autologous CD4(+) T cells. These findings shed light on the cellular structures involved in anterograde and retrograde transmission and suggest a key role for DCs in the natural history and pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

The expression level of P-gp on the leukemia cell surface detected by cyclic voltammetry is in good agreement with immunofluorescence microscopy studies. The proposed biosensor could be used for the detection of P-gp expressing cells within a linear range of 1.5x10(3)cells/mL - 1.5x10(7)cells/mL where lowest detection limit is found to be 19cells/mL.

With rapid development of CAR-T therapies, a systematic method is needed to identify and monitor symptoms of neurotoxicity, elucidate potential etiologies, and compare toxicity across trials. This paper presents a systematic evaluation developed and used to prospectively assess neurotoxicity in our phase I anti-CD22 CAR-T-cell trial and describes the symptoms of neurotoxicity identified using this methodology. Central nervous system (CNS) studies included routine lumbar punctures performed for disease evaluation pretherapy and posttherapy and a baseline brain MRI. Brief cognitive evaluations, assessing 4 domains (attention, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and processing speed), were administered preinfusion and postinfusion. A newly developed CAR-T-specific neurological symptom checklist (NSC) was completed by caregivers at 3 designated time-points. Serial serum cytokine levels were compared with neurotoxicity symptoms and severity. The majority of the first 22 consecutively treated subjects (ages, 7-30) demonstrated stable or improved cognitive test scores following therapy and no irreversible neurotoxicity, despite CAR-T-related antileukemic response, cytokine release syndrome, and trafficking of CAR-T cells to the CSF. The NSC allowed us to document the type and timing of symptoms and explore the etiology of neurotoxicity associated with CD22 CAR-T therapy. Cytokine profiling demonstrated that more concerning symptoms of neurotoxicity, such as hallucination and disorientation, were significantly associated with higher serum cytokine levels, supporting the hypothesis of inflammation-driven neurotoxicity. Systematic assessments of neurotoxicity were feasible in acutely ill children and young adults and served to characterize and monitor the symptoms associated with CAR-T therapy. We recommend these evaluations be incorporated into future immunotherapy protocols.",,"['Shalabi, Haneen', 'Wolters, Pamela L', 'Martin, Staci', 'Toledo-Tamula, Mary Anne', 'Roderick, Marie Claire', 'Struemph, Kari', 'Kane, Eli', 'Yates, Bonnie', 'Delbrook, Cindy', 'Mackall, Crystal L', 'Lee, Daniel W', 'Fry, Terry J', 'Shah, Nirali N']","['Shalabi H', 'Wolters PL', 'Martin S', 'Toledo-Tamula MA', 'Roderick MC', 'Struemph K', 'Kane E', 'Yates B', 'Delbrook C', 'Mackall CL', 'Lee DW', 'Fry TJ', 'Shah NN']",,"['Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Clinical Monitoring Research Program, Leidos Biomedical Research Inc., NCI Campus at Frederick, Frederick, MD.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy Program, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",,United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Brain/*drug effects', 'Child', 'Confusion', 'Cytokines/blood', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*diagnosis', 'Female', 'Hallucinations', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Mental Status and Dementia Tests', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 2/*immunology', 'Spine/*pathology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6086728,,,,2018/07/27 06:00,2019/09/19 06:00,['2018/07/27 06:00'],"['2018/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/19 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CJI.0000000000000241 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2018 Sep;41(7):350-358. doi: 10.1097/CJI.0000000000000241.,7,350-358,"['Z99 CA999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 CA999999/NULL/International']",,,,,['NIHMS977840'],,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: We reanalyzed our previously published cohort, to unravel which colonization timepoints before and during allo-HSCT might be predictive for the subsequent outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report about 268 patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving an allo-HSCT between 2006 and 2016. RESULTS: We identified 129 never-colonized patients, 15 previously colonized patients (positive only before admission for allo-HSCT), 41 persistently colonized patients (positive before and at admission for allo-HSCT), and 83 newly colonized patients (positive only during allo-HSCT). Persistently and newly colonized patients had a worse 60 months OS due to increased incidence of non-relapse-related mortality (NRM) than never-colonized patients (OS: never-colonized: 61.0% vs persistently colonized: 43.5%; P = 0.023 vs newly colonized: 45.6%; P = 0.046). In contrast, OS and NRM of never-colonized and previously colonized patients as well as between persistently and newly colonized patients were similar. CONCLUSION: Patients can lose their VRE colonization status and acquisition of VRE during inpatient stay for allo-HSCT decreases survival to a similar extend as persistent colonization.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This review covers the most challenging aspects and developments of this method, aiming at supporting further its implementation in clinical practices. Area covered: Flow cytometric MRD is based on the discrimination of leukemia cells from their physiological counterparts by the recognition of the leukemia-associated immunophenotypes. Technical and standardization advances along the last decades have been implemented allowing flow cytometric MRD to consolidate its role in modern therapeutic protocols for ALs. However, gaps in sensitivity and data interpretation are still present together with the need for further optimization of MRD-based clinical protocols. In this review, we critically analyze and discuss the most relevant and representative contributions in the field by accurate selection of the literature available in PubMed.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the real-life impact of posaconazole prophylaxis. Materials and Methods: Eighty-four adult patients were included with AML under remission induction chemotherapy and posaconazole prophylaxis. The 34 patients in the control group did not receive primary antifungal prophylaxis. The period between June 2006 and January 2009, when antifungal prophylaxis was not administered (control group), was retrospectively compared to the period between December 2010 and May 2012 when primary oral posaconazole prophylaxis was administered in similar conditions (posaconazole group) according to the use of antifungal agents for treatment, breakthrough infections, galactomannan performance, and the necessity for performing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedures. Results: The two groups were compared according to the use of antifungal agents; progression to a different antifungal agent was found in 34/34 patients (100%) in the control group and in 9/84 patients (11%) in the posaconazole group (p<0.001). There were four breakthrough IFIs (4/84, 4.8%) in the posaconazole group and 34 IFIs in the control group (p<0.001).

Objectives: The aim of this study was to clarify NMDAR contribution to megakaryocytic differentiation in both normal and leukemic cells. Methods: Meg-01, Set-2, and K-562 leukemic cell lines were differentiated using phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, 10 nmol L(-1)) or valproic acid (VPA, 500 mumol L(-1)). Normal megakaryocytes were grown from mouse marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitors (lineage-negative and CD41a-enriched) in the presence of thrombopoietin (30-40 nmol L(-1)). Marrow explants were used to monitor proplatelet formation in the native bone marrow milieu. In all culture systems, NMDARs were inhibited using memantine and MK-801 (100 mumol L(-1)); their effects compared against appropriate controls. Results: The most striking observation from our studies was that NMDAR antagonists markedly inhibited proplatelet formation in all primary cultures employed. Proplatelets were either absent (in the presence of memantine) or short, broad and intertwined (with MK-801). Earlier steps of megakaryocytic differentiation (acquisition of CD41a and nuclear ploidy) were maintained, albeit reduced. In contrast, in leukemic Meg-01 cells, NMDAR antagonists inhibited differentiation in the presence of PMA and VPA but induced differentiation when applied by themselves. Conclusions: NMDAR-mediated calcium influx is required for normal megakaryocytic differentiation, in particular proplatelet formation. However, in leukemic cells, the main NMDAR role is to inhibit differentiation, suggesting diversion of NMDAR activity to support leukemia growth. Further elucidation of the NMDAR and calcium pathways in megakaryocytic cells may suggest novel ways to modulate abnormal megakaryopoiesis.",,"['Kamal, Tania', 'Green, Taryn N', 'Hearn, James I', 'Josefsson, Emma C', 'Morel-Kopp, Marie-Christine', 'Ward, Christopher M', 'During, Matthew J', 'Kalev-Zylinska, Maggie L']","['Kamal T', 'Green TN', 'Hearn JI', 'Josefsson EC', 'Morel-Kopp MC', 'Ward CM', 'During MJ', 'Kalev-Zylinska ML']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3988-2659', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6478-5204', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4795-1746', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8378-8048']","['Department of Molecular Medicine & Pathology University of Auckland Auckland New Zealand.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine & Pathology University of Auckland Auckland New Zealand.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine & Pathology University of Auckland Auckland New Zealand.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research Parkville Vic.

One of the molecular research lines for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer is the use of long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) which are a class of non-coding RNA molecules longer than 200 base pairs in length that act as the key regulator of gene expression. Different aspects of cellular activities like cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration are regulated by lncRNAs. In various cancers, aberrant expression of lncRNAs has been reported. One of the lncRNAs that showed upregulation in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is lncRNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1). Here, we performed blockage of lncRNA PVT1 in human acute erythroleukemia (AEL) cell line (KG1) using antisense LNA GapmeRs. Then, at different time points (24, 48 and 72 hours) after transfection, qRTrealtime PCR and AnnexinV/Propidium Iodide staining assay were performed. The data were processed using the ANOVA test. At all three time points, the ratio of apoptotic cells in the PVT1 antisense LNA GapmeRs treated group was higher than the other groups. The ratio of necrotic cells in the antisense LNA GapmeRs group was also higher than the other groups. These assessments show that inhibition of lncRNA PVT1 could significantly induce apoptosis and necrosis in KG1 cells.

Here, we present the most updated incidence rates of second primary malignancy from original diagnosis of PTC by using the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. In this cohort, 3,200 patients developed SPM, a substantially higher number than in the reference population of 2,749 with observed to expected ratio (O/E) of 1.16 (95% CI; 1.12-1.21). Bone and joint cancer had the highest O/E ratio of 4.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33-7.15) followed by salivary gland (O/E 4.15; 95% CI 2.76-6.0) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (O/E 3.98; 95% CI 2.12-6.8). Mean age at the diagnosis of SPM was 64.4 years old. Interestingly, incidence of colorectal cancer was lower in thyroid cancer survivors compared to general population (large intestine O/E 0.3; 95% CI 0.06-0.88, rectum O/E 0.6; 95% CI 0.41-0.85); however, this was not observed in patients who underwent radiation therapy. The incidence of SPM at all sites was higher during 2000-2012 compared to 1992-1999 (O/E 1.24 versus 1.10). Surprisingly, patients with micropapillary cancer had higher incidence of SPM than counterparts with a larger tumor in radiation group (O/E of 1.40 versus 1.15). O/E of all cancers were higher in males compared to females with O/E of 1.41 versus 1.17 during the period of 2000-2012. Diagnosis of PTC before age 50, especially at age 30-34, was associated with higher incidence of overall SPM (age 30-34; O/E 1.43; 95% CI; 1.19-1.71). Efficient monitoring strategies that include age at the time of thyroid cancer diagnosis, exposure to radiation, gender, and genetic susceptibility may successfully detect SPM earlier in the disease course.

At diagnosis, the FLT3-ITD status is routinely assessed by fragment analysis, providing information about the length but not the position and sequence of the ITD. To overcome this limitation, we performed cDNA-based high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS) in 250 FLT3-ITD positive AML patients, treated on German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG) trials. FLT3-ITD status determined by routine diagnostics was confirmed by HTAS in 242 out of 250 patients (97%). The total number of ITDs detected by HTAS was higher than in routine diagnostics (n = 312 vs. n = 274). In particular, HTAS detected a higher number of ITDs per patient compared to fragment analysis, indicating higher sensitivity for subclonal ITDs. Patients with more than one ITD according to HTAS had a significantly shorter overall and relapse free survival. There was a close correlation between FLT3-ITD mRNA levels in fragment analysis and variant allele frequency in HTAS. However, the abundance of long ITDs (>/=75nt) was underestimated by HTAS, as the size of the ITD affected the mappability of the corresponding sequence reads. In summary, this study demonstrates that HTAS is a feasible approach for FLT3-ITD detection in AML patients, delivering length, position, sequence and mutational burden of this alteration in a single assay with high sensitivity.

Accumulating evidence indicates that TRKA and its ligand, nerve growth factor (NGF), may play a role in normal hematopoiesis and may be deregulated in leukemogenesis. Here, we report a comprehensive evaluation of TRKA signaling in normal and leukemic cells. TRKA expression is highest in common myeloid progenitors and is overexpressed in core binding factor and megakaryocytic leukemias, especially Down syndrome-related AML. Importantly, NGF can rescue GM-CSF dependent TF-1 AML cells, but does not drive proliferation in other TRKA-expressing lines. Although TRKA expression is heterogeneous between and within AML samples, NGF stimulation broadly induces ERK signaling, demonstrating the functional ability of AML cells to respond to NGF/TRKA signaling. However, neither shRNA knockdown nor pharmacologic inhibition have significant anti-proliferative effects on human AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Thus, despite functional NGF/TRKA signaling, the importance of TRKA in AML remains unclear.",,"['Herbrich, Shelley M', 'Kannan, Sankaranarayanan', 'Nolo, Riitta M', 'Hornbaker, Marisa', 'Chandra, Joya', 'Zweidler-McKay, Patrick A']","['Herbrich SM', 'Kannan S', 'Nolo RM', 'Hornbaker M', 'Chandra J', 'Zweidler-McKay PA']",,"['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Immunogen, Inc., Waltham, Massachuessettes, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180710,United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,PMC6059018,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)', 'NGF/TRKA signaling', 'leukemogenesis']",['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no competing interest.'],2018/07/27 06:00,2018/07/27 06:01,['2018/07/27 06:00'],"['2018/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.25723 [doi]', '25723 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2018 Jul 10;9(53):30092-30105. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.25723. eCollection 2018 Jul 10.,53,30092-30105,"['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR000369/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR000371/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that FZKA decoction inhibited proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells through activation of AMP-activated protein kinase alpha (AMPKalpha) signaling pathway, followed by inducing insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) and forkhead homeobox type O3a (FOXO3a) proteins, and enhanced the inhibition effect of gefitinib in lung cancer cell growth via inactivating PI3-K/Akt-mediated suppressing of cell surface-associated mucin-1 (MUC1) expression. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism by which FZKA decoction affected cell apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Our results show that FZKA induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells. Mechanistically, FZKA activated the caspase-3, PARP, and caspase-9 activities. Both antiapoptotic and proapoptotic proteins from Bcl-2 family were deregulated by FZKA exposure in lung cancer cells. In addition, FZKA reduced protein expressions of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and Jun activation domain-binding protein 1 (Jab1), while it concomitantly increased p21 protein. Moreover, the inhibitor of caspase-3 resisted the effect of FZKA on induction of apoptosis. Finally, exogenous overexpression of STAT3 overcame FZKA-inhibited protein expressions of Bcl-2 and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) as well as Bax and blocked FZKA-induced activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9. Our results show that FZKA decoction promotes lung cancer cell apoptosis through STAT3/Bcl-2/caspase-3 signaling pathways.

Clonal heterogeneity has recently been established as a feature in MM, however, the subclonal evolution associated with disease progression has not been described. Here, we performed whole-exome sequencing of serial samples from 10 patients, providing new insights into the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smouldering MM (SMM), to symptomatic MM. We confirm that intraclonal genetic heterogeneity is a common feature at diagnosis and that the driving events involved in disease progression are more subtle than previously reported. We reveal that MM evolution is mainly characterised by the phenomenon of clonal stability, where the transformed subclonal PC populations identified at MM are already present in the asymptomatic MGUS/SMM stages.

We hypothesized that cachexia-associated adipose wasting is driven in part by tumor humoral factors that induce adipocyte lipolysis. We developed an assay to purify secreted factors from a cachexia-inducing colon cancer line that increases lipolysis in adipocytes and identified leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) by mass spectrometry. Recombinant LIF induced lipolysis in vitro. Peripheral LIF administered to mice caused >50% loss of adipose tissue and >10% reduction in body weight despite only transient hypophagia due to decreasing leptin. LIF-injected mice lacking leptin (ob/ob) resulted in persistent hypophagia and loss of adipose tissue and body weight. LIF's peripheral role of initiating lipolysis in adipose loss was confirmed in pair-fed ob/ob mouse studies.

Hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are commonly used, with suboptimal outcomes. Vadastuximab talirine is a CD33-directed antibody conjugated to pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimers. Preclinically, HMAs followed by vadastuximab talirine produced upregulated CD33 expression, increased DNA incorporation by PBD, and enhanced cytotoxicity. A combination cohort in a phase 1 study (NCT01902329) assessed safety, tolerability, and activity of vadastuximab talirine with HMAs. Those eligible had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group status 0 to 1 and previously untreated CD33-positive AML, and declined intensive therapy. Vadastuximab talirine was administered intravenously at 10 mug/kg on last day of HMA (azacitidine or decitabine) infusion in 4-week cycles. Among 53 patients treated, the median age was 75 years. Patients had adverse (38%) or intermediate (62%) cytogenetic risk. Median treatment duration was 19.3 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported. The majority of adverse events were a result of myelosuppression, with some causing therapy delays. Thirty- and 60-day mortality rates were 2% and 8%, respectively. The composite remission rate (complete remission [CR] and CR with incomplete blood count recovery) was 70%. Fifty-one percent of remissions were minimal residual disease-negative by flow cytometry. Similarly high remission rates were observed in patients with secondary AML, aged at least 75 years, and with adverse cytogenetic risk. Median relapse-free survival and overall survival were 7.7 and 11.3 months, respectively.

Imatinib (gleevec, STI-571) is a selective inhibitor of BCR-ABL activity highly effective in the treatment of CML. However, even though almost all CML patients respond to treatment with imatinib or third generation inhibitors, these drugs are not curative and need to be taken indefinitely or until patients become resistant. Therefore, to get a definitive eradication of leukemic cells, it is necessary to find novel therapeutic combinations, for achieving greater efficacy and fewer side effects. Curcumin is an Indian spice with several therapeutic properties: anti-oxidant, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic and anti-cancer. In cancer disease, it acts by blocking cell transformation, proliferation, and invasion and by inducing cell apoptosis. METHODS: In the present study, the effect of a sub-toxic dose of curcumin on K562 cells was evaluated by using the technique of Sequential Window Activation of All Theoretical Mass Spectra (SWATH-MS). Bioinformatic analysis of proteomic data was performed to highlight the pathways mostly affected by the treatment. The involvement of Hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha) was assayed by evaluating its activation status and the modulation of importin 7 (IPO7) and miR-22 was assessed by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis. Finally, K562 cells transfected with miR-22 inhibitor were used to confirm the ability of curcumin to elicit miR-22 expression. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the most relevant effect induced by curcumin was a consistent decrease of several proteins involved in glucose metabolism, most of which were HIF-1alpha targets, concomitant with the up-regulation of functional and structural mitochondrial proteins. The mechanism by which curcumin affects metabolic enzyme profile was associated with the reduction of HIF-1alpha activity, due to the miR-22-mediated down-regulation of IPO7 expression. Finally, the ability of curcumin to enhance in vitro the efficiency of imatinib was reported. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our data indicates that the miR-22/IPO7/HIF-1alpha axis may be considered as a novel molecular target of curcumin adding new insights to better define therapeutic activity and anticancer properties of this natural compound.

Although generally well tolerated, here we describe our institutional experience of unique adverse effects encountered with the use of ibrutinib in patients with B-cell lymphomas. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study done at a tertiary care facility, to evaluate adverse events in patients with B-cell malignancies on treatment with ibrutinib between 2014 and 2018. Further details including type of malignancy, cytogenetics, interventions for treatment of the side effect, and outcomes were obtained through electronic health record. CASE SERIES: We found 10 patients with unique adverse events related to ibrutinib. Among those, six had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, two had Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and two had mantle cell lymphoma. The events included palindromic rheumatoid arthritis, diffuse spongiotic dermatitis, bullous pemphigoid, recurrent hemorrhagic stroke, peripheral neuropathy, recurrent paronychia, intramedullary fibrosis, recurrent joint pains, pulmonary aspergillosis, dyspnea with exacerbation of atrial fibrillation, and resolution of autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSION: Our case series illustrates the wide variety of unique events recognized in patients treated with ibrutinib, some of which required cessation and most had dose reduction of the treatment. Thus, stressing the importance of early identification and intervention for the events to avoid worsening of toxicity and inability to continue treatment in such patients.",,"['Shaikh, Hira', 'Khattab, Ahmed', 'Faisal, Muhammad S', 'Chilkulwar, Abhishek', 'Albrethsen, Mary', 'Sadashiv, Santhosh', 'Fazal, Salman']","['Shaikh H', 'Khattab A', 'Faisal MS', 'Chilkulwar A', 'Albrethsen M', 'Sadashiv S', 'Fazal S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5604-4166'],"['1 Department of Internal Medicine, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.', '1 Department of Internal Medicine, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.', '2 Hematology-Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, USA.', '3 Division of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.', '3 Division of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.', '3 Division of Hematology and Cellular Therapy, Allegheny Health Network, Pittsburgh, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180725,England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/drug therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects', 'Pyrazoles/*adverse effects', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/drug therapy']",,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell malignancies', 'Ibrutinib', 'adverse event', 'hematological malignancies', 'unique']",,2018/07/27 06:00,2019/07/10 06:00,['2018/07/27 06:00'],"['2018/07/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155218788707 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2019 Jul;25(5):1265-1270. doi: 10.1177/1078155218788707.

We describe a case of PML, which developed after prolonged ibrutinib use and a low burden of chronic lymphocytic leukemia disease. The delay in diagnosis of the patient despite multiple presentations to medical providers across different facilities suggests that there is a lack of awareness of PML as a potential complication of ibrutinib. Treatments with postulated anti-John Cunningham polyomavirus agents and IL-2 were ineffective, likely due to the advanced state of the patient's disease. Although recent evidence indicates that ibrutinib may enhance cell-mediated immunity, consistent with elevated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and appropriate T-cell response to mitogens in the patient, ibrutinib-mediated inhibition of the humoral function may contribute to PML pathogenesis. As the duration of ibrutinib use is often indefinite, and the number of indications for ibrutinib continues to grow, recognition and further evaluation of the link between PML and ibrutinib is warranted.","['(c) 2018 S.

Myricetin, an abundant flavonoid found in the bark and leaves of bayberry, shows multiple promising anti-tumor functions in various cancers. METHODS: The cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects of myricetin on prostate cancer cells were investigated in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Short-hairpin RNA knockdown of the proviral integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus-1 (PIM1), pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays, and an intracellular Ca2+ flux assay were used to investigate the potential underlying mechanism of myricetin. ONCOMINE database data mining and immunohistochemical analysis of prostate cancer tissues were used to evaluate the expression of PIM1 and CXCR4, as well as the correlation between PIM1 and CXCR4 expression and the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognoses of prostate cancer patients. RESULTS: Myricetin exerted selective cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic, and anti-metastatic effects on prostate cancer cells by inhibiting PIM1 and disrupting the PIM1/CXCR4 interaction. Moreover, PIM1 and CXCR4 were coexpressed and associated with aggressive clinicopathologic traits and poor prognosis in prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION: These results offer preclinical evidence for myricetin as a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for precision medicine tailored to prostate cancer patients characterized by concomitant elevated expression of PIM1 and CXCR4.","['(c) 2018 The Author(s).

Studies using leukemia cell lines suggest that DENV specific antibodies can enhance Zika virus (ZIKV) infectivity, and vice versa. To examine the mechanisms of ADE of ZIKV infection in primary human cells, we assessed 40 serum samples obtained from convalescent DENV-1 or DENV-3 infected subjects. All sera tested exhibited high binding potency, while modest or none neutralization activities against ZIKV. Primary CD14+ monocytes, rather than B and T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were found to be the mediators of the enhancement of ZIKV infectivity by DENV immune sera. Monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells (DCs), but not mature DCs were highly permissive to ZIKV infection, whereas neither immature nor mature DCs could mediate enhanced ZIKV infection in the presence of DENV immune sera. In addition, antibody blocking of either FcgammaRI (CD64), or FcgammaRII (CD32), or FcgammaRIII (CD16) resulted in diminished ADE of ZIKV infection.

The Malaysia-Singapore ALL 2010 study (MS2010) prospectively upgraded the risk assignment of patients with IKZF1(del) to the next highest level and added imatinib to the treatment of all patients with BCR- ABL1 fusion. Patients and Methods In total, 823 patients with B-ALL treated in the Malyasia-Singapore ALL 2003 study (MS2003; n = 507) and MS2010 (n = 316) were screened for IKZF1(del) using the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification assay. The impact of IKZF1(del) on the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was compared between the two studies. Results Patient characteristics were similar in both cohorts, including IKZF1(del) frequencies (59 of 410 [14.4%] v 50 of 275 [18.2%]; P = .2). In MS2003, where IKZF1(del) was not used in risk assignment, IKZF1(del) conferred a significantly higher 5-year CIR (30.4% v 8.1%; P = 8.7 x 10(-7)), particularly in the intermediate-risk group who lacked high-risk features (25.0% v 7.5%; P = .01). For patients with BCR-ABL1-negative disease, IKZF1(del) conferred a higher 5-year CIR (20.5% v 8.0%; P = .01). In MS2010, the 5-year CIR of patients with IKZF1(del) significantly decreased to 13.5% ( P = .05) and no longer showed a significant difference in patients with BCR-ABL1-negative disease (11.4% v 4.4%; P = .09). The 5-year overall survival for patients with IKZF1(del) improved from 69.6% in MS2003 to 91.6% in MS2010 ( P = .007). Conclusion Intensifying therapy for childhood B-ALL with IKZF1(del) significantly reduced the risk of relapse and improved overall survival.

Although recent studies have shown that BLV strains can be classified into 10 distinct genotypes, no information is available regarding the BLV genotype prevalent in cattle in India. To determine the genetic variability in BLV, in this study, 118 adult dairy cows from three states of India were screened for BLV infection by env gp51-specific ELISA and nested PCR. Of the 33 cows found positive by both PCR and ELISA, 10 selected BLV strains were subjected to molecular characterization. Phylogenetic analyses of partial and full-length env gp51 gene sequences of Indian BLV strains and other geographical diverse BLV strains representing all the 10 genotypes revealed that Indian strains belonged to BLV genotype 6. Although Indian strains showed close genetic proximity with the strains circulating in South America, they were classified into a new subgenotype within genotype 6. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences in gp51 demonstrated substitutions mainly in conformational epitope G, neutralizing domain 2 and linear epitope D, with a novel mutation (threonine to alanine at residue 252) found in D-epitope of all the Indian BLV strains. Although serological evidence of BLV infection in India has been reported earlier, this study on molecular characterization of BLV strains established the existence of BLV genotype 6 in India. Additionally, the results of this study highlight the importance of genetic analysis of geographically diverse BLV strains to understand BLV global genetic diversity and further studies are required to determine BLV genetic diversity and extent of BLV infection in cattle in India.",['(c) 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.'],"['Gautam, Siddharth', 'Mishra, Niranjan', 'Kalaiyarasu, Semmannan', 'Jhade, Sandeep Kumar', 'Sood, Richa']","['Gautam S', 'Mishra N', 'Kalaiyarasu S', 'Jhade SK', 'Sood R']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7231-0583'],"['Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, India.', 'Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, India.', 'Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, India.', 'Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, India.', 'Indian Council of Agricultural Research-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases, Bhopal, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180809,Germany,Transbound Emerg Dis,Transboundary and emerging diseases,101319538,,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cattle', '*Genotype', 'India', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Phylogeny']",,['NOTNLM'],"['India', 'bovine leukaemia virus', 'envelope glycoprotein (gp51) gene', 'genotype 6', 'molecular characterization', 'phylogenetic analysis']",,2018/07/26 06:00,2019/01/27 06:00,['2018/07/26 06:00'],"['2018/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/01/27 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/tbed.12979 [doi]'],ppublish,Transbound Emerg Dis. 2018 Dec;65(6):1968-1978. doi: 10.1111/tbed.12979.

Adult cancer survivors may also have a lower balance function than healthy adults. We examined muscle strength and balance function among 19 cancer survivors and 14 healthy subjects. The mean age of the cancer survivors was 51.5 +/- 11.2 years; 6 men and 13 women. Cancer diagnoses included breast cancer, retroperitoneal sarcoma, acute leukemia, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, thyroid cancer, Ewing's sarcoma, and tongue cancer. The mean age of healthy subjects was 47.4 +/- 14 years; 3 men, 11 women. Muscle strength was assessed using hand grip and knee extensor strength tests. Balance function was evaluated using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, and body sway was tested using a force platform. No significant differences were found with respect to right and left grip strength or right and left knee extension strength between the 2 groups. A significantly higher TUG time was observed in cancer survivors than in healthy subjects ( P < .05). With eyes open, the area of the center of pressure was significantly larger in cancer survivors than in healthy subjects ( P < .05). Similarly, the length per area was significantly lower both with eyes open and closed for cancer survivors than for healthy subjects ( P < .05). TUG was significantly correlated with muscle strength in both groups ( P < .05). However, no body sway parameters were related to muscle strength in either group. Cancer survivors had lower balance function that might not have been related to muscle strength. Cancer survivors should be evaluated for balance function as there is a potential for impairment.

Complications after HSCT include relapse, graft versus host disease (GvHD), graft rejection and infection. Over the last few years several groups, have demonstrated that non-HLA gene polymorphisms can be predictive of outcome after HSCT. Since the glucocorticoid cortisol is pivotal in the regulation of the immune system, we decided to examine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs6198, rs33388 and rs33389) within the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and correlate with HSCT outcome. The training set consisted of patients (n = 458) who underwent HSCT for acute leukaemia between 1983 and 2005. In the recipients, the absence of the ACT haplotype and absence of the T allele of rs33388 were associated with decreased OS and the absence of the ACT haplotype, the absence of the T allele of rs33388 and the presence of the ATA haplotype were associated with increased risk of relapse. In addition, the presence of the ACT haplotype in the recipient showed a trend to be associated with increased risk of chronic graft versus host disease (cGvHD). The patients in this cohort received mainly myeloablative conditioning (n = 327). The SNPs in the glucocorticoid receptor were then investigated in a validation set (n = 251) of HSCT patients transplanted for acute leukaemia from 2006. This cohort contained significantly more patients that had received reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). Some of the results could be validated in these patients.

Due to their ability to promote self-renewal, Id proteins have been considered as oncogenes, and potential therapeutic targets in cancer models. On the contrary, certain Id proteins are reported to act as tumor suppressors in the development of Burkitt's lymphoma in humans, and hepatosplenic and innate-like T cell lymphomas in mice. The contexts and mechanisms by which Id proteins can serve in such contradictory roles to determine tumor outcomes are still not well understood. In this review, we explore the roles of Id proteins in lymphocyte development and tumorigenesis, particularly with respect to inhibition of their canonical DNA binding partners known as E proteins. Transcriptional regulation by E proteins, and their antagonism by Id proteins, act as gatekeepers to ensure appropriate lymphocyte development at key checkpoints. We re-examine the derailment of these regulatory mechanisms in lymphocytes that facilitate tumor development.

Thanks to the efficacy of TKIs, CML has switched from a fatal to a 'chronic' pathology, and data from clinical trials have become insufficient to drive physicians' prescription choices and address long-term treatment outcomes. On the brink of commercialization of generic imatinib, this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic pattern of CP-CML and the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) over a decade of local real clinical practice. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed on CP-CML patients followed up in the Local Health Unit of Treviso (Veneto Region, Italy) during the period 2005-2015. Data were captured from both administrative databases and physicians' patient diaries. RESULTS: Of 81 CP-CML patients, 73 were treated with first-line imatinib; among the second-generation TKIs, only nilotinib was used (n = 8). Overall, 38% of imatinib-treated subjects needed to switch, mainly due to intolerance, whereas no switches occurred in the nilotinib cohort. Osteoarticular pain was the most common AE and was significantly more frequent in the imatinib cohort (68.49 vs. 25.00%, p = 0.022). Other common AEs were dermatologic manifestations, asthenia, and diarrhea. CONCLUSION: Although based on a small population, this study represents an unbiased reference on the long-term management of CML in an Italian clinical setting. Our results indicate a better profile of first-line nilotinib, both in terms of persistency and tolerability. AEs remain a major concern, highlighting the importance of close monitoring.",,"['Bettiol, Alessandra', 'Marconi, Ettore', 'Lombardi, Niccolo', 'Crescioli, Giada', 'Gherlinzoni, Filippo', 'Walley, Thomas', 'Vannacci, Alfredo', 'Chinellato, Alessandro', 'Giusti, Pietro']","['Bettiol A', 'Marconi E', 'Lombardi N', 'Crescioli G', 'Gherlinzoni F', 'Walley T', 'Vannacci A', 'Chinellato A', 'Giusti P']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy. alessandra.bettiol@unifi.it.', ""Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drug Research and Children's Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. alessandra.bettiol@unifi.it."", ""Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drug Research and Children's Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."", ""Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drug Research and Children's Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."", ""Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drug Research and Children's Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."", 'Department of Hematology, Local Health Unit n.2 Marca Trevigiana, Treviso, Italy.', 'Institute of Psychology Health and Society, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK.', ""Department of Neurosciences, Psychology, Drug Research and Children's Health, University of Florence, Florence, Italy."", 'Pharmaceutical Service, Local Health Unit n.3 Serenissima, Venice, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical and Pharmacological Sciences, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Pragmatic Clinical Trial']",,New Zealand,Clin Drug Investig,Clinical drug investigation,9504817,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cohort Studies', 'Exanthema/chemically induced', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pain/chemically induced', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",,,,,2018/07/26 06:00,2018/12/12 06:00,['2018/07/26 06:00'],"['2018/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/12/12 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40261-018-0676-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s40261-018-0676-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Drug Investig. 2018 Sep;38(9):837-844. doi: 10.1007/s40261-018-0676-7.,9,837-844,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The amount of these released mediators has been measured biochemically using cell mass. To investigate degranulation in living single cells, fluorescence microscopy has traditionally been used to observe the disappearance of granules and the appearance of these discharged granules within the plasma membrane by membrane fusion and the movement of granules inside the cells. Here, we developed a method of video-rate bioluminescence imaging to directly detect degranulation from a single mast cell by measuring luminescence activity derived from the enzymatic reaction between Gaussia luciferase (GLase) and its substrate coelenterazine. The neuropeptide Y (NPY), which was reported to colocalize with serotonin in the secretory granules, fused to GLase (NPY-GLase) was efficiently expressed in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells, a mast-cell line, using a preferred human codon-optimized gene. Bioluminescence imaging analysis of RBL-2H3 cells expressing NPY-GLase and adhered on a glass-bottomed dish showed that the luminescence signals from the resting cells were negligible, while the luminescence signals of the secreted NPY-GLase were repeatedly detected after the addition of an antigen. In addition, this imaging method was applicable for observing degranulation in RBL-2H3 cells that adhered to the extracellular matrix (ECM). These results indicated that video-rate bioluminescence imaging using GLase will be a useful tool for detecting degranulation in single mast cells adhered to a variety of ECM proteins.",,"['Yokawa, Satoru', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Hayashi, Ayumi', 'Inouye, Satoshi', 'Inoh, Yoshikazu', 'Furuno, Tadahide']","['Yokawa S', 'Suzuki T', 'Hayashi A', 'Inouye S', 'Inoh Y', 'Furuno T']",,"['School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Dentistry, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Yokohama Research Center, JNC Corporation, Yokohama, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180710,Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,PMC6048188,['NOTNLM'],"['bioluminescence', 'degranulation', 'extracellular matrix', 'imaging', 'mast cell']",,2018/07/26 06:00,2018/07/26 06:01,['2018/07/26 06:00'],"['2018/03/22 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2018.00074 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2018 Jul 10;6:74. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2018.00074. eCollection 2018.,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, due to the vast heterogeneity of the malignancy, no conclusive target(s) have been deciphered. However, the role of miRNA in SMZL, much as it has in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, may serve as a guiding light.

However, this enhanced efficacy was linked with elevated rates of high-grade adverse events. The aim of this study was to assess the tolerability and toxicity profile of obinutuzumab treatment in routine patients with CLL and FL, of whom the majority had experienced toxicity or resistance to rituximab. Methods: This retrospective cohort study investigated fifteen obinutuzumab-treated patients, eight with CLL and seven with FL. The course of the disease, comorbidities and treatment-related toxicities were recorded. All patients with CLL and all but three FL patients had any form of pre-treatment with rituximab. Results: Between October 2014 and August 2017, 15 patients were treated with obinutuzumab at the University Hospital Krems. In the CLL-cohort, 1 patient (12,5%) developed pneumonia, 2 (25%) febrile neutropenia, 6 (75%) anemia and 7 (87,5%) thrombocytopenia, respectively. One patient exhibited an infusion-related allergic reaction. In the FL-cohort, 6 patients (85,7%) presented with thrombocytopenia, 3 (42,9%) with anemia and one patient with neutropenia.

Cell-to-cell interactions through the virological synapse, biofilm-like structures and cellular conduits have been reported, but the relative contribution of each mechanism on HTLV-1 transmission still remains vastly unknown. The HTLV-1 protein p8 has been found to increase viral transmission and cellular conduits. Here we show that HTLV-1 expressing cells are interconnected by tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) defined as thin structures containing F-actin and lack of tubulin connecting two cells. TNTs connected HTLV-1 expressing cells and uninfected T-cells and monocytes and the viral proteins Tax and Gag localized to these TNTs. The HTLV-1 expressing protein p8 was found to induce TNT formation. Treatment of MT-2 cells with the nucleoside analog cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside, AraC) reduced number of TNTs and furthermore reduced TNT formation induced by the p8 protein. Intercellular transmission of HTLV-1 through TNTs provides a means of escape from recognition by the immune system.

Here, we evaluated two different RRVs derived from amphotropic murine leukemia virus (AMLV) and gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV), which utilize different cellular receptors (PiT-2 and PiT-1, respectively) for viral entry, in human osteosarcoma cells. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that low levels of expression of both receptors were observed in normal and non-malignant cells. However, high PiT-2 (for AMLV) and low PiT-1 (for GALV) expression was observed in most osteosarcoma cell lines. Accordingly, AMLV expressing the green fluorescent protein gene infected and replicated more efficiently than GALV in most osteosarcoma cell lines. Furthermore, RRVs expressing the cytosine deaminase prodrug activator gene showed differential cytotoxicity that correlated with the results of viral spread. AMLV-RRV-mediated prodrug activator gene therapy achieved significant inhibition of subcutaneous MG-63 tumor growth over GALV in nude mice. These data indicate that AMLV vectors predominate over GALV in human osteosarcoma cells.

However, many patients still fail to respond to these therapies. Among the underlying factors, an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a major role. Here we show that monocyte-mediated gene delivery of IFNalpha inhibits leukemia in a mouse model. IFN gene therapy counteracts leukemia-induced expansion of immunosuppressive myeloid cells and imposes an immunostimulatory program to the TME, as shown by bulk and single-cell transcriptome analyses. This reprogramming promotes T-cell priming and effector function against multiple surrogate tumor-specific antigens, inhibiting leukemia growth in our experimental model. Durable responses are observed in a fraction of mice and are further increased combining gene therapy with checkpoint blockers. Furthermore, IFN gene therapy strongly enhances anti-tumor activity of adoptively transferred T cells engineered with tumor-specific TCR or CAR, overcoming suppressive signals in the leukemia TME.

Virtually all PV patients are iron deficient at presentation and/or during the course of their disease. The co-existence of iron deficiency and polycythemia presents a physiological disconnect. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, is regulated by circulating iron levels, erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone, and inflammation. Both decreased circulating iron and increased erythroferrone levels, which occur as a consequence of erythroid hyperplasia in PV, are anticipated to suppress hepcidin and enable recovery from iron deficiency. Inflammation which accompanies PV is likely to counteract hepcidin suppression, but the relatively low serum ferritin levels observed suggest that inflammation is not a major contributor to the dysregulated iron metabolism. Furthermore, potential defects in iron absorption, aberrant hypoxia sensing and signaling, and frequency of bleeding to account for iron deficiency in PV patients have not been fully elucidated. Insufficiently suppressed hepcidin given the degree of iron deficiency in PV patients strongly suggests that disordered iron metabolism is an important component of the pathobiology of PV. Normalization of hematocrit levels using therapeutic phlebotomy is the most common approach for reducing the incidence of thrombotic complications, a therapy which exacerbates iron deficiency, contributing to a variety of non-hematological symptoms. The use of cytoreductive therapy in high-risk PV patients frequently works more effectively to reverse PV-associated symptoms in iron-deficient relative to iron-replete patients. Lastly, differences in iron-related parameters between PV patients and mice with JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations suggest that specific regions in JAK2 may influence iron metabolism by nuanced changes of erythropoietin receptor signaling. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical consequences of iron deficiency in PV, provide a framework for understanding the potential dysregulation of iron metabolism, and present a rationale for additional therapeutic options for iron-deficient PV patients.",,"['Ginzburg, Yelena Z', 'Feola, Maria', 'Zimran, Eran', 'Varkonyi, Judit', 'Ganz, Tomas', 'Hoffman, Ronald']","['Ginzburg YZ', 'Feola M', 'Zimran E', 'Varkonyi J', 'Ganz T', 'Hoffman R']",,"['Division of Hematology Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA. yelena.ginzburg@mssm.edu.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology Oncology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",20180724,England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['E1UOL152H7 (Iron)'],IM,"['Anemia, Iron-Deficiency/*etiology/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/metabolism', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Thrombosis/metabolism']",PMC6170398,,,,2018/07/26 06:00,2019/06/14 06:00,['2018/07/26 06:00'],"['2018/05/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/06/14 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-018-0207-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-018-0207-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2018 Oct;32(10):2105-2116. doi: 10.1038/s41375-018-0207-9.

This mutational complexity has spurred the development of pan-target inhibitors, i.e., therapies for which no single target mutation can cause resistance. Because the propensity for on- versus off-target resistance varies across cancer types, a deeper understanding of the mutational burden in drug targets could rationalize treatment outcomes and prioritize pan-target inhibitors for indications where on-target mutations are most likely.Experimental Design: To measure and model the mutational landscape of a drug target at high resolution, we integrated single-molecule Duplex Sequencing of the ABL1 gene in Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) leukemias with computational simulations.Results: A combination of drug target mutational burden and tumor-initiating cell fraction is sufficient to predict that most patients with chronic myeloid leukemia are unlikely to harbor ABL1 resistance mutations at the time of diagnosis, rationalizing the exceptional success of targeted therapy in this setting. In contrast, our analysis predicts that many patients with Ph(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+) ALL) harbor multiple preexisting resistant cells with single mutants. The emergence of compound mutations can be traced to initial use of an ABL1 inhibitor that is susceptible to resistance from single point mutations.Conclusions: These results argue that early use of therapies that achieve pan-inhibition of ABL1 resistance mutants might improve outcomes in Ph(+) ALL. Our findings show how a deep understanding of the mutational burden in drug targets can be quantitatively coupled to phenotypic heterogeneity to rationalize clinical phenomena.

Nonpermissive T-cell epitope (TCE) group mismatches were defined by alloreactive T-cell cross-reactivity for 52/80 HLA-DPB1 alleles (TCE-X). More recently, a numerical functional distance (FD) scoring system for in silico prediction of TCE groups based on the median impact of exon 2-encoded amino acid polymorphism on T-cell alloreactivity was developed for all DPB1 alleles (TCE-FD), including the 28/80 common alleles not assigned by TCE-X. We compared clinical outcome associations of nonpermissive DPB1 mismatches defined by TCE-X or TCE-FD in 8/8 HLA-matched UD-HCT for acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelogenous leukemia between 1999 and 2011 (N = 2730). Concordance between the 2 models was 92.3%, with most differences arising from DPB1*06:01 and DPB1*19:01 being differently assigned by TCE-X and TCE-FD. In both models, nonpermissive mismatches were associated with reduced overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15, P < .006 and HR, 1.12, P < .03), increased transplant-related mortality (HR, 1.31, P < .001 and HR, 1.26, P < .001) as well as acute (HR, 1.16, P < .02 and HR, 1.22, P < .001) and chronic (HR, 1.20, P < .003 and HR, 1.22, P < .001) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We show that in silico prediction of nonpermissive DPB1 mismatches significantly associated with major transplant outcomes is feasible for any DPB1 allele with known exon 2 sequence based on experimentally elaborated FD scores.

CONCLUSION: There is a lack of data to guide use of induction chemotherapy in patients with acute hematologic malignancies requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, particularly with regard to dosing, safety, and efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.

Initially, K562 cell culture experiments were performed using various bolus doses of resveratrol in combination with siRNA for 3days using a factorial design of experiments approach. Resveratrol content was analyzed using HPLC and cell viability was assessed using Annexin V (Non-viable), and Propidium Iodide (PI) (Necrotic) based flow cytometry. Coaxial electrospun fibers with resveratrol were made using 1:1 PCL-GT blends in different configurations: single fibers and coaxial fibers with same polymer blends, or with PCL inner core. Loading efficiency and release profile over five days were analyzed. Based on release profile, K562 cell viability with fibers was analyzed over eight days. Dose dependent cell death was observed with bolus resveratrol and siRNA in the culture. However, resveratrol content depleted significantly when added directly to solution. The combination therapy was additive in solution. SEM analysis showed no phase separation of components and resveratrol loading efficiency varied from 77% to 88% in different configurations; 95% of resveratrol was released by day five. Permeability of resveratrol showed no significant dependency on fiber configuration. After 8days, non-viable cell percentages with controlled release were similar to that at three-day bolus dose of resveratrol. However, siRNA interacted with the fibers, resulting in reduced effect on cells. Loading resveratrol into electrospun fibers provides a localized delivery at therapeutic level, and increased resveratrol's apoptotic effect.

Here, we study the performance and robustness of OBF for biomarker discovery. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we examine how OBF performs on data that violates modeling assumptions, and (2) we provide guidelines on how to set input parameters for robust performance. Contribution (1) addresses an important, relevant, and commonplace problem in computational biology, where it is often impossible to validate an algorithm's core assumptions. To accomplish both tasks, we present a battery of simulations that implement OBF with different inputs and challenge each assumption made by OBF. In particular, we examine the robustness of OBF with respect to incorrect input parameters, false independence, imbalanced sample size, and we address the Gaussianity assumption by considering performance on an extensive family of non-Gaussian distributions. We address advantages and disadvantages between different priors and optimization criteria throughout. Finally, we evaluate the utility of OBF in biomarker discovery using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and colon cancer microarray datasets, and show that OBF is successful at identifying well-known biomarkers for these diseases that rank low under moderated t-test.",,"['Foroughi Pour, Ali', 'Dalton, Lori A']","['Foroughi Pour A', 'Dalton LA']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",20180723,United States,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics,101196755,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Algorithms', '*Bayes Theorem', '*Biomarkers', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Databases, Factual', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/metabolism']",,,,,2018/07/25 06:00,2021/01/05 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/01/05 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1109/TCBB.2018.2858814 [doi]'],ppublish,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform. 2020 Jan-Feb;17(1):250-263. doi: 10.1109/TCBB.2018.2858814.

However, little is known about the function of ANXA8 in porcine endometrial cells so far. Here, ANXA8 mRNA was found to be abundant in porcine endometrium on days 11-13 of pregnancy. Real-time RT-PCR analysis indicated that the mRNA expression of the leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) was upregulated by ANXA8 in porcine endometrial cells. Immunofluorescence technology and cell cycle analysis revealed that ANXA8 promoted the proliferation of endometrial cells, as evidenced by the abundant proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression and an increase in the S phase. Western blot analysis results indicated that ANXA8 activated the phosphorylation of the target protein kinase B (Akt) protein. Immunofluorescence technology results showed that the PCNA protein had no significant change in porcine endometrial cells with both ANXA8 overexpression and the addition of Akt inhibitor. Furthermore, the number of implantation sites was significantly reduced by injection of mus-siRNA-ANXA8 into the uterine horn of mice.

Using national data for Australia, we describe (i) the number and type of treatment centers caring for AYAs, (ii) induction/first-line treatments, and (iii) survival outcomes. PROCEDURE: National population-based study assessing treatment of 15- to 24-year-olds diagnosed with ALL or AML between 2007 and 2012. Treatment details were abstracted from hospital medical records. Treatment centers were classified as pediatric or adult (adult AYA-focused or other adult; and by AYA volume [high/low]). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses examined associations between treatment and overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival outcomes. RESULTS: Forty-seven hospitals delivered induction therapy to 351 patients (181 ALL and 170 AML), with 74 (21%) treated at pediatric centers; 70% of hospitals treated less than two AYA leukemia patients per year. Regardless of treatment center, 82% of ALL patients were on pediatric protocols. For AML, pediatric protocols were not used in adult centers, with adult centers using a non-COG 7+3-type induction protocol (51%, where COG is Cooperative Oncology Group) or an ICE-type protocol (39%, where ICE is idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide). Exploratory analyses suggested that for both ALL and AML, AYAs selected for adult protocols have worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric protocols were commonly used for ALL patients regardless of where they are treated, indicating rapid assimilation of recent evidence by Australian hematologists. For AML, pediatric protocols were only used at pediatric centers. Further investigation is warranted to determine the optimal treatment approach for AYA AML patients.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['White, V M', 'Skaczkowski, G', 'Pinkerton, R', 'Coory, M', 'Osborn, M', 'Bibby, H', 'Nicholls, W', 'Orme, L M', 'Conyers, R', 'Phillips, M B', 'Harrup, R', 'Walker, R', 'Thompson, K', 'Anazodo, A']","['White VM', 'Skaczkowski G', 'Pinkerton R', 'Coory M', 'Osborn M', 'Bibby H', 'Nicholls W', 'Orme LM', 'Conyers R', 'Phillips MB', 'Harrup R', 'Walker R', 'Thompson K', 'Anazodo A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6619-8484', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0715-3563', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2344-1365']","['Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Psychology, Deakin University, Burwood, Victoria, Australia.', 'Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'School of Psychology and Public Health, La Trobe University, Bundoora, Victoria, Australia.', 'Olivia Newton-John Cancer Wellness & Research Centre, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Royal Adelaide Hospital, South Australia, Adelaide, Australia.', 'Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer, Cancer Council Victoria, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Centre, The Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Western Australia, Australia.', 'Royal Hobart Hospital, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia.', ""Children's Health Queensland Hospital and Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia."", 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', ""Kids Cancer Centre, Sydney Children's Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Nelune Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Prince of Wales Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.', ""School of Women's and Children's Health, University of New South Wales, Randwick, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180724,United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Australia', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Medical Oncology/methods', 'Pediatrics/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*adolescents and young adults', '*population-based study', '*survival', '*treatment']",,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/05/21 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27349 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2018 Nov;65(11):e27349. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27349.

Apart from symptoms due to the cancer disease, families continuously experience burden of treatment. Since coping capacities are unique to each individual, we captured variables that offer objective measures of treatment burden, with a particular focus on the disruptive effects of treatment on families' lives. Our sample was comprised by 193 children that died of cancer. Medical records were extracted retrospectively. Quantitative data were statistically analysed with respect to variables related to treatment burden. Deceased children with cancer and their families faced a significant burden of treatment. Results revealed that deceased leukaemia patients had a higher number of inpatient stays, spent more time in the hospital both during their illness and during the last month of their life, and were more likely to die in the hospital when compared to deceased patients with CNS neoplasms and with other diagnoses. Our findings highlight the disruptive effects of treatment that are likely to have a great impact on families' daily life, that go beyond exclusively focusing on side effects, and that needs to be taken into account by the treating staff.",['(c) 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.'],"['Rost, Michael', 'Wangmo, Tenzin', 'Rakic, Milenko', 'Acheson, Elaine', 'Rischewski, Johannes', 'Hengartner, Heinz', 'Kuhne, Thomas', 'Elger, Bernice S']","['Rost M', 'Wangmo T', 'Rakic M', 'Acheson E', 'Rischewski J', 'Hengartner H', 'Kuhne T', 'Elger BS']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6537-9793'],"['Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Children's Hospital, Lucerne, Switzerland."", 'Ostschweizer Kinderspital, St. Gallen, Switzerland.', ""Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, University of Basel Children's Hospital UKBB, Basel, Switzerland."", 'Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180724,England,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl),European journal of cancer care,9301979,,,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Death', '*Family', 'Female', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Medical Records', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Switzerland', 'Terminal Care']",,['NOTNLM'],"['burden of treatment', 'inpatient stays', 'leukaemia', 'paediatric oncology', 'place of death']",,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/03/28 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2017/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/03/30 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/28 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ecc.12879 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Cancer Care (Engl). 2018 Nov;27(6):e12879. doi: 10.1111/ecc.12879.

In this open-label phase 1 study (NCT02181660), Japanese patients (aged >/=18 years) with R/R AML received once-daily gilteritinib, escalating from 20 to 300 mg/d. Primary endpoints were safety/tolerability, including the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose (RD); secondary endpoints were antileukemic activity and pharmacokinetics (PK). Twenty-four Japanese patients with R/R AML received once-daily oral gilteritinib in 1 of 6 dose-escalation cohorts (20, 40, 80, 120, 200, and 300 mg/d). Gilteritinib was well tolerated. The MTD was 200 mg/d; dose-limiting toxicities were grade 3 tumor lysis syndrome (120 mg/d; n = 1); and grade 3 elevated blood lactate dehydrogenase, amylase, blood creatine phosphokinase levels, and syncope (all n = 2; 300 mg/d). The RD was 120 mg/d. The most common drug-related grade >/=3 adverse events were thrombocytopenia (n = 4 [16.7%]) and increased blood creatine phosphokinase (n = 3 [12.5%]). Gilteritinib had a dose-proportional PK profile. Among patients with mutated fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, the overall response rate (ORR) was 80% (n = 4 of 5; complete remission [CR] with incomplete platelet recovery, 1 [20%]; CR with incomplete hematologic recovery, 2 [40%]; partial remission (PR), 1 [20%]). Among patients with wild-type fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, ORR was 36.4%; (n = 4 of 11; CR, 1 [9.1%]; CR with incomplete platelet recovery, 2 [18.2%]; PR, 1 [9.1%]).

DIAGNOSIS: Diagnosis and disease classification are based on histologic review and immunohistochemical staining of an appropriate skin biopsy. Pathologic review and an appropriate staging evaluation are necessary to distinguish primary cutaneous B-cell lymphomas from systemic B-cell lymphomas with secondary skin involvement. RISK STRATIFICATION: Disease histology remains the most important prognostic determinant. Both PCFCL and PCMZL are indolent lymphomas that infrequently disseminate to extracutaneous sites and are associated with 5-year survival rates that exceed 95%. In contrast, PCDLBCL, LT is an aggressive lymphoma with an inferior prognosis. RISK-ADAPTED THERAPY: PCFCL and PCMZL patients with solitary or relatively few skin lesions may be affectively managed with local radiation therapy. While single-agent rituximab may be employed for patients with more widespread skin involvement, multiagent chemotherapy is rarely appropriate. In contrast, management of patients with PCDLBCL, LT is comparable to the management of patients with systemic DLBCL.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Wilcox, Ryan A']",['Wilcox RA'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-6420-0760'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan, Rogel Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],,"['Disease Management', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/classification/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/classification/diagnosis/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rituximab/therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/classification/*diagnosis/therapy']",,,,,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/08/20 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25224 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2018 Nov;93(11):1427-1430. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25224.,11,1427-1430,"['Leukemia and Lymphoma Society/International', 'K08CA172215/NH/NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy is a promising alternative treatment strategy. A novel allogeneic DC vaccine, DCP-001, was developed from an AML-derived cell line that uniquely combines the positive features of allogeneic DC vaccines and expression of multi-leukemia-associated antigens. Here, we present data from a phase I study conducted with DCP-001 in 12 advanced-stage elderly AML patients. Patients enrolled were in complete remission (CR1/CR2) (n = 5) or had smoldering disease (n = 7). All patients were at high risk of relapse and ineligible for post-remission intensification therapies. A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design with extension to six patients in the highest dose was performed. Patients received four biweekly intradermal DCP-001 injections at different dose levels (10, 25, and 50 million cells DCP-001) and were monitored for clinical and immunological responses. Primary objectives of the study (feasibility and safety) were achieved with 10/12 patients completing the vaccination program. Treatment was well tolerated. A clear-cut distinction between patients with and without detectable circulating leukemic blasts during the vaccination period was noted. Patients with no circulating blasts showed an unusually prolonged survival [median overall survival 36 months (range 7-63) from the start of vaccination] whereas patients with circulating blasts, died within 6 months. Long-term survival was correlated with maintained T cell levels and induction of multi-functional immune responses. It is concluded that DCP-001 in elderly AML patients is safe, feasible and generates both cellular and humoral immune responses.",,"['van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A', 'van Wetering, Sandra', 'Santegoets, Saskia J A M', 'Singh, Satwinder Kaur', 'Eeltink, Corien M', 'den Hartog, Yvonne', 'Koppes, Malika', 'Kaspers, Jorn', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'Kruisbeek, Ada M', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D']","['van de Loosdrecht AA', 'van Wetering S', 'Santegoets SJAM', 'Singh SK', 'Eeltink CM', 'den Hartog Y', 'Koppes M', 'Kaspers J', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Kruisbeek AM', 'de Gruijl TD']",,"['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'DCPrime BV, Galileiweg 8, 2333 BD, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'DCPrime BV, Galileiweg 8, 2333 BD, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'DCPrime BV, Galileiweg 8, 2333 BD, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'DCPrime BV, Galileiweg 8, 2333 BD, Leiden, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. td.degruijl@vumc.nl.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article']",20180723,Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,['0 (Cancer Vaccines)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6182404,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Dendritic cells', 'Immune therapy', 'Phase I trial']",,2018/07/25 06:00,2018/10/13 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2017/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/10/13 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00262-018-2198-9 [doi]', '10.1007/s00262-018-2198-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2018 Oct;67(10):1505-1518. doi: 10.1007/s00262-018-2198-9.

This was considered as primary refractory AML (PRR-AML), and still has a dismal prognosis. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation could be the only cure for these patients. However, the role of haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HID-HCT) for PRR-AML is still undetermined. We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 45 adult patients with PRR-AML who underwent HID-HCT, and compared it with the result of 53 patients who received HLA-matched related or unrelated donor transplantation (MD-HCT) during the same treatment period. The 3-year overall survival (OS), leukemia-free survival (LFS), cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR), and non-relapse mortality (NRM) rates in the HID-HCT group were 19.0, 16.5, 70.0, and 35.2%, respectively, but showed no significant differences from the results of MD-HCT. Multivariate analysis showed that complex karyotype with del(7) and time > 6 months from diagnosis to transplantation were associated with lower OS and LFS, and chronic GVHD demonstrated better OS and LFS in the entire cohort. Complex karyotype with del(7) was related with higher CIR and chronic GVHD with lower CIR.

Evidence exists to support replacing photon therapy with proton therapy to reduce the incidence of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in childhood cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to estimate the potential reduction in SMN incidence and in SMN mortality for pediatric medulloblastoma patients in LMICs if proton therapy were made available to them. For nine children of ages 2 to 14 years, we calculated the equivalent dose in organs or tissues at risk for radiogenic SMNs from therapeutic and stray radiation for photon craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in a LMIC and proton CSI in a high-income country. We projected the lifetime risks of SMN incidence and SMN mortality for every SMN site with a widely-used model from the literature. We found that the average total lifetime attributable risks of incidence and mortality were very high for both photon CSI (168% and 41%, respectively) and proton CSI (88% and 26%, respectively). SMNs having the highest risk of mortality were lung cancer (16%), non-site-specific solid tumors (16%), colon cancer (5.9%), leukemia (5.4%), and for girls breast cancer (5.0%) after photon CSI and non-site-specific solid tumors (12%), lung cancer (11%), and leukemia (4.8%) after proton CSI. The risks were higher for younger children than for older children and higher for girls than for boys. The ratios of proton CSI to photon CSI of total risks of SMN incidence and mortality were 0.56 (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.75) and 0.64 (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.82), respectively, averaged over this sample group. In conclusion, proton therapy has the potential to lessen markedly subsequent SMNs and SMN fatalities in survivors of childhood medulloblastoma in LMICs, for example, through regional centralized care. Additional methods should be explored urgently to reduce therapeutic-field doses in organs and tissues at risk for SMN, especially in the lungs, colon, and breast tissues.",,"['Taddei, Phillip J', 'Khater, Nabil', 'Youssef, Bassem', 'Howell, Rebecca M', 'Jalbout, Wassim', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Geara, Fady B', 'Giebeler, Annelise', 'Mahajan, Anita', 'Mirkovic, Dragan', 'Newhauser, Wayne D']","['Taddei PJ', 'Khater N', 'Youssef B', 'Howell RM', 'Jalbout W', 'Zhang R', 'Geara FB', 'Giebeler A', 'Mahajan A', 'Mirkovic D', 'Newhauser WD']",,"['Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut Medical Center, P.O.

Lymphoblastic-leukemia precursors are highly sensitive to oxidative stress. KLF5 is a member of the Kruppel-like family of transcription factors. KLF5 expression is repressed in B-ALL, including BCR-ABL1+ B-ALL. Here, we demonstrate that forced expression of KLF5 in B-ALL cells bypasses the imatinib resistance which is not associated with mutations of BCR-ABL. Expression of Klf5 impaired leukemogenic activity of BCR-ABL1+ B-cell precursors in vitro and in vivo. The complete genetic loss of Klf5 reduced oxidative stress, increased regeneration of reduced glutathione and decreased apoptosis of leukemic precursors. Klf5 regulation of glutathione levels was mediated by its regulation of glutathione-S-transferase Mu 1 (Gstm1), an important regulator of glutathione-mediated detoxification and protein glutathionylation. Expression of Klf5 or the direct Klf5 target gene Gstm1 inhibited clonogenic activity of Klf5(/) leukemic B-cell precursors and unveiled a Klf5-dependent regulatory loop in glutamine-dependent glutathione metabolism.

Objective: To provide an epidemiological overview on a whole year cohort of palliative patients in terms of demography, complaints, and therapy on admission to PCCS and the impact of PCCS treatment, and identify differences and similarities in different palliative patient subgroups. Methods: Chi-square, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis followed by Games-Howell analysis of HOspice and Palliative care Evaluation (HOPE 2013) data on 4 PCCS centers and in total 919 patients, with solid tumors (237), metastatic cancer (397), leukemia and lymphoma (99), neurological (109, mostly multiple sclerosis [MS]), and noncancer, nonneurological disease (NCNND, 77). Results: A mostly uniform block of 3 cancer subgroups in terms of demographics, admission complaints, and initial pharmacological treatment diverged from the neurologic/MS disease subgroup. The ""intermediate,"" NCNND subgroup coalesced with the cancer or the neurologic/MS subgroups in part of the demographics, complaint, and drug parameters. Tetraparesis, requirement for nursing, and help with daily living were more, and pain, dyspnea, weakness, appetite loss, and fatigue were less frequent in neurologic patients compared with the cancer subgroups. Neurologic patients also showed more common use of coanalgetics and antidepressives, less opiates and nonopiate analgetics, corticosteroids, and antiemetics and antacids. NCNND patients had a particularly high rate of disorientation (48%) and death during PCCS (39%). In the 3 cancer subgroups, dyspnea, weakness, appetite loss, and anxiolytic use were less frequent in solid tumor patients. Palliative Care Consultation Service treatment was associated with reduction in symptom severity independent of subgroup entity. All listed differences were significant at P < .05 level. Conclusion: Despite divergence in demographics, symptoms, and medication, the data underline general usefulness of PCCS care in all end-stage patients and not only the cancer subgroups. Nevertheless, the strong differences revealed in the current study also underscore the need for a carefully tuned, disease-specific therapeutic approach to these subgroups of palliative patients.",,"['Basedow-Rajwich, Birgit', 'Montag, Thomas', 'Duckert, Andreas', 'Schulz, Christian', 'Rajwich, Gennadij', 'Kleiter, Ingo', 'Koehler, Jurgen', 'Lindena, Gabriele']","['Basedow-Rajwich B', 'Montag T', 'Duckert A', 'Schulz C', 'Rajwich G', 'Kleiter I', 'Koehler J', 'Lindena G']",,"['Palliative Care Service, Marianne-Strauss Clinic, Berg, Germany.', 'Palliative Care Consultation Service, Department of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Palliative Care Consultation Service, Klinikum Frankfurt (Oder), Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Interdisciplinary Centre of Palliative Medicine, University Hospital Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Palliative Care Service, Marianne-Strauss Clinic, Berg, Germany.', 'Palliative Care Service, Marianne-Strauss Clinic, Berg, Germany.', 'Palliative Care Service, Marianne-Strauss Clinic, Berg, Germany.', 'CLARA (CLinical Analysis, Research and Application) Klinische Forschung, Kleinmachnow, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],20180718,United States,Palliat Care,Palliative care,101634506,,,,PMC6053857,['NOTNLM'],"['Solid tumor', 'complaint', 'leukemia', 'lymphoma', 'medication', 'metastatic', 'neuropalliative', 'noncancer']","['Declaration of conflicting interests:The author(s) declared no potential', 'conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or', 'publication of this article.']",2018/07/25 06:00,2018/07/25 06:01,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2018/05/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2018/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/1178224218785139 [doi]', '10.1177_1178224218785139 [pii]']",epublish,Palliat Care. 2018 Jul 18;11:1178224218785139. doi: 10.1177/1178224218785139. eCollection 2018.,,1178224218785139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to current advances, the European Myeloma Network updated the diagnostic and therapeutic recommendations for patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), AL-amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), POEMS syndrome, and primary plasma cell leukemia. For patients with WM, the combination of rituximab with chemotherapy remains the treatment cornerstone, while the Bruton-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib has been introduced and approved for relapsed/refractory disease. The management of light chain amyloidosis depends on the presence and severity of heart disfunction. If present, intensification with an autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is not recommended. Further aggregation of misfolded light chains could be prevented by doxycycline or monoclonal antibodies targeting amyloid deposits. Initial treatment generally consists of melphalan/dexamethasone or bortezomib-based regimens. For relapsing patients, one can consider proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents, melphalan or daratumumab. Because intact or light-chain immunoglobulins are also the culprits for MIDD, the small monoclonal plasma cells' clones should be treated and generally respond well to bortezomib-based treatment. POEMS syndrome is a well-defined clinical entity that can present as solitary bone lesions or disseminated disease. Radiation therapy is used for patients with localized disease and result in long-lasting response. Systemic treatment should be proposed to patients with disseminated disease, but regimens that can worsen a pre-existing polyneuropathy should be avoided. PPCL is located at the other end of the spectrum of plasma cell disorders and is associated with an aggressive disease course and poor prognosis. It requires an imminent, multi-phase and novel agents-based therapy, including induction, ASCT, consolidation and maintenance, with short treatment-free intervals. Patients not eligible for transplant procedures require personalized, intensive therapeutic approach. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be used in selected patients.",,"['Gavriatopoulou, Maria', 'Musto, Pellegrino', 'Caers, Jo', 'Merlini, Giampaolo', 'Kastritis, Efstathios', 'van de Donk, Niels', 'Gay, Francesca', 'Hegenbart, Ute', 'Hajek, Roman', 'Zweegman, Sonja', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Straka, Christian', 'Dimopoulos, Meletios A', 'Einsele, Hermann', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Engelhardt, Monika', 'Terpos, Evangelos']","['Gavriatopoulou M', 'Musto P', 'Caers J', 'Merlini G', 'Kastritis E', 'van de Donk N', 'Gay F', 'Hegenbart U', 'Hajek R', 'Zweegman S', 'Bruno B', 'Straka C', 'Dimopoulos MA', 'Einsele H', 'Boccadoro M', 'Sonneveld P', 'Engelhardt M', 'Terpos E']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8191-5832'],"['Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Scientific Direction, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilacata, Rionero in Vulture (Pz), Vulture, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', ""Department of Molecular Medicine, Amyloidosis Research and Treatment Center, Foundation 'Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico (IRCCS) Policlinico San Matteo', University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy."", 'Department of Clinical Therapeutics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, School of Medicine, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Cancer Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Hematology, S.

Clonal evolution likely has therapeutic implications but its dynamic is less well studied. We studied clonal composition and prognostic value of seven recurrently mutated driver genes using targeted next-generation sequencing in 643 CLL patients and found higher frequencies of mutations in TP53 (35 vs. 12%, p < 0.001) and SF3B1 (20 vs. 11%, p < 0.05) and increased number of (sub)clonal (p < 0.0001) mutations in treated patients. We next performed an in-depth evaluation of clonal evolution on untreated CLL patients (50 ""progressors"" and 17 matched ""non-progressors"") using a 404 gene-sequencing panel and identified novel mutated genes such as AXIN1, SDHA, SUZ12, and FOXO3. Progressors carried more mutations at initial presentation (2.5 vs. 1, p < 0.0001). Mutations in specific genes were associated with increased (SF3B1, ATM, and FBXW7) or decreased progression risk (AXIN1 and MYD88). Mutations affecting specific signaling pathways, such as Notch and MAP kinase pathway were enriched in progressive relative to non-progressive patients. These data extend earlier findings that specific genomic alterations and diversity of subclones are associated with disease progression and persistence of disease in CLL and identify novel recurrently mutated genes and associated outcomes.",,"['Leeksma, Alexander C', 'Taylor, Justin', 'Wu, Bian', 'Gardner, Jeffrey R', 'He, Jie', 'Nahas, Michelle', 'Gonen, Mithat', 'Alemayehu, Wendimagegn G', 'Te

In addition, WTAP is also a regulator of the nuclear complex required for the deposition of N(6)-methyladenosine (m6A) into mRNAs, containing the METTL3 methyltransferase. However, it is not clear if WTAP may have m6A-independent regulatory functions that might contribute to its oncogenic role. Here, we show that both knockdown and overexpression of METTL3 protein results in WTAP protein upregulation, indicating that METTL3 levels are critical for WTAP protein homeostasis. However, we show that WTAP upregulation is not sufficient to promote cell proliferation in the absence of a functional METTL3. Therein, these data indicate that the reported oncogenic function of WTAP is strictly connected to a functional m6A methylation complex.",,"['Sorci, Melissa', 'Ianniello, Zaira', 'Cruciani, Sonia', 'Larivera, Simone', 'Ginistrelli, Lavinia Ceci', 'Capuano, Ernestina', 'Marchioni, Marcella', 'Fazi, Francesco', 'Fatica, Alessandro']","['Sorci M', 'Ianniello Z', 'Cruciani S', 'Larivera S', 'Ginistrelli LC', 'Capuano E', 'Marchioni M', 'Fazi F', 'Fatica A']",,"['Department of Biology and Biotechnology ""C.

Here we describe how deregulated Notch3 signaling enhances CXCR4 cell-surface expression and migratory ability of CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes, possibly contributing to ""pre-leukemic"" cell propagation, early in disease progression. In transgenic mice overexpressing the constitutively active Notch3 intracellular domain, we detect the progressive increase in circulating blood and bone marrow of CD4(+)CD8(+) cells, characterized by high and combined surface expression of Notch3 and CXCR4. We report for the first time that transplantation of such CD4(+)CD8(+) cells reveals their competence in infiltrating spleen and bone marrow of immunocompromised recipient mice. We also show that CXCR4 surface expression is central to the migratory ability of CD4(+)CD8(+) cells and such an expression is regulated by Notch3 through beta-arrestin in human leukemia cells. De novo, we propose that hyperactive Notch3 signaling by boosting CXCR4-dependent migration promotes anomalous egression of CD4(+)CD8(+) cells from the thymus in early leukemia stages. In fact, in vivo CXCR4 antagonism prevents bone marrow colonization by such CD4(+)CD8(+) cells in young Notch3 transgenic mice. Therefore, our data suggest that combined therapies precociously counteracting intrathymic Notch3/CXCR4 crosstalk may prevent dissemination of ""pre-leukemic"" CD4(+)CD8(+) cells, by a ""thymus-autonomous"" mechanism.",,"['Ferrandino, Francesca', 'Bernardini, Giovanni', 'Tsaouli, Georgia', 'Grazioli, Paola', 'Campese, Antonio Francesco', 'Noce, Claudia', 'Ciuffetta, Ambra', 'Vacca, Alessandra', 'Besharat, Zein Mersini', 'Bellavia, Diana', 'Screpanti, Isabella', 'Felli, Maria Pia']","['Ferrandino F', 'Bernardini G', 'Tsaouli G', 'Grazioli P', 'Campese AF', 'Noce C', 'Ciuffetta A', 'Vacca A', 'Besharat ZM', 'Bellavia D', 'Screpanti I', 'Felli MP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0317-9854'],"['Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'IRCCS Neuromed, Via Atinense 18, 86077, Pozzilli, IS, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161, Roma, Italy. isabella.screpanti@uniroma1.it.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161, Roma, Italy. mariapia.felli@uniroma1.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180723,England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Cell Movement/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptor, Notch3/*metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism']",PMC6284016,,,,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/03/01 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2017/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/03/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-018-0401-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-018-0401-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2018 Dec;37(49):6285-6298. doi: 10.1038/s41388-018-0401-2.

Cancer cells critically depend on stress-relief pathways for their survival. However, the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional initiation and maintenance of the oncogenic stress response remain elusive. Here, we show that the expression of heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) and the downstream mediators of the heat shock response is transcriptionally upregulated in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Hsf1 ablation suppresses the growth of human T-ALL and eradicates leukemia in mouse models of T-ALL, while sparing normal hematopoiesis. HSF1 drives a compact transcriptional program and among the direct HSF1 targets, specific chaperones and co-chaperones mediate its critical role in T-ALL. Notably, we demonstrate that the central T-ALL oncogene NOTCH1 hijacks the cellular stress response machinery by inducing the expression of HSF1 and its downstream effectors. The NOTCH1 signaling status controls the levels of chaperone/co-chaperone complexes and predicts the response of T-ALL patient samples to HSP90 inhibition.

The RNA expression levels of circRNA-DLEU2, hsa-miR-496, and PRKACB were assessed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The proliferation and apoptosis abilities of the cells were determined by CCK8 assay and flow cytometry analysis. Target relationships between circRNA-DLEU2 and miR-496, as well as PRKACB, were analyzed by luciferase reporter assay and probe assay. Immunoblotting assays were used to detect the protein expression level of PRKACB. We also did in vivo experiments to observe tumor formation after overexpression of circRNA-DLEU2. Our data showed that circRNA-DLEU2 was upregulated in AML tissues and cells, which promoted AML cell proliferation and inhibited cell apoptosis. circRNA-DLEU2 promoted AML tumor formation in vivo miR-496 was inhibited by circRNA-DLEU2 and was downregulated in AML tissues. circRNA-DLEU2 inhibited miR-496 expression and promoted PRKACB expression. miR-496 antagonized the effects of PRKACB on MOLM-13 cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Many pathways have been implicated in regulating HSC development in cell autonomous manners; however, it remains unclear how HSCs sense and integrate developmental cues. In this study, we identified an extrinsic mechanism by which HSC number and functions are regulated during mouse puberty. We found that the HSC number in postnatal bone marrow reached homeostasis at 4 weeks after birth. Luteinizing hormone, but not downstream sex hormones, was involved in regulating HSC homeostasis during this period. Expression of luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) is highly restricted in HSCs and multipotent progenitor cells in the hematopoietic hierarchy. When Lhcgr was deleted, HSCs continued to expand even after 4 weeks after birth, leading to abnormally elevated hematopoiesis and leukocytosis. In a murine acute myeloid leukemia model, leukemia development was significantly accelerated upon Lhcgr deletion. Together, our work reveals an extrinsic counting mechanism that restricts HSC expansion during development and is physiologically important for maintaining normal hematopoiesis and inhibiting leukemogenesis.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.'],"['Peng, Yi Jacky', 'Yu, Hua', 'Hao, Xiaoxin', 'Dong, Wenjie', 'Yin, Xiujuan', 'Lin, Minghui', 'Zheng, Junke', 'Zhou, Bo O']","['Peng YJ', 'Yu H', 'Hao X', 'Dong W', 'Yin X', 'Lin M', 'Zheng J', 'Zhou BO']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-8950-8799'],"['State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China zhengjunke@shsmu.edu.cn bo.zhou@sibcb.ac.cn.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cell Biology, Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China zhengjunke@shsmu.edu.cn bo.zhou@sibcb.ac.cn.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180723,England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Receptors, LH)', '9002-67-9 (Luteinizing Hormone)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Luteinizing Hormone/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, LH/genetics/*metabolism', '*Sexual Maturation', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC6120660,['NOTNLM'],"['*hematopoiesis', '*hematopoietic stem cell', '*luteinizing hormone', '*luteinizing hormone receptor', '*puberty']",,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/17 00:00 [revised]', '2018/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']","['embj.201898984 [pii]', '10.15252/embj.201898984 [doi]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 2018 Sep 3;37(17). pii: embj.201898984. doi: 10.15252/embj.201898984.

We examined outcomes associated with IST and predictors of benefit in a large international cohort of patients with MDS. Data were collected from 15 centers in the United States and Europe. Responses, including red blood cell (RBC) transfusion independence (TI), were assessed based on the 2006 MDS International Working Group criteria, and overall survival (OS) was estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods. Logistic regression models estimated odds for response and TI, and Cox Proportional Hazard models estimated hazards ratios for OS. We identified 207 patients with MDS receiving IST, excluding steroid monotherapy. The most common IST regimen was anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) plus prednisone (43%). Overall response rate (ORR) was 48.8%, including 11.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.5%-18.4%) who achieved a complete remission and 30% (95% CI, 22.3%-39.5%) who achieved RBC TI. Median OS was 47.4 months (95% CI, 37-72.3 months) and was longer for patients who achieved a response or TI.

RNA-sequencing analysis on isolated LSCs confirmed C-type lectin domain family 12 member A (CLL1, also known as CLEC12A) to be highly expressed on LSCs but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or other healthy organ tissues. Expression of CLL1 was consistent across different types of AML. We developed CLT030 (CLL1-ADC), an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) based on a humanized anti-CLL1 antibody with 2 engineered cysteine residues linked covalently via a cleavable linker to a highly potent DNA-binding payload, thus resulting in a site-specific and homogenous ADC product. The ADC is designed to be stable in the bloodstream and to release its DNA-binding payload only after the ADC binds to CLL1-expressing tumor cells, is internalized, and the linker is cleaved in the lysosomal compartment. CLL1-ADC inhibits in vitro LSC colony formation and demonstrates robust in vivo efficacy in AML cell tumor models and tumor growth inhibition in the AML patient-derived xenograft model. CLL1-ADC demonstrated a reduced effect on differentiation of healthy normal human CD34(+) cells to various lineages as observed in an in vitro colony formation assay and in an in vivo xenotransplantation model as compared with CD33-ADC. These results demonstrate that CLL1-ADC could be an effective ADC therapeutic for the treatment of AML.",['(c) 2018 by The American Society of Hematology.'],"['Jiang, Ying-Ping', 'Liu, Bob Y', 'Zheng, Quan', 'Panuganti, Swapna', 'Chen, Ruoying', 'Zhu, Jianyu', 'Mishra, Madhavi', 'Huang, Jianqing', 'Dao-Pick, Trang', 'Roy, Sharmili', 'Zhao, XiaoXian', 'Lin, Jeffrey', 'Banik, Gautam', 'Hsi, Eric D', 'Mandalam, Ramkumar', 'Junutula, Jagath R']","['Jiang YP', 'Liu BY', 'Zheng Q', 'Panuganti S', 'Chen R', 'Zhu J', 'Mishra M', 'Huang J', 'Dao-Pick T', 'Roy S', 'Zhao X', 'Lin J', 'Banik G', 'Hsi ED', 'Mandalam R', 'Junutula JR']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5942-4428'],"['Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.', 'Cellerant Therapeutics Inc, San Carlos, CA; and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],,United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Receptors, Mitogen/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6058235,,,,2018/07/25 06:00,2019/04/04 06:00,['2018/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/04/25 00:00 [received]', '2018/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/04/04 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018020107 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018020107 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2018 Jul 24;2(14):1738-1749. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018020107.,14,1738-1749,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Patients with positive MRD prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) had a significantly higher rate of relapse compared with those with negative MRD (HR = 3.26; P < 0.05). Pre-transplantation positive MRD was a significant negative predictor of relapse-free survival (RFS) (HR = 2.53; P < 0.05), event-free survival (EFS) (HR = 4.77; P < 0.05), and overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.98; P < 0.05). However, positive MRD prior to transplantation was not associated with a higher rate of nonrelapse mortality.

The impact of donor age and donor relatedness on the time from diagnosis to transplant in patients with acute leukemia was examined to clarify the design of future prospective studies that can address optimal donor choice. Files of 100 consecutive patients undergoing transplantation for leukemia were reviewed. Recipients of related donors (RDs) and unrelated donors (UDs) were not significantly different in terms of recipient gender, age, underlying diagnosis, disease risk index, graft source, or donor HLA match. UDs were significantly younger than RDs (median age, 29 versus 51, P < .001). Multivariate linear regression revealed that when controlling for age of donor and recipient, the time from diagnosis to transplant was 35% longer with UDs compared with RDs (P=.018). No significant correlation was observed between donor and recipient age on length of time to transplant (P=.134 and P=.850, respectively), when controlling for other variables. The steps in UD procurement that contribute most to the longer time to transplant relate to activating the donor workup and scheduling the donor workup before cell collection. Understanding sources of delay in the transplant process will help transplant centers and UD registries reduce the time to transplant for patients with acute leukemia and will provide necessary insight for the design of prospective controlled studies that can address optimal donor choice.",['Copyright (c) 2018.

METHODS: We used the Finnish Cancer Registry to identify all patients diagnosed with AGCT in 1968 to 2013 (n = 986). The number of subsequent primary malignancies among women with AGCT and the number of AGCTs in women with previous breast or uterine cancer were compared with the expected number of cases and expressed as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs). RESULTS: There were 122 cases of subsequent cancers diagnosed at least 6 months after the primary diagnosis of AGCT (SIR, 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.3). In particular, the observed number of cancers of the soft tissue (SIR, 4.13; 95% CI, 1.33-12.8), thyroid (SIR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.54-7.62), and leukemia (SIR, 2.67; 95% CI, 0.98-5.82) exceeded the number of expected cases. The SIR for breast cancers after AGCT was 1.26 (95% CI, 0.92-1.73), and the SIR for AGCT after breast cancer was 1.59 (95% CI, 1.04-2.29). The risk for subsequent AGCT was more than 2-fold in breast cancer patients younger than 50 years, and over 15 years after primary diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased risk for thyroid and soft tissue cancer as well as leukemia after AGCT, which may be associated with late effects of carcinogenic treatments and possibly shared risk factors. After breast cancer, the risk for AGCT was higher, which may indicate a shared hormonal etiology.",,"['Bryk, Saara', 'Pukkala, Eero', 'Farkkila, Anniina', 'Heikinheimo, Markku', 'Unkila-Kallio, Leila', 'Riska, Annika']","['Bryk S', 'Pukkala E', 'Farkkila A', 'Heikinheimo M', 'Unkila-Kallio L', 'Riska A']",,"['Obstetrics and Gynecology, and.', 'Obstetrics and Gynecology, and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",,England,Int J Gynecol Cancer,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,9111626,['Granulosa cell tumor of the ovary'],IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Finland/epidemiology', 'Granulosa Cell Tumor/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Uterine Neoplasms/epidemiology/pathology']",,,,,2018/07/24 06:00,2019/07/20 06:00,['2018/07/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/IGC.0000000000001333 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Gynecol Cancer. 2018 Oct;28(8):1529-1534. doi: 10.1097/IGC.0000000000001333.,8,1529-1534,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, such treatment might itself induce sensitization and allergies, thus requiring hypoallergenic vaccine formulations. We here characterized the preventive potential of virus-like nanoparticles (VNP) expressing surface-exposed or shielded allergens. METHODS: Full-length major mugwort pollen allergen Art v 1 was selectively targeted either to the surface or to the inner side of the lipid bilayer envelope of VNP. Upon biochemical and immunological analysis, their preventive potential was determined in a humanized mouse model of mugwort pollen allergy. RESULTS: Virus-like nanoparticles expressing shielded version of Art v 1, in contrast to those expressing surface-exposed Art v 1, were hypoallergenic as they hardly induced degranulation of rat basophil leukemia cells sensitized with Art v 1-specific mouse or human IgE. Both VNP versions induced proliferation and cytokine production of allergen-specific T cells in vitro. Upon intranasal application in mice, VNP expressing surface-exposed but not shielded allergen induced allergen-specific antibodies, including IgE. Notably, preventive treatment with VNP expressing shielded allergen-protected mice from subsequent sensitization with mugwort pollen extract. Protection was associated with a Th1/Treg-dominated cytokine response, increased Foxp3(+) Treg numbers in lungs, and reduced lung resistance when compared to mice treated with empty particles. CONCLUSION: Virus-like nanoparticles represent a novel and versatile platform for the in vivo delivery of allergens to selectively target T cells and prevent allergies without inducing allergic reactions or allergic sensitization.",['(c) 2018 The Authors.

Our specific aims are to describe multi-state models and how they differ from standard survival methods, to illustrate how multi-state models can facilitate deeper understanding of the treatment effect on multiple paths along the disease process that patients could experience in cancer clinical trials, to explain the differences between multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models, and to briefly describe available software to conduct such analyses. Methods Data from 717 newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia patients who enrolled in the CALGB 10603 trial were used as an illustrative example. The current probability-in-state was estimated using the Aalen-Johansen estimator. The restricted mean time in state was calculated as the area under the probability-in-state curves. Cox-type regression was used to evaluate the effect of midostaurin on the various clinical paths. Simulation was conducted using a newly constructed shiny application. All analyses were performed using the R software. Results Multi-state model analyses of CALGB 10603 suggested that the overall improvement in survival with midostaurin seen in the primary analysis possibly resulted from a higher complete remission rate in combination with a lower risk of relapse and of death after complete remission in patients treated with midostaurin. Simulation results, in a three-state illness-death without recovery model, demonstrate that multi-state models and time-dependent Cox models evaluate treatment effects from different frameworks. Conclusion Multi-state models allow detailed evaluation of treatment effects in complex clinical trial settings where patients can experience multiple paths between study enrollment and the final outcome. Multi-state models can be used as a complementary tool to standard survival analyses to provide deeper insights to the effects of treatment in trial settings with complex disease process.",,"['Le-Rademacher, Jennifer G', 'Peterson, Ryan A', 'Therneau, Terry M', 'Sanford, Ben L', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Mandrekar, Sumithra J']","['Le-Rademacher JG', 'Peterson RA', 'Therneau TM', 'Sanford BL', 'Stone RM', 'Mandrekar SJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2234-7430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4650-5798', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2800-6319']","['1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '2 Department of Biostatistics, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA, USA.', '1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '3 ICON Clinical Research, Durham, NC, USA.', '4 Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', '1 Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",20180723,England,Clin Trials,"Clinical trials (London, England)",101197451,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/mortality', 'Models, Statistical', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Survival Analysis']",PMC6133743,['NOTNLM'],"['*Multi-state model', '*cancer', '*clinical trials', '*survival analysis', '*time-to-event data']",,2018/07/24 06:00,2019/10/08 06:00,['2018/07/24 06:00'],"['2018/07/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/08 06:00 [medline]', '2018/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1740774518789098 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Trials. 2018 Oct;15(5):489-498. doi: 10.1177/1740774518789098.

The effect of an aerobic exercise program on the quality of life in children with cancer. Turk J Pediatr 2017; 59: 678-683. Aerobic exercise such as physical activity plays an essential role for a healthy development for children undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of an aerobic exercise program on quality of life in children undergoing cancer treatment. Patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), undergoing chemotherapy, were divided into two groups; the control group received the routine treatment with activities of daily living and the interventional group received routine treatment in addition to an aerobic exercise program. Data was collected using the pediatric quality of life questionnaires (PedsQL version 4) before and after the training program. We enrolled 20 cancer patients, who were referred to Dr. Sheikh Children`s Hospital in Mashhad, Iran; 8 (40%) and 12 (60%) of the patients were female and male, respectively.

PDT uses harmless visible light to activate a tumor-associated photosensitizer (PS). The excited PS generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) that induce damage and death of tumor cells. It is known that certain phytoalexins and phytoanticipins derived from plants often display a PS-like activity due to a phenalenone (PN) moiety-an efficient singlet oxygen photosensitizer-in its skeleton. The aim of this study is to explore the phototoxic properties of PN on the human cell line tumor-derived HL60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia) and to identify the cell-specific targets of ROS involved in the tumor cell death. Our results reveal that PN acts as an excellent PS, showing a potent antitumor cell activity in presence of light. PN-PDT generates intracellular ROS, via oxidation reaction mechanisms type I and II, resulting in an induction of apoptosis. Moreover, both extrinsic (through direct activation of caspase-3) and intrinsic (through mitochondrial depolarization) pathways of apoptosis are induced by PN-PDT. Using pharmacologic inhibitors, we also find that PN-PDT activates caspase-8/tBid and p38-MAPK, triggering the activation of the apoptotic pathways. Although, survival pathways are also promoted through PI3 K/Akt and JNK activation, the net result of PN-PDT is the tumor cell death. The present work identifies to PN, for the first time, as a potent photosensitizer in human tumor cell lines and proposes a mechanism by which ROS induces apoptosis of tumor cell.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Salmeron, Maria L', 'Quintana-Aguiar, Jose', 'De La Rosa, Juan V', 'Lopez-Blanco, Felix', 'Castrillo, Antonio', 'Gallardo, German', 'Tabraue, Carlos']","['Salmeron ML', 'Quintana-Aguiar J', 'De La Rosa JV', 'Lopez-Blanco F', 'Castrillo A', 'Gallardo G', 'Tabraue C']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9920-8116'],"['Facultad de Ciencias, Departamento de Ciencias y Recursos Naturales, Universidad de Magallanes, Punta Arenas, Chile.', 'Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Fisiologia, Genetica e Inmunologia.

The present study aims to determine the level of posttraumatic growth in the mothers of the children with cancer. Methods: In the present descriptive study, the statistical population consisted of the mothers of the children with cancer referring to oncology clinics or hospitalized in the oncology departments of selected hospitals from June 2016 to October 2016. The samples included 180 eligible mothers selected by convenient sampling. The data were collected using ""Posttraumatic Growth Inventory"" (PTGI) that determines the psychological growth following exposure to traumatic events with 21 items in 5 domains of new possibilities, relationship with others, appreciation of life, personal strength, and spiritual changes and scored by 6-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 to 105; the higher scores indicate greater growth. The data were analyzed in SPSS-20 using descriptive and inferential statistical tests. Results: The mean age of the participating mothers was 34+/-5.3, 83.3% of whom were housewives. The majority of the children suffered from leukemia, and cancer onset age was between 3 and 6 in 33.9% of the children. The mothers' mean score of posttraumatic growth was 62.4+/-18.9, and the highest percentage of scores in various dimensions belonged to ""spiritual change"" (3.59), ""appreciation of life"" (3.04), and ""relating to others"" (3.02).

Many such risk factors have been associated with cancer risk in observational studies, and the MR approach can be used to provide evidence as to whether these associations represent causal relationships. MR methods require a risk factor of interest to have known genetic determinants that can be used as proxies for the risk factor (i.e., ""instrumental variables"" or IVs), and these can be used to obtain an effect estimate that, under certain assumptions, is not prone to bias caused by unobserved confounding or reverse causality. This review seeks to describe how MR studies have contributed to our understanding of cancer causation. Recent findings: We searched the published literature and identified 76 MR studies of cancer risk published prior to October 31, 2017. Risk factors commonly studied included alcohol consumption, Vitamin D, anthropometric traits, telomere length, lipid traits, glycemic traits, and markers of inflammation. Risk factors showing compelling evidence of a causal association with risk for at least one cancer type include alcohol consumption (for head/neck and colorectal), adult body mass index (increases risk for multiple cancers, but decreases risk for breast), height (increases risk for breast, colorectal, and lung; decreases risk for esophageal), telomere length (increases risk for lung adenocarcinoma, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, glioma, B-cell lymphoma subtypes, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and neuroblastoma), and hormonal factors (affects risk for sex-steroid sensitive cancers). Summary: This review highlights alcohol consumption, body mass index, height, telomere length, and the hormonal exposures as factors likely to contribute to cancer causation. This review also highlights the need to study specific cancer types, ideally subtypes, as the effects of risk factors can be heterogeneous across cancer types. As consortia-based genome-wide association studies increase in sample size and analytical methods for MR continue to become more sophisticated, MR will become an increasingly powerful tool for understanding cancer causation.",,"['Pierce, Brandon L', 'Kraft, Peter', 'Zhang, Chenan']","['Pierce BL', 'Kraft P', 'Zhang C']",,"['Department of Public Health Sciences and Department of Human Genetics, University of Chicago, Chicago IL 60615.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Department of Biostatistics; T.H.

The expression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-delta (PI3k-delta) is normally restricted to hematopoietic cells and is known as a key determinant of cell survival in certain cancers. The inhibitor of PI3k-delta, idelalisib, has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we report the expression of PI3k-delta and the ability of idelalisib to promote apoptosis in ex vivo ATL samples. The activity of PI3K was quantified by a PI3-Kinase Activity ELISA kit. Although there was no significant difference in mean PI3K activity between healthy donors and patients with ATL, certain cases of ATL showed extremely high PI3K activities. The expression of PI3k-delta protein was detectable in most ATL cases. The freshly isolated cells from ATL patients were cultured with or without idelalisib for 0-10 days, and cell survival was then quantified. Idelalisib induced apoptosis in ATL cells in a time-dependent manner, and significantly reduced the frequency of viable ATL cells at 10 days.

They may be the first manifestation of the disease. A diagnosis on effusion cytology may provide an early breakthrough for effective clinical management. Aims: Study the cytomorphology of HLNs in effusion cytology, determine common types, sites involved and uncover useful cytomorphologic clues to subclassify them. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four biopsy-proven HLN cases with malignant body cavity effusions and 8 cases suspicious for HLN on cytology but negative on biopsy are included in this study. Effusion cytology smears were reviewed for cytomorphological features: cellularity, cell size, nuclear features, accompanying cells, karyorrhexis, and mitoses. Results: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (37%) was the most common lymphoma type presenting as effusion followed by peripheral T-cell lymphoma (25%). Pleural effusion (75%) was most frequent presentation followed by peritoneal effusion (20.8%). Pericardial effusion was rare (4.1%). The common cytologic features of HLNs in effusions: high cellularity, lymphoid looking cells with nuclear enlargement, dyscohesive nature, and accompanying small lymphocytes. Mitosis and karyorrhexis were higher in high-grade HLNs when compared to low-grade HLNs. Myelomatous effusion showed plasmacytoid cells. Very large, blastoid looking cells with folded nuclei, high N: C ratio, and prominent nucleoli were seen in leukemic effusion. Conclusion: HLNs have characteristic cytomorphology and an attempt to subclassify them should be made on effusion cytology. Reactive lymphocyte-rich effusions cannot be distinguished from low-grade lymphomas based on cytomorphology alone.

ALL chemotherapy is associated with numerous side effects including neutropenia that is routinely prevented by the administration of growth factors such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). To date, the effects of G-CSF treatment on the level of mobilization of different stem and progenitor cells in ALL patients subjected to clinically effective chemotherapy have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, in this study we aimed to assess the effect of administration of G-CSF to ALL patients on mobilization of other than hematopoietic stem cell (HSCs) subsets, namely, very small embryonic-like stem cells (VSELs), endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), and different monocyte subsets. Methods: We used multicolor flow cytometry to quantitate numbers of CD34+ cells, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), VSELs, EPCs, and different monocyte subsets in the peripheral blood of ALL patients and normal age-matched blood donors. Results: We showed that ALL patients following chemotherapy, when compared to healthy donors, presented with significantly lower numbers of CD34+ cells, HSCs, VSELs, and CD14+ monocytes, but not EPCs. Moreover, we found that G-CSF administration induced effective mobilization of all the abovementioned progenitor and stem cell subsets with high regenerative and proangiogenic potential.

Individuals carrying variants of genes that encode these enzymes have an altered ability to metabolize xenobiotics which may lead to an increased risk of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene deletions in causing predisposition to adult ALL. Methods: The current case-control study involved 62 adult ALL patients and 62 age and gender matched healthy controls. Whole blood samples processed with standard phenol chloroform protocol for DNA isolation were genotyped using multiplex PCR approach for simultaneous identification of GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletions. The genotype frequency obtained for patients was compared to controls using odds ratio and chi-square. Results: The null genotype frequency of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in a group of adult ALL patients from Pakistan were 47% and 11% respectively. Deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 did not show statistically significant association with adult ALL (p=0.86 and p=0.35 respectively). The combined GSTM1/GSTT1 deletion was observed in 2% patients and was not significantly associated with ALL in adults (p=0.85). Conclusions: The results reveal that homozygous null polymorphism of GSTM1 and GSTT1genes does not influence ALL susceptibility among adult patients. Cancer susceptibility associated with GST polymorphism varies with ethnic and geographic differences. Therefore, further investigation on different populations is needed to understand the role of these genetic variations in modifying adult ALL risk.",,"['Zehra, Alveena', 'Zehra, Sitwat', 'Ismail, Muhammad', 'Azhar, Abid']","['Zehra A', 'Zehra S', 'Ismail M', 'Azhar A']",,"['Alveena Zehra, PhD Student (MSc).

Methods: A retrospective observational study using data from the Premier Healthcare Database between January 2007 and March 2016 was conducted. Inpatient use of posaconazole by formulation and year is described. Separately, four cohorts of patients at high risk of IFI - those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT), and graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) - but without a diagnosis code for IFI during the index encounter were identified as potential candidates for antifungal prophylaxis. Use of antifungal medication(s) in these patients was categorized. Index length of stay (LOS), index hospital costs, and subsequent inpatient and outpatient encounters with IFI at 30, 60, and 90 days post-index encounter are presented by antifungal group for each cohort. The percentage of patients with inpatient and outpatient encounters with IFI at 90 days post-index encounter was determined for each cohort by year. Results: Use of posaconazole oral suspension increased through 2012, then declined as the tablet formulation became available in 2013. A total of 19,872 AML patients, 12,125 MDS patients, 14,220 HSCT patients, and 5,431 GVHD patients were considered potential candidates for antifungal prophylaxis; however, a large proportion of patients within each cohort (33%-94%) did not receive any antifungal drug during the index hospitalization. Index LOS, hospital costs, and subsequent encounters for IFI varied among cohorts and by antifungal group. Within each cohort, subsequent encounters for IFI at 90 days post-index encounter fluctuated but remained rare across different years. Conclusion: Over time and as new posaconazole formulations became available, the frequency of use of each formulation changed. In addition, this study suggested a low rate of potential antifungal prophylaxis in high-risk patients.

Although the underlying mechanisms are unknown, damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from septic tissues might be involved. Therefore, we surveyed sera from septic patients for factors that suppress the innate immune response to DAMPs, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP), monosodium urate, and high mobility group box-1. Macrophages, derived from THP-1 human acute monocytic leukemia cells, were incubated with each DAMP, in the presence or absence of sera that were collected from critically ill patients. Secreted cytokines were then quantified, and cell lysates were assayed for relevant intracellular signaling mediators. Sera from septic patients who ultimately did not survive significantly suppressed IL-1beta production only in response to extracellular ATP. This effect was most pronounced with sera collected on day 3, and persisted with sera collected on day 7. However, this effect was not observed when THP-1 cells were treated with sera from survivors of sepsis. Septic sera collected at the time of admission (day 1) also diminished intracellular levels of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate and cytosolic calcium (P < 0.01), both of which are essential for ATP signaling. Finally, activated caspase-1 was significantly diminished in cells exposed to sera collected on day 7 (P < 0.05).

The thiotepa-busulfan-fludarabine (TBF) protocol has recently demonstrated promising outcome in cord blood and haploidentical SCT; however, there is limited evidence about this regimen in transplant from matched siblings (MSD) and unrelated donors (UD). We retrospectively compared outcomes of 2523 patients aged 18-50 with AML in remission, undergoing transplant from MSD or UD prepared with either TBF or BuCy conditioning. A 1:3 pair-matched analysis was performed: 146 patients receiving TBF were compared with 438 patients receiving BuCy. Relapse risk was significantly lower in the TBF when compared with BuCy group (HR 0.6, P = .02), while NRM did not differ. No significant difference was observed in LFS and OS between the two regimens. TBF was associated with a trend towards higher risk of grades III-IV aGVHD (HR 1.8, P = .06) and inferior cGVHD (HR 0.7, P = .04) when compared with BuCy. In patients undergoing transplant in first remission, the advantage for TBF in terms of relapse was more evident (HR 0.4, P = .02), leading to a trend for better LFS in favor of TBF (HR 0.7, P = .10), while OS did not differ between the two cohorts. In conclusion, TBF represents a valid myeloablative conditioning regimen providing significantly lower relapse and similar survival when compared with BuCy. Patients in first remission appear to gain the most from this protocol, as in this subgroup a tendency for better LFS was observed when compared with BuCy.","['(c) 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']","['Saraceni, Francesco', 'Beohou, Eric', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Arcese, William', 'Bonifazi, Francesca', 'Stepensky, Polina', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Pioltelli, Pietro', 'Passweg, Jakob', 'Socie, Gerard', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Savani, Bipin N', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Saraceni F', 'Beohou E', 'Labopin M', 'Arcese W', 'Bonifazi F', 'Stepensky P', 'Aljurf M', 'Bruno B', 'Pioltelli P', 'Passweg J', 'Socie G', 'Santarone S', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Lanza F', 'Savani BN', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6500-9514', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5189-7167']","['Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant, Romagna Transplant Network, Ravenna, Italy.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Paris Study Office, Saint Antoine Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Tor Vergata University of Rome, Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Policlinico Universitario Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Bologna University, S.

In this study, we explored the functional roles of spontaneous Ca(2+) influx for the proliferation and differentiation of a human erythromyeloid leukemia cell line K562. mRNA/protein expressions were assessed by the real-time RT-PCR, western blotting, and immunocytochemical staining. Intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+) ]i ) and ionic currents were measured by fluorescent imaging and patch clamping techniques, respectively. Cell counting/viability and colorimetric assays were applied to assess proliferation rate and hemoglobin synthesis, respectively. Elimination of extracellular Ca(2+) decreased basal [Ca(2+) ]i in proliferating K562 cells. Cation channel blockers such as SK&F96365, 2-APB, Gd(3+) , and FTY720 dose dependently decreased basal [Ca(2+) ]i . A spontaneously active inward current (Ispont ) contributive to basal [Ca(2+) ]i was identified by the nystatin-perforated whole-cell recording. Ispont permeated Ca(2+) comparably to Na(+) , and was greatly eliminated by siRNA targeting TRPM7, a melastatin member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily. Consistent with these findings, TRPM7 immune reactivity was detected by western blotting, and immunofluorescence representing TRPM7 was found localized to the K562 cell membrane. Strikingly, all these procedures, that is, Ca(2+) removal, TRPM7 blockers and siRNA-mediated TRPM7 knockdown significantly retarded the growth and suppressed hemin-induced gamma-globin and hemoglobin syntheses in K562 cells, respectively, both of which appeared associated with the inhibition of ERK activation. These results collectively suggest that spontaneous Ca(2+) influx through constitutively active TRPM7 channels may critically regulate both proliferative and erythroid differentiation potentials of K562 cells.","['(c) 2018 The Authors.

It affects 1 to 1.5 per 1 million people each year. While 50% of cases could be idiopathic, other causes include malignancies, diabetes, pregnancy, infection, and autoimmune disorders. CASE REPORT We report a case of a 90-year-old male who developed a spontaneous hematoma on the dorsum of his right hand, with no prior history of trauma or any other mucosal bleeding. His activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) was found to be prolonged (>180 seconds) with a very low level of factor VIII (0.1%). CONCLUSIONS As workups did not identify the source, including malignancy and autoimmune diseases, of his acquired hemophilia, it is believed to be idiopathic. He was started on intravenous recombinant factor VIIa (NovoSeven) to control the bleeding in combination with an immunosuppressive therapy of cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. In approximately 10% of patients with acquired hemophilia, underlying malignancy, such as squamous cell cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma can present and commonly develop in elderly patients.

However, the hydrolytic instability of chlorambucil is a major limitation in achieving the optimum therapeutic performance. In this work, mesoporous polymeric microspheres were prepared by free radical suspension copolymerization of methyl acrylate and divinylbenzene in the presence of porogen. Chlorambucil was loaded into the mesoporous polymeric microspheres through adsorption of the drug in aqueous media with high loading capacity up to more than 350mg/g. Chlorambucil-loaded mesoporous polymeric microspheres showed sustained release property in media simulating gastrointestinal fluids, with nearly zero order release kinetics. Furthermore, the mesoporous polymeric microspheres as carriers greatly stabilized chlorambucil against its hydrolysis.

The advantages of pyrethroids over other insecticides are that they are relatively non-toxic to birds and mammals and show high efficacy at relatively lower concentrations. DLM may have dual characteristics i.e. at low molar-concentration, it is nontoxic to normal healthy cells but can induce apoptotic cell death in cancerous cells. There is no reported work based on such hypothesis. Thus, this study has been designed to explore the anticancer property of DLM and the mechanism behind the apoptotic cell death by DLM in cancer cell line (Jurkat J6). Molecular docking study indicates that DLM has the greater binding affinity towards MCL-1 receptor. MTT assay has revealed some significant loss in the viability of cancerous cells by DLM. Further estimation of ROS and GSH have shown the significant oxidative stress induced by DLM in concentration-time dependent manner. DLM has also increased the caspase-3 activity and the apoptotic cells significantly while a decrease in interleukin-2 level has also been observed. The pre-treatment with thiol antioxidant and caspase inhibitor has confirmed the role of oxidative stress and the possibility of other pathways. These observations reveal that DLM may act as anticancer agent at lower concentrations (0.1-1muM), though the further detailed investigation is warranted.",['Copyright (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Many studies are done on pancytopenia but very few studies exist in the literature evaluating the spectrum of aetiologies of bicytopenia. To date, no study is available on bicytopenia in adults. We aimed to study the clinico-haematological profile of patients with bicytopenia and to investigate the different aetiologies of bicytopenia. Four hundred patients with bicytopenia admitted to KLE Dr. Prabhakar Kore Charitable Hospital and Medical Research Centre were selected using systematic random sampling and included in the study. Their clinical profiles and haematological parameters were evaluated. Bicytopenia was observed in all ages with the mean age being 30.7 years. The occurrence of bicytopenia in different age groups was 6% in neonates, 7% in infants, 25% in children, 17% in teenagers, 85% in adults and 11% in elderly. The most common bicytopenia observed was anaemia with thrombocytopenia (61%) followed by anaemia with leukopenia (26%) and leukopenia with thrombocytopenia (13%). The male to female ratio was 1.6:1. The most common aetiology of bicytopenia was found to be non-malignant (56%) followed by infectious (31.7%), malignant (8.3%) and drug-induced (4%). Megaloblastic anaemia was the predominant aetiology among the non-malignant group, closely followed by immune thrombocytopenic purpura and alcoholic liver disease. The most common infectious disease was dengue (12%). Signs like lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly were most significantly associated with haematological malignancies (p < 0.001). Pallor, bleeding, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly were most frequent in non-malignant conditions (p < 0.001). Fever and lymphadenopathy were most frequent in the infectious category (p < 0.001). The most prevalent signs in drug-induced aetiology were lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly and splenomegaly (p < 0.001). Bicytopenia is a good haematological indicator for many non-malignant and malignant diseases. Knowledge of its aetiologies can help in the diagnosis and efficient management of patients.","['Copyright (c) 2018 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. Published by', 'Elsevier B.V.

Results: Thirty-seven kinds of clonal variant were detected from 17 patients with CEL, no recurrent mutation site and hot spot region were found. No pathogenic mutation was detected in 19 patients with PDGFRA rearrangement, but pathogenic mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1 and NRAS were detected from 2 patients with FGFR1 rearrangement who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia and 1 patient with PDGFRB rearrangement who progressed to T lymphoblastic lymphoma, respectively. One hundred and two kinds of clonal abnormalities were detected in 49 patients with HES.

Methods: Medical records of 220 APL patients diagnosed and receiving induction therapy in Blood Disease Hospital, CAMS & PUMC from January 2004 to February 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Each patient was evaluated by CDSS, the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostais (ISTH) scoring system for overt DIC and Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare (JMHW) scoring system for overt DIC, respectively. Results: A total of 220 APL patients were enrolled in the study, with a median age of 38.5 (12-70) years, 114 male and 106 female. Among them, 173 were in the low-medium risk group, 47 high-risk group; 11 patients died during induction treatment. The positive rates of DIC diagnosed by CDSS criteria, ISHT criteria, JMHW criteria was 62.27%, 54.09%, 69.09%, respectively. The consistency rate of CDSS and ISTH in diagnosing DIC was 78.10%; the consistency rate of CDSS and JMHW was 88.32%. There was significant difference in PT, APTT, FIB, D-Dimer and FDP in DIC(+) and DIC(-) group by CDSS (all P<0.05), but patients in the DIC(+) group had lower level of D-Dimer than in the DIC(-) group [21.9(1.2-477.1) mg/L vs 26.3(0.6-488.7) mg/L, chi(2)=1.871, P=0.002] by ISTH, and there was not significant difference in APTT by JMHW [27.05(18.0-181.0) s vs 26.15(18.2-35.5) s, chi(2)=1.162, P=0.134]. In this study, both of the gender and age had no difference in the DIC (+) and DIC (-) group by CDSS. Univariate analysis showed that the level of WBC and the percent of abnormal promyelocytic cells in bone marrow when diagnosed were different in DIC (+) and DIC (-) group by CDSS (P<0.05). Multiple analysis showed the level of WBC (OR=3.525, 95% CI 1.875-6.629, P<0.001) was the only independent predictor in DIC diagnosis by CDSS. Conclusion: The sensitivity of diagnosing DIC by CDSS was higher than the ISTH; and the specificity was superior to JMHW.

Methods: Humanized anti-human CD19 antibody with a high affinity was obtained based on mouse anti-human CD19 antibody (FMC63). Humanized CD19 CAR-T cells (hCART19) were constructed through transfection of lentivirus carrying a CAR sequence of humanized anti-CD19 scFv into human peripheral CD3(+) T cells. The ability of hCART19 to kill leukemia cells and secrete cytokines was detected by LDH release assay and ELISA. The in vivo tumor-killing effect of hCART19 was evaluated in a leukemia mouse model. Results: Several different humanized CD19 single-chain antibodies which were constructed by IMGT database were expressed in the eukaryotic expression vector and purified followed by acquiring humanized CD19 antibody (Clone H3L2) with similar binding ability to FMC63. Humanized CD19 CAR lentivirus vector was constructed and transfected into T cells to obtain hCART19 cells. The LDH release experiment confirmed that the killing rate of target cells was increased gradually along with the increased E/T ratio. When the ratio of E/T was 10ratio1, the killing rate of target cells by hCART19 reached a maximum. When Raji cells were used as target cells, the hCART19 cells group had a significantly higher kill rate [(87.56+/-1.99)%] than the untransduced T cells group [(19.31+/-1.16)%] and the control virus transduced T cells group [(21.35+/-1.19)%](P<0.001). ELISA analysis showed that the secretion of IL-2 [ (10.56+/-0.88) pg/ml] and IFN-gamma [ (199.02+/-12.66) pg/ml] in the hCART19 cells group were significantly higher than those in the untransduced T cells group [IL-2: (3.55+/-0.26) pg/ml; IFN-gamma: (37.63+/-0.85) pg/ml] and the control virus transduced T cells group [IL-2: (2.92+/-0.32) pg/ml; IFN-gamma: (52.07+/-3.33) pg/ml](P<0.001). The above experiments also showed similar results when CHO-K1-CD19 cells were used as target cells. Moreover, in a human leukemia xenograft animal model, the results showed that mice in the untransduced T cells group and the control virus transduced T cells group all died within 20 to 30 days, and the hCART19 cell group survived >40 days, which was more than the survival time of the other two groups of mice.

Methods: We evaluated BM ancillary testing performed in cases with isolated eosinophilia and otherwise morphologically unremarkable BM. Cases with abnormal morphology (eg, dysplasia, basophilia) and/or findings suggestive of a disorder (eg, unexplained thromboses, lymphoma) are specifically excluded. Results: A total of 132 cases met inclusion criteria. Ten cases had an ancillary testing abnormality that warranted a more specific hematologic diagnosis: four cases of lymphocytic variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome, three cases of myeloid neoplasm with PDGFRA rearrangement, and one case each of myeloid neoplasm with PDGFRB rearrangement, chronic eosinophilic leukemia, and morphologically occult systemic mastocytosis. No cases revealed a cryptic PDGFRB or BCR/ABL1 rearrangement or JAK2 V617F mutation. Conclusions: Findings from our institutional experience support initial testing in isolated eosinophilia with otherwise unremarkable BM to include PDGFRA rearrangement, tryptase/CD25 immunohistochemistry, cytogenetics, and T-cell flow cytometry/receptor gene rearrangement.

In this study we sought to address mutational intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). ATL is a malignancy with an incompletely understood molecular pathogenesis caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). To determine the clonal structure through tumor genetic diversity profiles, we investigated 142 whole-exome sequencing data of tumor and matched normal samples from 71 ATL patients. Based on SciClone analysis, the ATL samples showed a wide spectrum of modes over clonal/subclonal frequencies ranging from one to nine clusters. The average number of clusters was six across samples, but the number of clusters differed among different samples. Of these ATL samples, 94% had more than two clusters. Aggressive ATL cases had slightly more clonal clusters than indolent types, indicating the presence of ITH during earlier stages of disease. The known significantly mutated genes in ATL were frequently clustered together and possibly coexisted in the same clone. IRF4, CCR4, TP53, and PLCG1 mutations were almost clustered in subclones with a moderate variant allele frequency (VAF), whereas HLA-B, CARD11, and NOTCH1 mutations were clustered in subclones with lower VAFs. Taken together, these results show that ATL displays a high degree of ITH and a complex subclonal structure. Our findings suggest that clonal/subclonal architecture might be a useful measure for prognostic purposes and personalized assessment of the therapeutic response.",['Copyright (c) 2018 The Authors.

Among these patients, 31 (31.6%) had more than 5% marrow blasts at time of transplantation and 67 patients were in morphologic remission: MRD negative status at time of conditioning was achieved in 39 patients (39.8%), whereas 28 (28.6%) remained carriers of any other positive MRD level in the bone marrow. Three-year relapse estimates of patients with MRD-positive remission was 22.0%, which was remarkably lower than patients with active disease (45.4%, P=.027) but approximate to that of patients in MRD-negative remission (15.5%, P=.522). There were no significant differences in terms of 3-year estimated overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between MRD-positive remission and MRD-negative remission groups (71.4% versus 79.1% [P=.562] and 67.9% versus 76.9% [P=.634], respectively). Moreover, the estimated rates of 3-year OS and DFS of patients in MRD-positive remission were significantly better than those in patients with active disease (71.4% versus 41.9% [P=.033] and 67.9% versus 38.7% [P=.037], respectively).
