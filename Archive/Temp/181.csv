Only allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) offers a long-term cure. In the absence of an HLA-matched family donor, early SCT from an unrelated donor will be the treatment of choice for most children. With clear evidence of a graft-versus-leukemia effect and a high post-transplant relapse rate, outcome of SCT will depend, in part, on the management of immunosuppression during the procedure. The impact of pretransplant cytoreductive treatment, such as intensive chemotherapy, splenectomy, or 13-cis retinoic acid, is unclear. Hypersensitivity for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and pathologic activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway play an important role in the pathophysiology of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia and will provide the opportunity for several novel therapy approaches.","['Niemeyer, Charlotte Marie', 'Kratz, Christian']","['Niemeyer CM', 'Kratz C']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Mathildenstrasse 1, 79106 Freiburg, Germany. niemeyer@kikli.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Treat Options Oncol,Current treatment options in oncology,100900946,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology/therapy', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/pathology/therapy']",41,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s11864-003-0021-z [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Treat Options Oncol. 2003 Jun;4(3):203-10. doi: 10.1007/s11864-003-0021-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, efforts to manipulate expression of the human CD40L (hCD40L) molecule have foundered on problems associated with lack of consistent gene transfer into the malignant target cells. We now describe a new, highly reproducible method for inducing hCD40L surface expression on malignant B cells, which is dependent on intercellular transfer of the hCD40L protein from donor gene-modified fibroblasts to patient tumor cells. Ten B-CLL samples were cocultured with MRC-5 fibroblasts (a human embryonic lung cell line) previously transduced with an adenoviral vector encoding the hCD40L gene. The malignant cells expressed high levels of surface hCD40L, B7-1, B7-2, and ICAM-1 after coculture. Upregulation of B7-1 and B7-2 was cycloheximide inhibitable and was a consequence of CD40 activation. However, inhibition of protein synthesis had no effect on the ability of B-CLL cells to acquire surface expression of hCD40L. hCD40L surface expression required cell-to-cell contact, but was independent of CD40 engagement. hCD40L transfer was not mediated by membrane fusion. The transferred hCD40L was functionally intact and B-CLL cells expressing this molecule induced increased interferon-gamma production from autologous peripheral blood T lymphocytes. This approach does not use any direct gene transfer to primary leukemia cells and can readily be scaled up for production of clinical B-CLL vaccines.","['Biagi, Ettore', 'Yvon, Eric', 'Dotti, Gianpietro', 'Amrolia, Persis J', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Popat, Uday', 'Marini, Frank', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Brenner, Malcolm K', 'Rousseau, Raphael F']","['Biagi E', 'Yvon E', 'Dotti G', 'Amrolia PJ', 'Takahashi S', 'Popat U', 'Marini F', 'Andreeff M', 'Brenner MK', 'Rousseau RF']","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. exbiagi@txccc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', '*Bystander Effect', 'CD40 Ligand/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303403764539332 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2003 Apr 10;14(6):545-59. doi: 10.1089/104303403764539332.,['CA78792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show by comparison of identically designed vector constructs that recombinant retroviral vectors based on FVs were as efficient as lentiviral vectors in transducing nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice repopulating human CD34(+) cord blood (CB) cells. The FV vector was able to achieve gene transfer levels up to 84% of engrafted human cells in a short overnight transduction protocol. In contrast, without prestimulation of the target cells, a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-based lentiviral vector pseudotyped with gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope (GALV Env) was nearly as inefficient as murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based oncoretroviral vectors in transducing NOD/SCID repopulating cells. The same HIV vector pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) achieved high marking efficiency. Clonality analysis of bone marrow samples showed oligoclonal hematopoiesis with single to multiple insertions per cell, both for FV and HIV vectors.

While second-line therapy with alemtuzumab, or other combinations of the above agents, have produced remissions, most of these are partial responses lasting months rather than years. Patients commonly die from progressive disease or infections related to the underlying disease or treatment. The authors sought to develop a novel therapeutic with the capacity to kill chemotherapy-resistant CLL cells and with reduced toxicities to normal tissues.

Biological activity and a partial remission were observed with modest drug-related side effects.

In cells grown in appropriate media the phenolics curcumin, yakuchinone B, resveratrol and capsaicin exhibited growth inhibition as assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. It was evident from the results of the MTT reduction assay and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into nuclear DNA that the phenolics were cytotoxic and inhibited cell proliferation. Dose response studies indicated curcumin to be most cytotoxic towards HL-60, K-562 and MCF-7 but did not show much activity in HeLa cells. On the other hand, yakuchinone B, although less active than curcumin, displayed cytotoxicity towards all four cell lines. Resveratrol was cytotoxic only in leukemic cells, while capsaicin was marginally cytotoxic. All these phenolics did not elicit any cytotoxic activity as judged by the above parameters towards lymphocytes purified from normal human blood. When cells treated with phenolics were stained with propidium iodide and examined under a fluorescent microscope, characteristic apoptotic features such as chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were observed. Scoring of cells with apoptotic and non-apoptotic features showed positive correlation of apoptotic index with dose of phenolic, and fragmented DNA extracted free of genomic DNA displayed on gel electrophoresis a typical ladder pattern. These phenolics which have human exposure are known cancer chemopreventive agents and their action as inducers of apoptosis in tumor cells suggest their potential use in a strategy for cancer control.","['Roy, Madhumita', 'Chakraborty, Sutapa', 'Siddiqi, Maqsood', 'Bhattacharya, Rathin K']","['Roy M', 'Chakraborty S', 'Siddiqi M', 'Bhattacharya RK']","['Department of Environmental Carcinogenesis and Toxicology, Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute, Kolkata 700 026, India cncinst@giasclo1.vsnl.net.in /rathin_b@yahoo.co.in']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,,,,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2002;3(1):61-67.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only a limited number of patients have such informative chromosomal abnormalities. The prognostic value of immunophenotyping in this disease is still unclear. METHODS: Seven hundred and eighty-three newly diagnosed AML patients treated in the German SHG-AML trials in 1991 and 1996 were analyzed with a panel of 33 antibodies. Expression was correlated to overall survival, complete remission-rate, and complete remission duration, and tested in a multivariate analysis including other clinical and biological markers. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 4.3 years, patients with AML blasts negative for CD9, CD11b, CD13, CD34, and CD41, or positive for CD15, CD33, CD38, CD64, and MPO had superior overall survival. This effect was associated with a significantly higher complete remission rate (CD13, CD34, CD41, and CD64) or a longer complete remission duration (CD9, CD11b, and CD64). Cox-regression analysis, including cytogenetic, morphologic, and biologic parameters showed CD9, CD13, CD34, and CD64 as independent factors for overall survival. These markers were used for a prognostic score. Patients were pooled in three groups with highly significant differences of overall survival. The prognostic relevance of this score was confirmed in patients with normal karyotype and/or in younger patients </= 60 years. CONCLUSIONS: Immunophenotyping is not only helpful for diagnosis but is of independent significance for prognosis, and may be useful for risk stratification in AML patients.","['Repp, R', 'Schaekel, U', 'Helm, G', 'Thiede, C', 'Soucek, S', 'Pascheberg, U', 'Wandt, H', 'Aulitzky, W', 'Bodenstein, H', 'Sonnen, R', 'Link, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Gramatzki, M']","['Repp R', 'Schaekel U', 'Helm G', 'Thiede C', 'Soucek S', 'Pascheberg U', 'Wandt H', 'Aulitzky W', 'Bodenstein H', 'Sonnen R', 'Link H', 'Ehninger G', 'Gramatzki M']","['Department of Medicine III, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.

The expression of Bfl-1S mRNA was detected predominantly in normal lymph nodes and in B-lymphoid leukemia cells.

Here, we report that THAP1 is a novel nuclear proapoptotic factor associated with PML NBs, which potentiates both serum withdrawal- and TNF alpha-induced apoptosis, and interacts with prostate-apoptosis-response-4 (Par-4), a well characterized proapoptotic factor, previously linked to prostate cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. We show that endogenous Par-4 colocalizes with ectopic THAP1 within PML NBs in primary endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In addition, we found that Par-4 is a component of PML NBs in blood vessels, a major site of PML expression in vivo. Finally, we investigated the role of the THAP domain in THAP1 activities and found that this putative DNA-binding domain is not required for Par-4 binding and localization within PML NBs, but is essential for THAP1 proapoptotic activity.

To determine whether the developmental change in EGFRs regulates the change in responsiveness to LIF and BMP, we analyzed cortical progenitors induced to express EGFRs prematurely and progenitors from late embryonic EGFR-null cortex. Premature elevation of EGFRs conferred premature competence to interpret LIF, but not BMP, as an astrocyte-inducing signal. EGFR-null progenitors from late embryonic cortex did not interpret LIF as an astrocyte-inducing signal but responded to BMP4. LIF responsiveness in EGFR-null cells was rescued by the addition of EGFRs but not by the stimulation of fibroblast growth factor receptors. Astrocyte differentiation induced by LIF depends on signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We show that the level of STAT3 increases during late embryonic development in a subset of progenitors. EGFRs regulate this change in STAT3 and increase STAT3 phosphorylation in response to LIF. Increasing STAT3 prematurely with a retrovirus also increased the phosphorylation of STAT3 by LIF. In contrast to the finding with EGFRs, however, increasing STAT3 did not cause LIF to induce astrocytes, although it reduced expression of the neurogenic factor PAX6 (paired box gene 6 ). Our findings show that developmental changes in EGFRs regulate the competence of progenitors to interpret LIF as an astrocyte-inducing signal. EGFRs elevate STAT3 expression and increase its phosphorylation by LIF, but this is not sufficient to change LIF responsiveness to astrocyte induction, suggesting that EGFRs also regulate LIF responsiveness downstream of STAT3.","['Viti, Jane', 'Feathers, Angela', 'Phillips, Jennifer', 'Lillien, Laura']","['Viti J', 'Feathers A', 'Phillips J', 'Lillien L']","['Department of Neurobiology and Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cerebral Cortex/drug effects/embryology/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Eye Proteins', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'PAX6 Transcription Factor', 'Paired Box Transcription Factors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/05/31 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['23/8/3385 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2003 Apr 15;23(8):3385-93.,"['R01 NS038306/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS38306/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (PAX6 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Paired Box Transcription Factors)', '0 (Pax6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,PMC6742320,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To detect genomic aberrations underlying the acquired drug resistance, we examined three cultured human myelomonocytic leukemia cell sublines each resistant to adriamycin (ADR), 1-beta-1-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C), or vincristine (VCR), using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RT-PCR, and western blot techniques. Chromosomes 7, 10 and 16 most conspicuously showed frequent aberrations among the resistant sublines as compared to the parental KY-821 cell line. In ADR-resistant cells, gains at 7q21, 16p12, 16p13.1-13.3, 16q11.1-q12.1, and losses at 7p22-pter, 7q36-qter, 10p12, 10p11.2-pter, 10q21-q25, 10q26-qter were notable. In ara-C-resistant cells, no remarkable gain or loss on chromosome 7, but losses at 10p14-pter, 10q26-qter and 16p11.2-p11.3 were observed. In VCR-resistant cells, gain at 7q21 and losses at 10p11-p13, 10p15 and 16p11.2-p13.3 were found. FISH identified amplified signals for the MDR-1 gene located at 7q21.1 in ADR- and VCR- but not ara-C-resistant cells, and for the MRP-1 gene located at 16p13.1 in ADR-resistant cells. These findings were validated at the mRNA and protein levels. Overlapping of the amplified MRP-1 gene with MDR-1 gene may play a critical part in the acquisition of resistance to ADR. Resistance to ara-C excluded MDR-1 gene involvement and highlighted other key genes such as MXR gene. Several other genes putatively involved in the development of drug resistance might lie in other aberrated chromosomal regions.","['Shimizu, Hajime', 'Fukuda, Takeaki', 'Ghazizadeh, Mohammad', 'Nagashima, Mikio', 'Kawanami, Oichi', 'Suzuki, Toshimitsu']","['Shimizu H', 'Fukuda T', 'Ghazizadeh M', 'Nagashima M', 'Kawanami O', 'Suzuki T']","['The Department of Molecular Pathology, Institute of Gerontology, Nippon Medical School, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki 211-8533, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Leukemia/*genetics/metabolism', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/metabolism', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2003/04/30 05:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/04/30 05:00'],"['2003/04/30 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01336.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2002 Aug;93(8):902-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2002.tb01336.x.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,PMC5927113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deletions encompassing ABL-BCR were detected in 37% of patients, consistent with a model in which a greater number of chromosome breaks increases the risk of genomic loss. The components of ABL-BCR were physically separated in a further 52% of patients while fused in the remaining 11%. Evolution from classical to vPh was demonstrated in three patients. The difference in survival, as indicated by Kaplan-Meier analysis, was marked between classical and vPh patients (105 vs 60 months respectively; P = 0.0002). Importantly, this difference disappeared when patients with deletions were removed from the analysis. Our study showed that, despite the existence of several levels of genomic heterogeneity in variant Ph-positive CML, der(9) deletion status is the key prognostic factor.","['Reid, Alistair G', 'Huntly, Brian J P', 'Grace, Colin', 'Green, Anthony R', 'Nacheva, Elisabeth P']","['Reid AG', 'Huntly BJ', 'Grace C', 'Green AR', 'Nacheva EP']","['University College London, Department of Academic Haematology, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cohort Studies', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/04/29 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/04/29 05:00'],"['2003/04/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['4291 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04291.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 May;121(3):419-27. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04291.x.,,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIOLOGY AND PATIENTS: Patients with AML are considered to be old, if they have reached an age of > or =60. This is due to patient- and disease-associated parameters, which reveal differences between older and younger patients with AML, but the cutoff is arbitrary. THERAPY: Standard treatment is a dose-intensive chemotherapy for induction of complete remission, followed by different kinds of post-remission therapies. A small percentage of patients can be cured by this approach. The main group of patients, however, will die within the first 2 years after diagnosis due to the disease or therapy-related complications. The improvements in the treatment of patients with AML over the last few years are mainly restricted to the group of younger patients. Due to the small percentage of patients who are cured and the high rate of treatment-related mortality in elderly patients with AML the question arises, which patients benefit from a primary curative approach, and which patients are to be treated primarily with a palliative therapy. The value of a palliative approach has not yet been consistently validated within clinical trials. Therefore a geriatric assessment will be an important tool within clinical trials for elderly patients with AML. PERSPECTIVE: New classes of drugs, such as inhibitors of signal transduction, monoclonal antibodies and inhibitors of angiogenesis, or allogenic blood steam cell therapy after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens might improve therapy in the near future.","['Wedding, Ulrich', 'Bokemeyer, Carsten', 'Meran, Johannes Gobertus']","['Wedding U', 'Bokemeyer C', 'Meran JG']","['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Innere Medizin, Hamatologie, Onkologie, Endokrinologie und Stoffwechselerkrankungen, Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena. ulrich.wedding@med.uni-jena.de']",['ger'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Growth Substances/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/mortality', 'Middle Aged', 'Palliative Care', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Recurrence', 'Stem Cell Transplantation']",78,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00063-003-1244-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 2003 Apr 15;98(4):193-207. doi: 10.1007/s00063-003-1244-2.,,['0 (Growth Substances)'],,,,"['Arbeitkreises Geriatrische Onkologie der Deutschen Gesselschaft fur Hamatologie', 'und Onkologie', 'Osterreichischen Gessellschaft fur Hamatologie und Onkologie', 'Deutschen Gesellschaft fur Geriatrie']","Alte Patienten mit akuter myeloischer Leukamie--Charakteristika der Biologie, des Patienten und der Therapie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This concept, best described with human leukaemia, indicates that stem cell function (whether normal or neoplastic) might be defined by a common set of critical genes. Here we show that the Polycomb group gene Bmi-1 has a key role in regulating the proliferative activity of normal stem and progenitor cells. Most importantly, we provide evidence that the proliferative potential of leukaemic stem and progenitor cells lacking Bmi-1 is compromised because they eventually undergo proliferation arrest and show signs of differentiation and apoptosis, leading to transplant failure of the leukaemia. Complementation studies showed that Bmi-1 completely rescues these proliferative defects. These studies therefore indicate that Bmi-1 has an essential role in regulating the proliferative activity of both normal and leukaemic stem cells.","['Lessard, Julie', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Lessard J', 'Sauvageau G']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Hemopoietic Stem Cells, Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, 110 Pine Avenue West, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, H2W 1R7.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Clone Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/nature01572 [doi]', 'nature01572 [pii]']",ppublish,Nature. 2003 May 15;423(6937):255-60. doi: 10.1038/nature01572.

Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and/or antivirals are typically employed for persistent disease. Chemotherapy is generally reserved as a final option. The role of radiation therapy, and doses required, have not been well established. Low-dose involved field radiation therapy was used in three pediatric bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients with biopsy-proven PTLD. One patient received a matched T-cell-depleted BMT for dyskeratosis congenita. Two patients with acute myelogenous leukemia received an unrelated umbilical cord blood transplant, and a matched-related allogeneic BMT. All patients required intubation for respiratory distress due to PTLD. Initial treatment was discontinuation or decrease in FK-506. Anti-CD20 antibody was started in all patients, and foscarnet in one patient. All patients were treated with three 150-cGy fractions, for a total dose of 450 cGy. Time from BMT to development of PTLD was 4, 2, and 32 months, respectively. Duration of observation on initial medical therapy prior to irradiation was 11 days, 12 days, and 1 day, respectively. The radiation was well tolerated with no acute complications. Two patients were extubated at 8 and 4 days postradiation, respectively. The first patient had complete radiographic resolution of the mass and adenopathy at 4 months after radiation. The second died of pulmonary hemorrhage and disseminated aspergillosis infection, but had significant regression of disease in the irradiated area 15 days after radiation. The third had pronounced shrinkage of his mediastinal mass. A biopsy was taken of a persistent mass 4 months after radiation, with no evidence of lymphoproliferative disease. These cases demonstrate that low-dose radiation for PTLD is effective for palliation and produces a durable response with no acute toxicity.","['Kang, Song K', 'Kirkpatrick, John P', 'Halperin, Edward C']","['Kang SK', 'Kirkpatrick JP', 'Halperin EC']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Duke University Medical Center, Box 3085, Durham, North Carolina 27710, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*adverse effects', '*Lymphatic Irradiation', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', '*Palliative Care', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/05/07 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-200304000-00023 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr;26(2):210-4. doi: 10.1097/00000421-200304000-00023.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The records of the Radiation Oncology Division, Naval Medical Center San Diego were retrospectively reviewed for all patients treated with splenic irradiation (SI) between January 1, 1990 and March 1, 2001. The charts of 17 patients were identified: 5 patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 4 had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 4 had idiopathic myelofibrosis, 2 had polycythemia vera, and 1 patient each had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and acute myelogenous leukemia. Patient ages ranged from 37 to 88 years. Sixteen of 17 suffered from symptomatic splenomegaly. Twenty-six courses of splenic irradiation were delivered to these 17 patients. Treatment courses generally consisted of two fractions of 50 cGy in the first week, two fractions of 75 cGy the second week, and two fractions of 100 cGy the third week. Blood counts were checked prior to each treatment. Seven of the 17 patients died 1 month or less after SI due to the terminal nature of their disease. Twenty-two of 25 treatment courses for splenomegaly resulted in decreased pain and symptoms. Five patients required two treatment courses for splenomegaly, and one patient required five treatment courses. Three of four patients treated for thrombocytopenia demonstrated improvement, but only one was evaluable for more than 2 weeks due to disease-related mortality. Three of five patients treated for leukocytosis had significant improvement. In general, patients suffered few significant complications from this palliative intervention. Splenic irradiation can effectively palliate symptomatic splenomegaly in patients for whom splenectomy is not an option. Retreatment is possible. Splenic irradiation is less effective in the treatment of thrombocytopenia or leukocytosis.","['McFarland, Joel T', 'Kuzma, Charles', 'Millard, Frederick E', 'Johnstone, Peter A S']","['McFarland JT', 'Kuzma C', 'Millard FE', 'Johnstone PA']","['Radiation Oncology, Naval Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92134, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Hematologic Diseases/complications/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Palliative Care', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/complications/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Spleen', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/*radiotherapy', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/radiotherapy']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/05/07 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000421-200304000-00016 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr;26(2):178-83. doi: 10.1097/00000421-200304000-00016.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the utility of a scoring system, first reported by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT). We analyzed the data from 31 patients who underwent allogeneic transplantation at our institution, using the EBMT scoring system. It was based on five pretransplant risk factors: donor type, stage of disease at time of transplantation, age of recipient, sex of donor and recipient, and interval between diagnosis and transplant. Seventeen patients had a risk score of 0-2, and 14 patients had a score of 3-7. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated 4-year leukemia-free (LFS) and overall survival (OS) for patients with a score of 0-2 were 47 and 53%, respectively. In contrast, the estimated 4-year LFS and OS for patients with a score of 3-7 were 10.5 and 10.5%, respectively. Four-year TRM was 47% for the low-risk group (0-2), and 85% for the high-risk group (3- 7).

Following addition of the Abelson (ABL) tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (formerly STI571) to two BCR-ABL-positive cell lines (BV173, SD-1), we observed a dose-dependent increase in CD62L RNA levels of up to 45-fold by a quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction and an increase in the amount of cell surface-bound CD62L of up to 18-fold by quantitative flow cytometry, respectively. These data are validated by an increased CD62L expression in the bone marrow of patients (n=6) with advanced CML who received imatinib.

To investigate the coupling of molecular signaling events activated by TEL/PDGFbetaR to functional responses, we expressed TEL/PDGFbetaR in interleukin 3 (IL-3)-dependent BaF/3 cells using the tetracycline-regulated expression system. Induction of TEL/PDGFbetaR expression led to increased cell survival following IL-3 withdrawal and constitutive activation of protein kinase B (PKB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2), Jun N-terminal kinases 1/2 (JNK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. However, inducible expression of TEL/PDGFbetaR failed to generate factor-independent cells, whereas constitutive expression of TEL/PDGFbetaR did, albeit at low frequency, suggesting the duration of TEL/PDGFbetaR expression is important for transformation. Surprisingly, in cells induced to express TEL/PDGFbetaR, IL-3-dependent growth was dramatically reduced as a result of increased apoptosis of cells receiving combined IL-3 and TEL/PDGFbetaR signals. We demonstrate that TEL/PDGFbetaR expression augmented IL-3-induced activation of PKB, STAT5, ERK1/2, p38, and JNK1/2. Inhibition of neither phosphoinositide-3 kinases nor p38 MAPKs reduced the inhibition of IL-3-driven proliferation observed when TEL/PDGFbetaR was expressed. However, inhibition of MEKs or JNKs partially reversed the combined inhibitory effects of TEL/PDGFbetaR and IL-3 on proliferation and survival. These results suggest that the combination of TEL/PDGFbetaR and IL-3-induced signals activate apoptosis through ERK and JNK MAPK-dependent pathways. Given that in vivo hematopoietic cells are in contact with a variety of cytokines, our results have important implications for cellular responses in the pathogenesis of CMML.","['Wheadon, Helen', 'Welham, Melanie J']","['Wheadon H', 'Welham MJ']","['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2974 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44321-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 15;102(4):1480-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2974.

The object of this study was to evaluate the true impact of HLA-mismatch by using recent data from a homogenous population, excluding HSCT procedures that used graft manipulations, and by considering genotypic matching. Clinical data of 2947 patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT for leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome were extracted from the database of the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation. The main outcome measures were survival and the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The presence of serologic HLA-mismatch, higher age, and high-risk disease were identified as independent risk factors for both shorter survival and the development of grade III to IV acute GVHD. The impact of HLA-mismatch on survival was more relevant in standard-risk patients. These findings persisted when we used genotypic HLA matching. Survival after one-locus-mismatched HSCT was equivalent to that after HLA-matched unrelated HSCT. We concluded that when a one-locus-mismatched family donor is available for high-risk patients, immediate HSCT using this donor is warranted. In standard-risk patients, however, survival after one-locus-mismatched HSCT is significantly shorter than that after HLA-matched HSCT, and the indications for HSCT should be considered carefully.","['Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Hirai, Hisamaru', 'Sakamaki, Hisashi', 'Iseki, Tohru', 'Kodera, Yoshihisa', 'Karasuno, Takahiro', 'Okamoto, Shinichiro', 'Hirabayashi, Noriyuki', 'Iwato, Koji', 'Maruta, Atsuo', 'Fujimori, Yoshihiro', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Matsuo, Keitaro', 'Hamajima, Nobuyuki', 'Imamura, Masahiro']","['Kanda Y', 'Chiba S', 'Hirai H', 'Sakamaki H', 'Iseki T', 'Kodera Y', 'Karasuno T', 'Okamoto S', 'Hirabayashi N', 'Iwato K', 'Maruta A', 'Fujimori Y', 'Furukawa T', 'Mineishi S', 'Matsuo K', 'Hamajima N', 'Imamura M']","['Department of Cell Therapy and Transplantation Medicine, University of Tokyo Hospital, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Family', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Siblings', 'Survival Rate', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-02-0430 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44330-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 15;102(4):1541-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0430.

We investigated the cytotoxic effects of various FTIs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), using LAMA cells and marrow cells from 40 CML patients in chronic phase. FTI-mediated cytotoxic effect was observed in LAMA cells and in 65% of primary CML cells, whereas marrow cells from controls were only weakly affected. Cytotoxic effects were partially related to enhanced apoptosis; however, Fas-receptor (FasR) and Fas-ligand (FasL) expression were not modified by FTIs. Susceptibility to FTI-mediated inhibition did not correlate with FasR/FasL expression in CD34+ CML cells. Moreover, intra-cellular activation of caspase-1 and -8 were not altered by FTIs, and their blockade did not reverse FTI toxicity. However, we observed FTI-induced activation of caspase-3, and its inhibition partially reverted FTI-induced apoptosis. FTIs did not modulate bcl2, bclxL, and bclxS expression, whereas they increased inducible nitric oxide (iNOS) mRNA and protein levels, resulting in higher NO production. Furthermore, C3 exoenzyme, a Rho inhibitor, significantly increased iNOS expression in CML cells, suggesting that FTIs may up-regulate NO formation at least partially through FTI-mediated inhibition of Rho. We conclude that FTIs induce selective apoptosis in CML cells via activation of iNOS and caspase-3.","['Selleri, Carmine', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Montuori, Nunzia', 'Ricci, Patrizia', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Serio, Bianca', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Rotoli, Bruno']","['Selleri C', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Montuori N', 'Ricci P', 'Visconte V', 'Serio B', 'Luciano L', 'Rotoli B']","['Division of Hematology, Federico II University, Naples, Italy. selleri@unina.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'fas Receptor/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'rhoB GTP-Binding Protein/antagonists & inhibitors']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0178 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44322-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 15;102(4):1490-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0178.

For the other recently described set of human NKG2DLs, the UL16-binding proteins (ULBPs), expression in vivo is as yet undefined. In this study we investigated expression and function of NKG2DLs in leukemia using a panel of newly generated NKG2DL-specific monoclonal antibodies. We report that leukemia cells from patients variously express MIC and ULBP molecules on the cell surface with MICA most frequently detected. Patient leukemia cells expressing MICA were lysed by NK cells in an NKG2D-dependent fashion. Sera of patients, but not of healthy donors, contained elevated levels of soluble MICA (sMICA). We also detected increased sMICB levels in patient sera using a newly established MICB-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Among the GIMEMA patients who had been treated for breast cancer there was an apparent trend towards early onset primary breast disease. This suggests that there might be common predisposing factors for breast cancer and tAL/MDS. There were also three examples of mutations in the MRE11 gene among the 25 tAL/MDS cases suggesting that defective recombinational DNA repair may promote the development of secondary malignancy. MSI(+) tAL/MDS was significantly associated with previous chemotherapy and the frequency of MSI(+) among radiotherapy patients was considerably lower.

Use of manax and erbisol moderated the immunosuppressive and toxic action of fludarabin, due to which fact infectious complications and drug-induced hepatitis have came to be less common, the patients' quality of life gotten better.","['Klymenko, V I', 'Bazyka, D A', 'Polishchuk, O M', 'Kriachok, I A', 'Martina, Z V', 'Kadnikova, T V', 'Klymenko, S V']","['Klymenko VI', 'Bazyka DA', 'Polishchuk OM', 'Kriachok IA', 'Martina ZV', 'Kadnikova TV', 'Klymenko SV']",,['ukr'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Ukraine,Lik Sprava,Likars'ka sprava,9601540,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biological Factors/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Hepatitis/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*drug therapy', 'Leukopenia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Quality of Life', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ukraine', 'Vidarabine/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2003/04/26 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/04/26 05:00'],"['2003/04/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Lik Sprava. 2003 Jan-Feb;(1):18-20.,,"['0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (erbisol)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,Rezul'taty likuvannia khronichnoho B-klitynnoho limfoleikozu v uchasnykiv likvidatsii naslidkiv avarii na ChAES u viddalenomu periodi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the overall incidence of leukemia has been declining in the United States, recent reports suggest that incidence rates may be increasing for certain age and racial groups. METHODS: Leukemia incidence (including acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], acute myeloid leukemia [AML], chronic myeloid leukemia [CML], and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia [CLL]) and 5-year survival rates were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Specific rates for age (birth-19, 20-44, 45-64, and 65 + years), gender, and race (black, white) were also examined. RESULTS: A total of 66,404 cases of leukemia were identified for the period 1973-1998 in the nine reporting SEER sites. For children younger than 20 years old, the overall incidence rate of leukemia increased significantly (estimated annual percent change [EAPC] = 0.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.1-0.9), whereas the rate decreased significantly among the group 65 years and older (EAPC = - 0.3, 95% CI = - 0.5 to - 0.1). Incidence rates for CLL and CML decreased significantly during this time period, whereas incidence rates for AML remained stable. Children younger than 20 years old experienced a 15% increase in the 5-year survival rates for both ALL and AML when comparing the two 10-year periods of 1974-1983 and 1984-1993. In contrast, there was little overall improvement in survival for adults 45 years and older. In particular, there was a notable decrease in the overall 5-year survival for blacks older than 65 years and for black males older than 44 years. CONCLUSIONS: Although the current study confirmed some of the results noted in other populations, the observed overall decline in leukemia survival for blacks is surprising and warrants further investigation.","['Xie, Yang', 'Davies, Stella M', 'Xiang, Ying', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Ross, Julie A']","['Xie Y', 'Davies SM', 'Xiang Y', 'Robison LL', 'Ross JA']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Distribution', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/pathology', 'SEER Program', 'Survival Rate', 'United States']",,2003/04/25 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/25 05:00'],"['2003/04/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11316 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 May 1;97(9):2229-35. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11316.,['R01 CA-79940/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11316'],,,,,['Cancer. 2993 Aug 1;98(3):659'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic response may continue to improve with therapy. Because early allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) may be associated with a better outcome, early parameters predicting for subsequent cytogenetic responses would optimize the treatment decision-making. METHODS: The current study was performed to analyze whether early cytogenetic responses may be predictive of later major or complete cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate therapy in patients with Ph-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-one patients with Ph-positive, chronic-phase CML after failure with interferon therapy who were treated with imatinib mesylate therapy were analyzed. A persistence of 100% Ph-positive cells after > or = 6 months of imatinib mesylate therapy was associated with a major cytogenetic response rate of 9-13% and a complete cytogenetic response rate of 0-4%. However, a minor cytogenetic response after 3-12 months of therapy still was associated with high rates of major (68-83%) or complete (35-54%) cytogenetic response rates.

Anderson experience.,2218-24,"BACKGROUND: Approximately 20-30% of patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) who are treated with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and an anthracycline develop recurrent disease. It has been reported that arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) is effective in this setting. The authors report the experience of The M. D. Anderson Cancer Center with As(2)O(3) in the treatment of patients with recurrent APL. METHODS: Twelve patients who developed recurrent APL after treatment with ATRA were included. Patients received intravenous As(2)O(3) 0.15 mg/kg per day until they achieved a complete remission (CR) or up to a maximum of 60 days. Their median age was 44 years (range, 26-72 years), and the median duration of first remission was 52 weeks (range, 23-292 weeks). RESULTS: All 12 patients achieved a CR. The median time to achieve CR was 52 days (range, 27-75 days). Seven of 10 evaluable patients achieved a molecular remission (i.e., polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis was negative for the gene encoding fusion of the nuclear receptor for retinoic acid to the PML gene at the time of CR; 70% of patients; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.93), and all other patients had negative PCR results after they received post-remission therapy. All patients received subsequent therapy: Four patients received As(2)O(3) alone, six patients received As(2)O(3) with other chemotherapeutic agents, and two patients received idarubicin plus ATRA without As(2)O(3). Eight patients continued in CR after a median follow-up of 24 months (range, 9-45 months). Side effects were mild, except for two patients who developed Grade 2 and 3 peripheral neuropathy, respectively; one of those patients required discontinuation of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: As(2)O(3) is effective and well tolerated therapy for patients with recurrent APL. Molecular remission may be achieved at the time of CR in the majority of patients, and remissions are durable.","['Lazo, Guillermo', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Thomas, Deborah', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Cortes, Jorge']","['Lazo G', 'Kantarjian H', 'Estey E', 'Thomas D', ""O'Brien S"", 'Cortes J']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

The impact of elevated TA on the course of pediatric patients with acute myeloid leukemia (P-AML) is unknown. METHODS: Using a modified polymerase chain reaction-based, telomeric repeat-amplification protocol assay, the authors measured TA in bone marrow samples from 40 patients with P-AML and, for comparison, in 65 adult patients with AML (A-AML), excluding patients with French-American-British M3 disease. The results were correlated with patient characteristics and survival. RESULTS: TA in patients with P-AML was significantly lower compared with TA in patients with A-AML (P = 0.005). Patients who had P-AML with low TA had a projected 5-year survival rate of 88%, whereas patients who had P-AML with high TA had a projected 5-year survival rate of 43% (P = 0.009). Conversely, patients who had A-AML with very high TA (upper quartile) had significantly longer survival compared with patients who had A-AML with lower TA (P = 0.03). There was no correlation between complete remission rate or disease free survival and TA in P-AML or A-AML. In the A-AML group, when patients were separated by cytogenetic findings (poor prognosis vs. others), it was found that TA was significantly lower in patients with a poor prognosis, but the prognostic value of TA was not independent of cytogenetic status. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest, that for patients with P-AML, bone marrow TA is a highly significant prognostic factor.","['Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Manshouri, Taghi', 'Smith, Franklin O', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Estey, Elihu', 'Kantarjian, Hagop', 'Keating, Michael', 'Jeha, Sima', 'Albitar, Maher']","['Verstovsek S', 'Manshouri T', 'Smith FO', 'Giles FJ', 'Cortes J', 'Estey E', 'Kantarjian H', 'Keating M', 'Jeha S', 'Albitar M']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.

Only limited data have so far been supplied from Southern European countries. We present an analysis of the incidence trend of childhood leukemia in Piedmont (NW Italy) in 1975-98, based on data from the population-based childhood cancer registry. The Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont has been recording cases of childhood neoplasms since 1967. Procedures have been uniform and are based on an active search for cases and relevant information. Only cases with confirmed residence in Piedmont at diagnosis are included. Eight hundred cases of leukemia (622 acute lymphoblastic [ALL], 133 acute nonlymphoblastic [AnLL], 45 other and unspecified) were recorded in the period 1975-98 considered in our study. Incidence trends were analyzed using piecewise regression and Poisson regression, based on annual incidence rates. As results from the 2 analyses were similar, only the former were reported. In the age group 1-4 years, a statistically significant annual 2.6% increase in incidence rate of ALL (adjusted by age and gender; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-4.13) was estimated. There was no evidence of increase in other age groups. During 1980-98, a statistically significant 4.4% annual increase (95% CI 1.86-6.90) was seen for pre-B-All in the age group 1-4 years. An increase was also seen for T-ALL that was not statistically significant. Sensitivity analyses were conducted, with no relevant differences from the main results. Our data suggest an increasing trend in ALL incidence for children between the ages of 1 and 4 years. These results are unlikely to be explained by changes in quality of data or exhaustiveness in reporting in the study period. The results were not changed in the sensitivity analyses we conducted. Possible causes to be investigated include environmental factors, changes in family size and parental age, socioeconomic conditions and geographical distribution of cases.","['Magnani, Corrado', 'Dalmasso, Paola', 'Pastore, Guido', 'Terracini, Benedetto', 'Martuzzi, Marco', 'Mosso, Maria Luisa', 'Merletti, Franco']","['Magnani C', 'Dalmasso P', 'Pastore G', 'Terracini B', 'Martuzzi M', 'Mosso ML', 'Merletti F']","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Regional Center for Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention (CPO Piemonte), Torino, Italy. corrado.magnani@cpo.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Time Factors']",,2003/04/25 05:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/04/25 05:00'],"['2003/04/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11112 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jul 1;105(4):552-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11112.,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies revealed that the immunosuppressive agent, FTY720, mainly induces mitochondria-involved apoptosis in some types of cancer cells, since Bcl-2 overexpression prevents the FTY720-induction of apoptotic stimuli. Furthermore, FTY720 induces G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The present study further examines the correlation between intracellular signaling kinases with FTY720-induced mitochondria-involved apoptosis. 2. Human T cell leukemia Jurkat was exposed to FTY720. Dephosphorylation of Akt occurred in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. FTY720 also induced Bad (Ser(136)) and ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70(S6k)) (Thr(389)) dephosphorylation. 3. FTY720-induced Akt dephosphorylation was not because of Akt upstream phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI 3-kinase) pathway inhibition. 4. FTY720 also induced Akt dephosphorylation in human B cell leukemia BALL-1. BALL-1 cells were resistant to FTY720-induced apoptosis. 5. Okadaic acid (OA) inhibited the FTY720-induced dephosphorylation of Akt and p70(S6k), suggesting that FTY720 promotes Ser/Thr protein phosphatase (PP) activity. 6.

The ability of the PHEA derivatives to solubilize hydrophobic drugs was investigated using paclitaxel, amphotericin B and methotrexate. The results demonstrated that the drug solubility depends on both macromolecule composition and drug physicochemical properties. In particular, PEG/hexadecylalkylamine co-grafting increased significantly the solubilization properties of PHEA for the considered drugs while the conjugation of PEG only did not endow PHEA with drug carrier properties. A stability study carried out with paclitaxel/PHEA-PEG(5000)-hexadecylalkylamine demonstrated that the drug/carrier system is characterized by physicochemical instability, which is strictly related to the incubation pH. However, the carrier was found to partially prevent drug degradation. Investigations performed using murine myeloid leukaemia NFS-60 cell line showed that paclitaxel loaded PHEA-PEG(5000)-hexadecylalkylamine possesses high pharmacological activity with IC(50) value of 22.3 ng/ml. Pharmacokinetic studies carried out by intravenous administration of paclitaxel loaded PHEA-PEG(5000)-hexadecylalkylamine to Balb/c mice demonstrated that the carrier modifies the in vivo paclitaxel fate. In particular, PHEA-PEG(5000)-hexadecylalkylamine prolonged the drug distribution and elimination phase of 6 and 17 times, respectively; in addition, it increased the systemic availability (AUC) by about 30 times.","['Cavallaro, Gennara', 'Licciardi, Mariano', 'Giammona, Gaetano', 'Caliceti, Paolo', 'Semenzato, Alessandra', 'Salmaso, Stefano']","['Cavallaro G', 'Licciardi M', 'Giammona G', 'Caliceti P', 'Semenzato A', 'Salmaso S']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Chemistry, University of Palermo, Via Archirafi 32, 90123, Palermo, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Colloids', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Delivery Systems/*methods', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Peptides/*administration & dosage/*chemistry']",,2003/04/25 05:00,2004/01/07 05:00,['2003/04/25 05:00'],"['2003/04/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365903001214 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00121-4 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2003 Apr 29;89(2):285-95. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(03)00121-4.,,"['0 (Colloids)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (poly(hydroxyethylaspartamide-co-aspartic acid))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While cytokine therapy may amplify natural resistance against minimal residual disease, more robust anti-leukemia reactivity can be provided by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in conjunction with myeloablative, hence hazardous, conditioning, at the cost of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Documentation of the capacity of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) given late post BMT, when patients were off immunosuppression, in early 1987, with successful reversal of relapse and cure of patients fully resistant to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy, with many patients alive and well >10-15 years later, indicated two important facts. First, resistant tumors are unlikely to be cured with higher doses of chemoradiotherapy that may harm the patient but not eliminate all his clonogenic tumor cells. Second, that under condition of tolerance to donor alloantigens, DLI may provide a cure to otherwise resistant patients. These observations paved the road for clinical application of non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST), in the early 90s, based on a two-step procedure, first involving induction of transplantation tolerance to donor alloantigens by engraftment of donor stem cells, following safe lymphoablative rather than myeloablative conditioning. Second, use of donor lymphocytes for elimination of residual tumor or otherwise abnormal hematopoietic cells by immune-mediated graft-versus-host effects inducible by mobilized blood stem cell allografts containing larger inocula of donor T cells, or supported by post-grafting DLI when patients were off immunosuppressive modalities.","['Slavin, Shimon', 'Morecki, Shoshana', 'Weiss, Lola', 'Or, Reuven']","['Slavin S', 'Morecki S', 'Weiss L', 'Or R']","['The Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem 91120, Israel. slavin@huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy/methods', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods']",126,2003/04/25 05:00,2004/01/24 05:00,['2003/04/25 05:00'],"['2003/04/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1040842802001087 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00108-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2003 May;46(2):139-63. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(02)00108-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNase I treatment of Taq DNA polymerase before PCR reduced the product significantly. Moreover, no false positive results were observed when encephalomyocarditis virus RNA was used instead of MS2 RNA as the template.

Recently, it was reported that in SFCMM-3, an HSV-TK-encoding retroviral vector, two cryptic splice sites in the HSV-TK sequence led to the generation of an HSV-TK splice variant (deltaHSV-TK) that encodes a ganciclovir-resistant gene product. In order to quantify wtHSV-TK and deltaHSV-TK RNA levels we have developed two real time Taqman PCR assays. We demonstrate that the sensitivity of both PCR assays is 10(-4). It was found that the splice variant is generated in the packaging cell line and results in approximately 4.8+/-1.9% of virions that contain deltaHSV-TK RNA. After transduction of human T cells no significant increase in deltaHSV-TK RNA could be detected. Thus, at maximum 4.2+/-1.2% of T cells transduced with SFCMM-3 will be resistant to ganciclovir due to this mechanism only. Together, these assays provide a powerful method to monitor patients in future clinical trials.","['Ebeling, Saskia B', 'Eric Borst, H P', 'Simonetti, Elles R', 'Hol, Samantha', 'Garin, Marina I', 'Slaper-Cortenbach, Ineke', 'Hagenbeek, Anton']","['Ebeling SB', 'Eric Borst HP', 'Simonetti ER', 'Hol S', 'Garin MI', 'Slaper-Cortenbach I', 'Hagenbeek A']","['Jordan Laboratory for Hemato-Oncology, Department of Hematology, Rm G.03.647, University Medical Center Utrecht, P.O.

Double-strand pre-processed HTLV-1 3' LTR ends (53-54 bp) were used in an in vitro strand-transfer reaction, together with HTLV-1 purified integrase and using a synthetic double-strand naked DNA oligonucleotide as target. Integration efficiency was measured by a fluorescent PCR assay. No significant difference in the pattern of strand transfer was observed between the distinct patients consensus sequences. For each patient, the effect of acquired somatic mutations was then assessed by comparing the strand-transfer efficiency of the mutated sequences (n=8, each harboring one to two substitutions) with that of the corresponding patient consensus sequence. Five somatic mutations or deletions at positions 7, 10, 21, 30, and 53 from the proviral 3' end did not alter the reaction efficiency. By contrast, a single G-->A transition at position 52 was found to result in 33% gain of function. Furthermore, a C-->T transition at 41 bp from the provirus 3' end decreased the reaction efficiency by 80%. This is the first study investigating the effect of naturally acquired substitutions on the strand-transfer capacity of long LTR sequences in vitro. Disproving the hitherto assumed opinion that integration specificity is restricted to the extreme boundary of the LTR end, i.e. the last 12-20 bp of the unintegrated provirus, the present results demonstrate that naturally occurred substitutions of the HTLV-1 LTR can alter significantly its strand-transfer capacity.","['Leclercq, India', 'Mortreux, Franck', 'Rabaaoui, Samira', 'Jonsson, Colleen B', 'Wattel, Eric']","['Leclercq I', 'Mortreux F', 'Rabaaoui S', 'Jonsson CB', 'Wattel E']","[""Unite d'Oncogenese Virale, UMR5537 CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard, Centre Leon Berard, 28 rue Laennec, 69373 Lyon cedex 08, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Virol Methods,Journal of virological methods,8005839,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Virus Integration']",,2003/04/25 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/04/25 05:00'],"['2003/04/25 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0166093403000521 [pii]', '10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00052-1 [doi]']",ppublish,J Virol Methods. 2003 May;109(2):105-17. doi: 10.1016/s0166-0934(03)00052-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential explanations for these differences include distinct tumorigenic mechanisms and/or altered cellular microenvironments. We previously discovered that the TCL1 (T-cell leukemia-1) proto-oncogene is expressed in a high proportion of AIDS-DLBCL compared to DLBCL cases and that aberrant TCL1 expression causes DLBCL in a new transgenic mouse model. Here, we continue to search for other genes that may contribute to the differential pathogenesis of DLBCL in AIDS. Gene subtraction yielded over 1800 potential AIDS-DLBCL candidates, of which about 50% were unknown and not further considered. The remaining 50% of genes were annotated and, when combined with miniarray screening from multiple patient samples, were reduced to 18 candidate genes for extended analysis. These 18 genes showed distinct patterns of expression in both AIDS-DLBCL and DLBCL samples. However, unlike TCL1, none of these genes was preferentially associated with either AIDS-DLBCL or DLBCL.

Rituximab has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab treatment results in rapid depletion of B-cells and this has led to the consideration of other B-cell disorders as candidates for rituximab therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of rituximab in a variety of such disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), multiple myeloma (MM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) and cold agglutinin disease (CAD). In patients with CLL, increasing the dose and/or frequency of rituximab treatment has given improved response rates compared with the standard dose schedule used in NHL, and combination immunochemotherapy has yielded an overall response rate of 92% (with a 60% complete response rate).

We have previously demonstrated that aggregation of high affinity IgE receptor (FcepsilonRI) induces tyrosine phosphorylation of 3BP2, and overexpression of the 3BP2-SH2 domain suppresses antigen-induced degranulation in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 mast cell line. In this report, we attempt to analyze the biological relevance of 3BP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. By using the transient expression system in COS-7 cells, we have demonstrated that 3BP2 was predominantly phosphorylated on Tyr174, Tyr183, and Tyr446 when it was coexpressed with Syk. An in vitro binding study revealed that phosphorylation of Tyr446 by Syk was likely to create a binding site for the Lyn-SH2 domain in RBL-2H3 cells. In addition, proline-rich region of 3BP2 bound to the Lyn-SH3 domain. Conformational microscopic analysis showed that Lyn and 3BP2 are constitutively colocalized in RBL-2H3 cells. Overexpression of 3BP2 in RBL-2H3 cells resulted in an enhancement of Lyn autophosphorylation. These results suggest that the adaptor protein 3BP2 is a potential regulator of Lyn protein-tyrosine kinase as a ligand of its SH3/SH2 domains in FcepsilonRI-mediated signaling in mast cells.","['Maeno, Koichiro', 'Sada, Kiyonao', 'Kyo, Shinkou', 'Miah, S M Shahjahan', 'Kawauchi-Kamata, Keiko', 'Qu, Xiujuan', 'Shi, Yuhong', 'Yamamura, Hirohei']","['Maeno K', 'Sada K', 'Kyo S', 'Miah SM', 'Kawauchi-Kamata K', 'Qu X', 'Shi Y', 'Yamamura H']","['Division of Proteomics, Department of Genome Sciences, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-1 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Ligands', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'src Homology Domains', 'src-Family Kinases/chemistry/*metabolism']",,2003/04/24 05:00,2003/08/19 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M301201200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86952-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 4;278(27):24912-20. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M301201200.

Developed in the 1950s, the drug is also being used as a treatment for inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. The antiproliferative mechanism of action of this drug and other purine anti-metabolites has been demonstrated to be through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis and incorporation into nucleic acids. Despite the extensive clinical use and study of 6-mercaptopurine and other purine analogues, the cellular effects of these compounds remain relatively unknown. More recently, purine anti-metabolites have been shown to function as protein kinase inhibitors and to regulate gene expression. In an attempt to find small molecule regulators of the orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1, interestingly, we identified 6-mercaptopurine as a specific activator of this receptor. A detailed analysis of 6-mercaptopurine regulation of Nurr1 demonstrates that 6-mercaptopurine regulates Nurr1 through a region in the amino terminus. This activity can be inhibited by components of the purine biosynthesis pathway. These findings indicate that Nurr1 may play a role in mediating some of the antiproliferative effects of 6-mercaptopurine and potentially implicate Nurr1 as a molecular target for treatment of leukemias.","['Ordentlich, Peter', 'Yan, Yingzhuo', 'Zhou, Sihong', 'Heyman, Richard A']","['Ordentlich P', 'Yan Y', 'Zhou S', 'Heyman RA']","['X-Ceptor Therapeutics, Inc., San Diego, California 92121, USA. pordentlich@x-ceptor.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/physiology', 'Mercaptopurine/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 2', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/*drug effects/physiology']",,2003/04/24 05:00,2003/08/19 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M302167200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86937-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 4;278(27):24791-9. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M302167200.

Similar to fulminant HBV reactivation in the general population, OLT under resumption of lamivudine can be life saving. In our case, concomitantly molecular relapse of CML at the time of liver failure was also cleared by OLT, possibly via a 'liver-graft vs. leukemia' effect.

CASE SUMMARY: A 79-year-old woman diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with an acute blastic transformation. She was promptly hydrated, started on allopurinol, and treated with hydroxyurea. About 24 hours later, her biochemistry panel showed parameters consistent with ATLS when compared with pretreatment levels. The second case was a 76-year-old man newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia presenting with high blast fraction. He was given appropriate hydration and allopurinol prophylaxis, and was started on high-dose hydroxyurea treatment. He became symptomatic after 12 hours and results of his blood work were consistent with ATLS. DISCUSSION: ATLS is a well-known metabolic disturbance that occurs after cell destruction of rapidly growing tumors. In standard doses, hydroxyurea leads to cell death in the S phase and is not thought to cause significant cell lysis. However, in large doses, it possibly acts by a different mechanism and had a direct cytolytic effect associated with ATLS in our patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although ATLS caused by hydroxyurea appears to be rare, patients at risk should be closely monitored for this complication. An objective causality assessment using the Naranjo probability scale revealed that the adverse drug reaction was probable between ATLS and hydroxyurea therapy in these 2 patients.","['Seki, Jack T', 'Al-Omar, Hamad M', 'Amato, Dominick', 'Sutton, David M C']","['Seki JT', 'Al-Omar HM', 'Amato D', 'Sutton DM']","['Princess Margaret Hospital, University Health Network, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

By day 841, the bone marrow had 35% blasts. Despite aggressive therapy, including unrelated umbilical cord blood transplantation, the patient developed testicular and bone marrow relapses and died of disease. We conclude that increasing levels of minimal residual disease in cerebrospinal fluid can predict recurrence of ALL prior to clinical and morphologic relapse.

The early identification of lymphoma allows optimal long-term management and prevention of significant morbidity. OBJECTIVE: To show the subtlety of pathologic findings in cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in pelvic lymph nodes and the need for scrupulous attention to detail for diagnostic accuracy. DESIGN: Histologic and immunohistochemical profiles of 18 consecutive cases of small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) incidentally identified in pelvic lymph node dissections were reviewed and compared with 22 cases of benign pelvic lymph node dissections. RESULTS: Malignant nodes were grossly enlarged and averaged 3.2 cm in their greatest dimension. Histologically, 16 of the SLL cases were characterized by diffuse architectural effacement with obliterated sinuses and rare cortical follicles. Twelve of these cases showed evidence of pseudofollicles. Two cases showed an interfollicular growth pattern with occasional small pseudofollicles. In contrast, benign pelvic lymph nodes averaged 1.7 cm in their greatest dimension. Although most were architecturally distorted by fibrosis, all benign nodes were notable for patent sinuses. Immunohistochemistry was diagnostically helpful in several cases with equivocal morphology. All malignant cases had a B-cell phenotype with aberrant coexpression of T-cell-related antigens typical of SLL. CONCLUSION: Incidental low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma identified at radical prostatectomy is often overlooked by both the urologist and the pathologist. Although malignant pelvic lymph node dissections frequently lack overt manifestations of lymphoma, attention to subtle morphologic features coupled with lymph node size and immunohistochemical findings should permit diagnostic accuracy.","['Weir, Edward G', 'Epstein, Jonathan I']","['Weir EG', 'Epstein JI']","['Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Md 21231, USA. eweir@jhmi.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Aged', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Lymph Node Excision/*methods', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pelvis/*pathology', 'Prostatectomy/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/complications/*surgery']",8,2003/04/24 05:00,2003/05/09 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2003-127-0567-ISLCLL [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2003 May;127(5):567-72. doi: 10.5858/2003-127-0567-ISLCLL.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Association with trisomy 12 and atypical immunophenotype.,561-6,"CONTEXT: CD79b is a relatively newly characterized B-cell marker that is expressed in a minority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cases. OBJECTIVE: To systematically correlate CD79b expression with specific morphologic and immunophenotypic findings and trisomy 12. DESIGN: We assessed CD79b expression in 100 consecutively accrued CLL cases that were also analyzed by conventional cytogenetics. Based on the association between trisomy 12 and CD79b expression, we then assessed 43 additional CLL cases with trisomy 12. CD79b expression was correlated with morphology and expression of other immunophenotypic markers. RESULTS: Eighteen (18%) of 100 consecutively accrued cases were CD79b positive. No significant association was found between CD79b expression and atypical morphology. CD79b expression correlated with CD22 and FMC7 positivity. Eight (8%) cases had trisomy 12; 4 (50%) of these were CD79b positive, suggesting an association with trisomy 12. Examination of a second group of 51 CLL cases with trisomy 12 (including 8 cases from the initial study group) showed that CD79b was positive in 26 cases (49%), a frequency significantly higher than that of the consecutively accrued CLL cases without trisomy 12 (P <.05). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that CD79b immunoreactivity is positive in approximately 20% of CLL cases and that expression correlates with trisomy 12 and atypical immunophenotypic findings.","['Schlette, Ellen', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Keating, Michael', 'Lai, Raymond']","['Schlette E', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Keating M', 'Lai R']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas M.

In this study we observed that alpha-hederin caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in apoptosis of murine leukemia P388 cells. In order to evaluate the possible mechanisms for apoptosis, the effects of alpha-hederin on intracellular thiol concentration, including reduced glutathione (GSH), and protein thiols, and the effects of pretreatment with N-acetlycysteine (NAC), a precursor of intracellular GSH synthesis, or buthionine sulfoxime (BSO), a specific inhibitor of intracellular GSH synthesis, on alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis were investigated. It was found that alpha-hederin rapidly depleted intracellular GSH and protein thiols prior to the occurrence of apoptosis. NAC significantly alleviated alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis, while BSO augmented alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis significantly. The depletion of cellular thiols observed after alpha-hederin treatment caused disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (deltapsi(m)) and subsequently increased the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in P388 cells at an early time point. Bongkrekic acid (BA), a ligand of the mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator, and cyclosporin (CsA) attenuated the alpha-hederin-induced loss of deltapsi(m), and ROS production. Thus, oxidative stress after alpha-hederin treatment is an important event in alpha-hederin-induced apoptosis. As observed in this study, permeability transition of mitochondrial membrane occurs after depletion of GSH and precedes a state of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Further, we observed that alpha-hederin caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to cytosol, leading to caspase-3 activation. Our findings thus demonstrate that changes in intracellular thiols and redox status leading to perturbance of mitochondrial functions are important components in the mechanism of alpha-hederin-induced cell death.","['Swamy, S Muthu Kumara', 'Huat, Benny Tan Kwong']","['Swamy SM', 'Huat BT']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Nigella sativa/chemistry', 'Oleanolic Acid/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/chemistry', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Saponins/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/24 05:00,2004/01/15 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1022807207948 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 2003 Mar;245(1-2):127-39. doi: 10.1023/a:1022807207948.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (beta-hederin)', '6SMK8R7TGJ (Oleanolic Acid)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The viral transactivator, Tax is able to mediate the cell cycle progression by targeting key regulators of the cell cycle such as p21/waf1, p16/ink4a, p53, cyclins D1-3/cdk complexes, and the mitotic spindle checkpoint MAD apparatus, thereby deregulating cellular DNA damage and checkpoint control. Genome expression profiling of infected cells exemplified by the development of DNA microarrays represents a major advance in genome-wide functional analysis. Utilizing cDNA microarray analysis, we have observed an apparent opposing and paradoxical regulatory network of host cell gene expression upon the introduction of DNA damage stress signal. We find the apparent induction of cell cycle inhibitors, and pro- as well as anti-apoptotic gene expression is directly linked to whether cells are at either G1, S, or G2/M phases of the cell cycle. Specifically, a G1/S block is induced by p21/waf1 and p16/ink4a, while pro-apoptotic expression at S, and G2/M is associated with caspase activation, and anti-apoptotic gene expression is associated with up regulation of Bcl-2 family member, namely bfl-1 gene. Therefore, the microarray results indicating expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic genes could easily be explained by the particular stage of the cell cycle.

Regulation of PTK activity must be tightly controlled as over-stimulation is known to impair normal cell growth, resulting in oncogenic transformation. Since evidence suggests that dynamic oscillatory behaviour occurs in metabolic control processes, we investigated the patterns of oscillatory behaviour in the total protein content and enzyme activity of PTK exhibited by proliferating and differentiating human acute promyelocytic cells. Distinct rhythmic patterns of oscillatory behaviour were observed in both the amount of extractable protein and PTK enzyme activity. Rhythmic characteristics such as period and amplitude were significantly modulated following treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, an inducing agent.

Continuous exposure of the cells to escalating concentrations of MTX up to 20 microM in the presence of 1000 nM LV resulted in establishment of three MTX-resistant sublines with a wide disparity of resistance degree over a 4 logarithmic range (approximately 40-, 900- and 44,000-fold, respectively). Transmembrane transport of MTX in these sublines was diminished to 52%, 35% and 12%, respectively. Intracellular retention of MTX in these sublines was not different from that of the parent cells. A cell growth study in various concentrations of LV showed that cells with higher resistance to MTX required more LV for optimal growth. In parallel with the resistance levels, there was an increase in mRNA expression of dihydrofolate reductase gene and a decrease in that of thymidylate synthase gene, but no change in that of reduced folate carrier (RFC1) gene, as assessed by northern blot analysis. Sequencing of the RFC1 gene in all 3 sublines revealed a point mutation in codon 47 (TCC-->TTC) resulting in substitution of Phe for Ser residue, and additional deletion of CTG of codon 112 in the subline with the highest resistance. In summary, MTX exposure to CCRF-CEM cells in the presence of 1000 nM LV resulted in the establishment of heterogeneous cell populations with a wide range of transport-mediated MTX resistance, which was associated with differential alterations of RFC gene. These cell lines may serve as models for investigation of the molecular mechanism(s) underlying refractory tumors in high-dose MTX regimens with LV rescue.","['Asai, Satomi', 'Miyachi, Hayato', 'Kobayashi, Hiroyuki', 'Takemura, Yuzuru', 'Ando, Yasuhiko']","['Asai S', 'Miyachi H', 'Kobayashi H', 'Takemura Y', 'Ando Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Bohseidai, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Intracellular Fluid/chemistry', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Trimetrexate/administration & dosage/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2003/04/24 05:00,2003/05/09 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01421.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2003 Feb;94(2):210-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2003.tb01421.x.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (SLC19A2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that evodiamine induced oligonucleosomal fragmentation of DNA in HeLa cells and increased the activity of caspase-3, but not that of caspase-1, in vitro. Both evodiamine-induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activity were effectively inhibited by a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk (z-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fmk). In addition, evodiamine increased the expression of the apoptosis inducer Bax, but decreased the expression of the apoptosis suppressor Bcl-2 in mitochondria.

There are, however, some papers which have not confirmed the prognostic value of malnutrition at diagnosis in children with ALL. Overall, data from 1,123 children with ALL worldwide support the concept of malnutrition at diagnosis being useful as a prognostic factor, whereas data from 1,271 children fail to support this concept. We here critically analyze the information of these publications referring to a total of 2,394 children with ALL. Detailed information was available only from 500 of the 2,394 patients, stemming from six publications; of these individuals, at diagnosis, 376 were well nourished and 124 were malnourished. In this subset of patients, the analysis of the data shows that the 5-year (or longer) overall survival of undernourished children (UNC) was 26%, whereas that of well-nourished children (WNC) was 59% (p < 0.001); along the same line the relative risk of dying during this period was 1.8 times higher for UNC than WNC (p < 0.01; Interval of Confidence [IC] 95%: 1.72-1.88). On the other hand, the censoring time of these 500 children is different: 293 were censored at 5 years after diagnosis, whereas 207 where censored at 8-10 years: The overall survival for each of these periods was also different: 36% versus 2% for UNC (p < 0.001), and 56% versus 63% (p > 0.10) for WNC, data which support the concept that the differences in survival are more apparent in UNC if the period of observation is extended. These data suggest that undernutrition at diagnosis by itself and without interacting with other variables, may be a significant prognostic factor in the long-term outcome of treatment of pediatric patients with ALL. After identifying these variables as important, imaginative approaches to the treatment of cancer in childhood in the years ahead may lead into the improvement of the results of these treatments.","['Lobato-Mendizabal, Eduardo', 'Lopez-Martinez, Briceida', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, Guillermo J']","['Lobato-Mendizabal E', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Puebla, Mexico. elobato@prodigy.net.mx']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', '*Nutritional Status', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",25,2003/04/24 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/24 05:00'],"['2003/04/24 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2003 Jan-Feb;55(1):31-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He had suffered from acute myelocytic leukemia (AML: M0) in November 1994 and achieved the first complete remission (CR) then. His AML relapsed in August 1996, but fortunately he achieved a second CR. Radiographical bone examination revealed osteolytic lesions in his right knee and bone scintigraphy showed uptake in the right knee and the middle part of the left femur. MRI also revealed a low attenuation signal in the left femur. He had no abnormal findings in peripheral blood or bone marrow. Histological examination of the biopsied bone tissue showed a diffuse proliferation of round cells with medium-sized or large nuclei. These cells were histochemistrically negative for myeloperoxidase and naphtol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase, and were also negative for lysozyme, cytokeratin 7, 9, 20, EMA, CEA, CD3, CD79a on immunohistochemistry, but were positive for CD43, CD56.

On the basis of these findings we diagnosed these tumors as granulocytic sarcomas (GS), extramedullary recurrence of AML M7. Although radiation (36Gy) to these tumors brought a temporary relief of the pain, he died of systemic relapse of AML in February 2001. When presented CD7+ AML M0 had been diagnosed, but GS cells were also positive for CD 56 and CD41. Although CD56 had not been examined initially, he might have been had myeloid/NK cell precursor acute leukemia and CD41 might be acquired later in the course of the disease.

In particular, there are two major diseases caused by HTLV-I infection. One is an aggressive neoplastic disease called adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and another is a chronic progressive inflammatory neurological disease called HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). It is still unknown why one virus causes these different diseases. With regard to HAM/TSP, virus-host immunological interactions are an considered to be important cause of this disease. Coexisting high HTLV-I proviral load and HTLV-I-specific T cells (CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells) is an important feature of HAM/TSP. Histopathological studies indicate the existence of an inflammatory reaction and HTLV-I-infected cells in the affected lesions of HAM/TSP. Therefore, the immune response to HTLV-I probably contributes to the inflammatory process of the central nervous system lesions in HAM/TSP patients.","['Nagai, Masahiro', 'Osame, Mitsuhiro']","['Nagai M', 'Osame M']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Kagoshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,IM,"['HTLV-I Infections/epidemiology/*immunology/pathology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 1', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/epidemiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/epidemiology/*immunology/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",57,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2002/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2002/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1080/13550280390194028 [doi]', 'LAL131L8AU9P54K0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2003 Apr;9(2):228-35. doi: 10.1080/13550280390194028.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Examination of peripheral blood demonstrated WBC 6.2 x 10(9)/l with 45.5% blasts at admission. Leukemic blasts with positive peroxidase stain, but negative periodic acid-Schiff stain comprised 91.6% on bone marrow specimen. Surface marker analysis of these blasts showed the following: CD3(-), CD5(-), CD7(-), CD10(+), CD19(+), CD13(+), CD14(-), CD33(+), CD34(+), CD41a(-), and CD56(-). Based on these data, he was diagnosed as having acute mixed lineage (myeloid and B-lymphoid lineage) leukemia. He achieved complete remission (CR) by lymphoid-oriented chemotherapy performed after ineffective myeloid-oriented therapy. After four courses of consolidation chemotherapy for lymphoid lineage blasts, recurrence due to proliferation of myeloblasts had occurred. Thereafter, a second CR was obtained by low dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC) therapy. As this patient was considered to have a high risk of relapse, we selected allogeneic BMT from URD. Severe stomatitis due to methotrexate (MTX) occurred probably due to altered pharmacokinetics usually observed in DS patients. Though acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of systemic skin (grade II) and pneumonia were observed during neutropenia due to the post-conditioning regimen, he could be discharged from our hospital on the 135th day after BMT. On day 205 post-BMT, however, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) occurred as a chronic GVHD disorder. Despite therapy with prednisolone and FK506, he died on day 400 post-BMT because of respiratory failure due to BO. In DS patients, superfluous toxicities due to MTX and AraC treatment have been reported, and these toxicities have been considered due to altered pharmacokinetics in patients with DS. This patient could tolerate the transplant conditioning regimen commonly used in patients without DS.","['Takagi, K', 'Yoshida, A', 'Kinoshita, K', 'Iwashima, D', 'Imamaura, S', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Tsutani, H', 'Ueda, T']","['Takagi K', 'Yoshida A', 'Kinoshita K', 'Iwashima D', 'Imamaura S', 'Iwasaki H', 'Tsutani H', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Shimoaizuki 23-3, 910-1193 Matsuoka, Fukui, Japan. ktakagi@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD/blood', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/complications/*therapy', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/07/08 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2002/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00277-003-0617-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2003 Apr;82(4):236-40. doi: 10.1007/s00277-003-0617-1.

Between October 1998 and February 2002, 46 AML patients were treated with FLAG-IDA (fludarabine 30 mg/m(2), AraC 2 g/m(2) for 5 days, idarubicin 10 mg/m(2) for 3 days, and G-CSF 5 micro g/kg from day +6 until neutrophil recovery). Thirty patients were in relapse after conventional chemotherapy including cytarabine, etoposide, and daunorubicin or mitoxantrone according to the GIMEMA protocols. Four were in relapse after autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation and two after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Ten patients had refractory disease (after 10 days of standard doses of cytarabine, 3 days of mitoxantrone or daunorubicin, and 5 days of etoposide). Recovery of neutrophils and platelets required a median of 19 and 22 days from the start of therapy. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 24 of 46 patients (52.1%) and 3 of 46 (6.6%) died during reinduction therapy: 2 due to cerebral hemorrhage and 1 due to fungemia ( Candida tropicalis). Fever >38.5 degrees C was observed in 40 of 46 patients (86.9%), 27 had fever of unknown origin (FUO) and 13 documented infections; 31 of 46 (67.3%) developed mucositis and 14 of 46 (30.4%) had grade 2 WHO transient liver toxicity. After achieving CR, 11 patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation, 4 patients received autologous stem cell transplantation, 4 were judged unable to receive any further therapy, and 5 refused other therapy. Ten patients are at present in continuous CR after a median follow-up of 13 months (range: 4-24). In our experience, FLAG-IDA is a well-tolerated and effective regimen in relapsed/refractory AML.

Among them, metastatic patients with multiple organ involvement at the time of initial diagnosis have the higher risk of cancer death. Additionally, certain histological subtypes are classically more aggressive, and bilateral cervical lymph-nodes metastases or mediastinal involvement may also impart a poorer overall prognosis. More aggressive therapy to produce undetectable thyrotropin levels is usually recommended, although the benefit of such therapy and how long to maintain thyrotropin suppression has not been definitively established. As about two-thirds of the recurrences occur within the first decade after initial treatment, this first decade seems particularly critical, even if follow-up is necessary throughout the patient's life as recurrences may also occur over several decades. Coupled thyroglobulin (Tg) and Tg antibody (TgAb) assay is the first-line tool in their follow-up. Tg measurement obtained either after LThyroxine withdrawal or rhTSH stimulation may permit the selection of patients for scanning with a high dose of 131-I. When either basal Tg level is high or TgAb increases, it appears preferable to schedule patients directly for 131-I therapy followed by a post-therapy WBS. Therefore, the discovery of foci of 131-I uptake is possible in 60 to 80% of such patients. 131-I therapy is proposed as long as metastases trap 131-I without any limit to the cumulative dose of 131-I, although the risk of leukemia rises slightly above a 500 mCi (18,500 MBq) cumulative dose. But when 131-I post therapeutic WBS is negative, any further administration of 131-I is not justified. Alternative imaging procedure is thus required to detect metastases that have lost their capacity to concentrate 131-I. Conventional imaging with ultrasonography of the neck, a CT scan or an MRI of the neck and the chest and bone imaging, and even non-conventional imaging with other isotope procedures, such as 18-FDG whole-body scanning, are nowadays indicated. The goal is to localize those metastases in order to propose the more adequate therapeutic options.","['Toubert, M-E']",['Toubert ME'],"['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux 75475 Paris cedex 10. marie-elisabeth.toubert@sls.ap-hop-paris.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Endocrinol (Paris),Annales d'endocrinologie,0116744,IM,"['Autoantibodies/blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prognosis', 'Thyroglobulin/blood/immunology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography']",30,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/21 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['MDOI-AE-02-2003-64-1-0003-4266-101019-ART19 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Endocrinol (Paris). 2003 Feb;64(1):68-71.,,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '9010-34-8 (Thyroglobulin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two different types of functionally important FLT3 mutations have been identified. Internal tandem duplication mutations arise from duplications of the juxtamembrane portion of the gene and result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 protein. This alteration has been identified in approximately 20% to 30% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia and appears to be associated with a worse prognosis. The second type of FLT3 mutation, missense mutations at aspartic acid residue 835, occurs in approximately 7.0% of acute myelogenous leukemia cases. These mutations also appear to be activating and to portend a worse prognosis. Identification of FLT3 mutations is important because it provides prognostic information and may play a pivotal role in determining appropriate treatment options. We have developed an assay to identify both internal tandem duplication and D835 FLT3 mutations in a single multiplex polymerase chain reaction. After amplification, the polymerase chain reaction products are analyzed by capillary electrophoresis for length mutations and resistance to EcoRV digestion.

Because of the association of apoptosis with the progression of AIDS, HIV-1-infected T cells or macrophages might be expected to express elevated levels of surface phosphatidylserine (PS), a hallmark of programmed cell death. Virions produced by these cells would also be predicted to have PS on the surface of their envelopes. In this study, data are presented that support this hypothesis and suggest that PS is required for macrophage infection. The PS-specific protein annexin V was used to enrich for virus particles and to inhibit HIV-1 replication in primary macrophages, but not T cells. HIV-1 replication was also significantly inhibited with vesicles consisting of PS, but not phosphatidylcholine. PS is specifically required for HIV-1 infection because viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus G and amphotropic murine leukemia virus envelopes were not inhibited by PS vesicles or annexin V. These data indicate that PS is an important cofactor for HIV-1 infection of macrophages.","['Callahan, Melissa K', 'Popernack, Paul M', 'Tsutsui, Shigeki', 'Truong, Linh', 'Schlegel, Robert A', 'Henderson, Andrew J']","['Callahan MK', 'Popernack PM', 'Tsutsui S', 'Truong L', 'Schlegel RA', 'Henderson AJ']","['Graduate Program in Biochemistry, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA 16802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Binding Sites/immunology', 'Gene Products, env/physiology', 'HIV Infections/immunology/virology', 'HIV-1/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Membrane Fusion/immunology', 'Monocytes/immunology/metabolism/*virology', 'Phosphatidylserines/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Virion/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Virus Replication/immunology']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.9.4840 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 May 1;170(9):4840-5. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.9.4840.,['AI46261/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Phosphatidylserines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

YM-58483, a pyrazole derivative, inhibited an anti-CD3 mAb-induced sustained Ca(2+) influx in acute T cell leukemia, Jurkat cells. But it did not affect an anti-CD3 mAb-induced transient intracellular Ca(2+) increase in Ca(2+)-free medium, nor anti-CD3 mAb-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1. It was suggested that YM-58483 inhibited Ca(2+) influx through SOC channels without affecting the TCR signal transduction cascade. Furthermore, YM-58483 inhibited thapsigargin-induced sustained Ca(2+) influx with an IC(50) value of 100 nM without affecting membrane potential. YM-58483 inhibited by 30-fold the Ca(2+) influx through SOC channels compared with voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels, while econazole inhibited both SOC channels and voltage-operated Ca(2+) channels with an equivalent range of IC(50) values. YM-58483 potently inhibited IL-2 production and NF-AT-driven promoter activity, but not AP-1-driven promoter activity in Jurkat cells. Moreover, this compound inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity in mice with an ED(50) of 1.1 mg/kg. Therefore, we concluded that YM-58483 was a novel store-operated Ca(2+) entry blocker and a potent immunomodulator, and could be useful for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and chronic inflammation. Furthermore, YM-58483 would be a candidate for the study of capacitative Ca(2+) entry mechanisms through SOC/CRAC channels and for identification of putative Ca(2+) channel genes.","['Ishikawa, Jun', 'Ohga, Keiko', 'Yoshino, Taiji', 'Takezawa, Ryuichi', 'Ichikawa, Atsushi', 'Kubota, Hirokazu', 'Yamada, Toshimitsu']","['Ishikawa J', 'Ohga K', 'Yoshino T', 'Takezawa R', 'Ichikawa A', 'Kubota H', 'Yamada T']","['Inflammation Research, Pharmacology Laboratories, Institute for Drug Discovery Research, Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki, Japan. ishikaj@yamanouchi.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Anilides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Calcium/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels/*metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/immunology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Dermatitis, Contact/immunology/prevention & control', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, Reporter/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Intracellular Fluid/drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Ion Channel Gating/drug effects/immunology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Picryl Chloride/administration & dosage', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology/immunology/metabolism', 'Thapsigargin/pharmacology', 'Thiadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.9.4441 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 May 1;170(9):4441-9. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.9.4441.,,"['0', ""(4-methyl-4'-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-1,2,3-thiadiazole-5-carbo"", 'xanilide)', '0 (Anilides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '67526-95-8 (Thapsigargin)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'Z4ZG7O5SZ9 (Picryl Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding to LIFR occurs through a binding site characterized by an FXXK motif located at the N terminus of helix D (site III). The immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domain of LIFR was modeled, and the physico-chemical properties of its Connolly surface were analyzed. This analysis revealed an area displaying properties complementary to those of the LIF site III. Two residues of the Ig-like domain of LIFR, Asp214 and Phe284, formed a mirror image of the FXXK motif. Engineered LIFR mutants in which either or both of these two residues were mutated to alanine were transfected in Ba/F3 cells already containing gp130. The F284A mutation impaired the biological response induced by LIF and CT-1, whereas the response to OSM remained unchanged. The Asp214 mutation did not alter the functional responses. The D214A/F284A double mutation, however, totally impaired cellular proliferation to LIF and CT-1 and partially impaired OSM-induced proliferation with a 20-fold increase in EC50. These results were corroborated by the analysis of STAT3 phosphorylation and Scatchard analysis of cytokine binding to Ba/F3 cells. Molecular modeling of the complex of LIF with the Ig-like domain of LIFR provides a clue for the superadditivity of the D214A/F284A double mutation. Our results indicate that LIF, CT-1, and OSM share an overlapping binding site located in the Ig-like domain of LIFR. The different behaviors of LIF and CT-1, on one side, and of OSM, on the other side, can be related to the different affinity of their site III for LIFR.","['Plun-Favreau, Helene', 'Perret, David', 'Diveu, Caroline', 'Froger, Josy', 'Chevalier, Sylvie', 'Lelievre, Eric', 'Gascan, Hugues', 'Chabbert, Marie']","['Plun-Favreau H', 'Perret D', 'Diveu C', 'Froger J', 'Chevalier S', 'Lelievre E', 'Gascan H', 'Chabbert M']","[""INSERM U564, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, 4 rue Larrey, 49033 Angers, France.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Growth Inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Lymphokines/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Static Electricity', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/08/28 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M303168200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)84684-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jul 18;278(29):27169-79. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M303168200.

However, the nature of the receptor-mediated interactions in this complex has not yet been resolved. To address this issue we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal or BC domain of CNTFR and studied the interactions of CNTFR with LIFR and gp130. We reported previously that the membrane distal cytokine-binding domain (CBD1) of LIFR could interact in vitro with soluble CNTFR (sCNTFR) in the absence of CNTF. Here we show that the CBD of human gp130 can also bind in vitro to sCNTFR in the absence of CNTF. In addition, the gp130 CBD could compete with the LIFR CBD1 for the binding of sCNTFR. Substitution of residues in the gp130 CBD, the LIFR CBD1, and the CNTFR BC domain that are expected to be involved in receptor-receptor interactions significantly reduced their interactions. An NMR chemical shift perturbation study of the interaction between the BC domains of CNTFR and gp130 further mapped the interaction surface. These data suggest that both the gp130 CBD and the LIFR CBD1 interact with CNTFR in a similar way and provide insights into the nature of the CNTF receptor complex.","['Man, David', 'He, Wei', 'Sze, Kong Hung', 'Gong, Ke', 'Smith, David K', 'Zhu, Guang', 'Ip, Nancy Y']","['Man D', 'He W', 'Sze KH', 'Gong K', 'Smith DK', 'Zhu G', 'Ip NY']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology Research Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigens, CD/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Solutions']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M301976200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86125-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 27;278(26):23285-94. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M301976200.

Blood 2001, 97:708-713). Subsequently, we established two novel EBV-positive gammadelta T-cell lines from the peripheral blood of patients with chronic active EBV infection. Analysis of the terminal repeat of EBV showed that the three cell lines consisted of monoclonal populations, and flow cytometry showed that they had a common phenotype of gammadelta T cells: CD3(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CD16(-) CD19(-) CD56(+) CD57(-) HLA-DR(+) T-cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta(-) TCR gammadelta(+). Analysis for the expression of TCR by flow cytometry showed that all three cell lines were Vgamma9(+)/Vdelta2(+), but negative for VgammaI, Vdelta1, or Vdelta3 TCR. Southern blot analysis for TCR genes showed that the three cell lines had a common rearrangement of Vgamma9-JgammaP and Jdelta3 genes. Polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis of the junction between Vdelta and Jdelta genes revealed that the Jdelta3 genes were rearranged with the Vdelta2 genes. In contrast, none of the EBV-negative gammadelta T-cell lines, Molt-14, Peer, or Loucy, which were analyzed for controls, had Vgamma9 or Vdelta2 TCR, or a rearrangement of Jdelta3 genes. These results indicated that Vgamma9-JgammaP/Vdelta2-Jdelta3(+) gammadelta T cells were preferentially affected by EBV and expanded in patients with nasal gammadelta T-cell lymphoma and chronic active EBV infection. Jdelta3(+) gammadelta T cells are known to be a very minor population in gammadelta T cells of peripheral blood, whereas Vgamma9-JgammaP/Vdelta2-Jdelta1(+) cells are the major population. The close association of EBV with this particular gammadelta T-cell population may provide a key to the etiology of EBV-positive lymphoproliferative diseases.","['Oyoshi, Michiko K', 'Nagata, Hiroshi', 'Kimura, Nobuhiro', 'Zhang, Yu', 'Demachi, Ayako', 'Hara, Toshiro', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Matsuo, Yoshinobu', 'Yamaguchi, Tomohiro', 'Morio, Tomohiro', 'Hirano, Atsuyoshi', 'Shimizu, Norio', 'Yamamoto, Kohtaro']","['Oyoshi MK', 'Nagata H', 'Kimura N', 'Zhang Y', 'Demachi A', 'Hara T', 'Kanegane H', 'Matsuo Y', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Morio T', 'Hirano A', 'Shimizu N', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Virology, School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Primers', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Nose Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64297-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64297-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 May;162(5):1629-38. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64297-6.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,PMC1851204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-ALL/LyL) was found to express TCF-1, and we find that 9 of 10 cases of T-ALL/LyL express LEF-1 as well as TCF-1, exhibiting uniform nuclear immunostaining for both transcription factors. In addition, a significant subset of cases of peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), 39 of 81 cases (48%), are immunoreactive for LEF-1 and/or TCF-1, with 36 of 38 cases immunoreactive for both, indicating that these transcription factors are coordinately expressed in PTCL. The vast majority of LEF-1+ and/or TCF-1+ PTCL (34 of 39 or 87%) exhibit a composite Th1 T-cell-like immunophenotype, based on expression of Th1 T cell-associated, but not Th2 T cell-associated, chemokine receptors and activation markers. Of the Th1-like PTCL studied, 33 of 42 (79%) were immunoreactive for LEF-1 and 32 of 42 (76%) were immunoreactive for TCF-1, including most cases of angioimmunoblastic lymphoma and all cases of lymphoepithelioid lymphoma. Surprisingly, none of the 21 cases of Th2-like PTCL studied, all cases of anaplastic large cell lymphoma, were immunoreactive for LEF-1 or TCF-1 (P < 0.0001), suggesting that LEF-1 and TCF-1 transcription factor expression may be lost in Th2 T cells or Th2-like PTCL. LEF-1 and TCF-1 immunostaining can serve to identify specific subtypes of PTCL, and lends support to a bipartite model of PTCL development, based on expression of activation markers.","['Dorfman, David M', 'Greisman, Harvey A', 'Shahsafaei, Aliakbar']","['Dorfman DM', 'Greisman HA', 'Shahsafaei A']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. ddorfman@partners.org""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Adult', 'Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cadherins/genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'T Cell Transcription Factor 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Wnt Proteins', '*Zebrafish Proteins', 'beta Catenin']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64287-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64287-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 May;162(5):1539-44. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9440(10)64287-3.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CTNNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LEF1 protein, human)', '0 (Lymphoid Enhancer-Binding Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T Cell Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (TCF7 protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)', '0 (Zebrafish Proteins)', '0 (beta Catenin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,PMC1851202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phage-derived reagents are likely to have broad applications in diagnostic and research pathology. A critical element in the identification of cell or tissue-type-specific phage is the ability to reproducibly quantify bound or eluted phage at various stages of panning and screening procedures. Traditional biological assays of phage numbers such as plaque counting are commonly applied but are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and poorly reproducible. Moreover, enzyme immunoassays only support a subset of target types. Here, we report on the use of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (M13qPCR) in developing methods for identification of cell- and tissue-type-specific binding peptides. With M13qPCR, we demonstrate a >/=5 log(10) dynamic linear range with high reproducibility and significantly lower coefficients of variation (10 to 20%) than conventional methodology. Using M13qPCR in phage-panning experiments on live leukemia and prostate cancer cells, cancer-binding phage were identified. Similar results were obtained with conventional methodology such as flow cytometry. These results were extended to specific application of M13qPCR in panning phage libraries on tissue sections of prostate and breast cancer. With the PCR-based method, direct quantification of phage bound to tissue sections correlated well with staining intensity and yielded phage that bound to neoplastic and nonneoplastic epithelium. Thus, real-time PCR-based methodology significantly improves a number of aspects of conventional phage-panning protocols. Furthermore, identification of phage that bind specifically to diseased or cancerous tissue sections will likely be facilitated by this PCR-based approach.","['Jaye, David L', 'Nolte, Frederick S', 'Mazzucchelli, Luca', 'Geigerman, Cissy', 'Akyildiz, Adil', 'Parkos, Charles A']","['Jaye DL', 'Nolte FS', 'Mazzucchelli L', 'Geigerman C', 'Akyildiz A', 'Parkos CA']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. dljaye@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Organ Specificity', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9440(10)64275-7 [pii]', '10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64275-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 2003 May;162(5):1419-29. doi: 10.1016/S0002-9440(10)64275-7.,"['K08 DK060647/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK07771/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK60647/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-91435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R33 CA091435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007771/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA091435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Peptides)']",,PMC1851197,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is particularly so when they are quiescent or terminally differentiated and no longer able to divide. However, whole proteins can be introduced into such cells by protein transduction. We have modified the protein transduction domain (PTD) from the HIV-TAT protein used by other investigators. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, we show that this new sequence allows more efficient transduction of recombinant fusion protein into a variety of hematopoietic cells tested compared with the native HIV TAT domain. This is true for peripheral blood CD34+ cells, dendritic cells, granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes all of which are quiescent or terminally differentiated. Furthermore, we were able to transduce myeloblasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In all cell types tested transduction efficiency was almost 100%. Transduction is maximal 15-30 s after addition of PTD or TAT-GFP fusion proteins as tested on quiescent T lymphocytes.

Using nuclear extract from 293 (human embryonic) cells, we mapped a second (non-canonical) Sp1 element to which Sp1 bound with a comparable affinity and which overlaps a functional ets binding site (EBS). Mutagenesis experiments revealed that the binding of ets to the EBS activates the promoter synergistically with Sp1 bound at the downstream site; however, binding of Sp1 to the EBS does not contribute to promoter activity. A further increase in Sp1 by inducible expression in recombinant 293 cells resulted in a small but significant decrease in the hFR-gamma promoter activity, but the decrease was abolished when the EBS was deleted from the promoter. In 293 cells, which do not express hFR-gamma, the Sp1 level was relatively high whereas in the hFR-gamma-positive HL60 leukemia cells, the Sp1 level was low and the EBS predominantly bound an ets protein. To account for the above observations, we propose a model in which when the Sp1 level is low, ets out competes Sp1 for binding to the EBS and synergistically enhances the hFR-gamma promoter activity by interacting with Sp1 bound at the canonical site whereas at higher levels, Sp1 represses the promoter by competitively inhibiting the binding of ets. As a partial extension of this model to the regulation of other ets activated genes, we show that Sp1 can predictably bind to a variety of ets elements including those responsive to Ets1 and Spi.1/Pu.1. A dual concentration-dependent action of Sp1 as an activator or a repressor offers a potential mechanism contributing to tissue-specific regulation of ets-dependent genes by Sp1.","['Kelley, Karen M M', 'Wang, Huiquan', 'Ratnam, Manohar']","['Kelley KM', 'Wang H', 'Ratnam M']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical College of Ohio, 3035 Arlington Avenue, Toledo, OH 43614-5804, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*genetics', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Oligonucleotides/genetics/metabolism', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/28 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111903004451 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00445-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2003 Mar 27;307:87-97. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00445-1.,['R01CA80183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (ETS1 protein, human)', '0 (Ets1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-ets-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the MAPK pathway has been shown to involve DAB2 induction [Tseng et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Energy charge and ATP content decline very early during the treatment. Mitochondrial respiration is dramatically decreased while lactate production results not modified. DNA fragmentation progressively increases starting one hour following oligomycin removal, while loss of plasma membrane integrity occurs with a much slower time-course. Similar effects are also shown in differentiation-induced erythroleukemia cells exposed to H(2)O(2). In this case, evidence is provided for the involvement of (*)OH generated by iron-catalyzed reactions in the mechanism by which H(2)O(2) impairs energy charge and induces apoptosis. We hypothesize a possible role played by interference with mitochondrial bioenergy through inactivation of mitochondrial ATPsynthase in the apoptosis triggered by oxidative stress under conditions in which cells undergo an iron overload-like status, as occurs in differentiation-induced erythroleukemia cells. These results point to the impairment of mitochondrial ATP synthesis and of energy charge as common early events critical for the execution of apoptosis, independently by the stimuli used for its induction: the specific inhibitor of mitochondrial ATPsynthase or H(2)O(2) exposure combined with the iron-enhancing differentiating treatment.","['Comelli, Marina', 'Di Pancrazio, Francesca', 'Mavelli, Irene']","['Comelli M', 'Di Pancrazio F', 'Mavelli I']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of Udine, Italy. mcomelli@dstb.uniud.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Free Radic Biol Med,Free radical biology & medicine,8709159,IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Respiration/drug effects', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Heme/biosynthesis', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Lactic Acid/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Oligomycins/pharmacology', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Time Factors']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2004/07/29 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0891584903001072 [pii]', '10.1016/s0891-5849(03)00107-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Free Radic Biol Med. 2003 May 1;34(9):1190-9. doi: 10.1016/s0891-5849(03)00107-2.,,"['0 (Oligomycins)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 3.6.3.- (Mitochondrial Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall survival at 5 years was 74.1% standard error (S.E.) 2.0%). It increased from 58.6% (S.E. 4.9%) for cases diagnosed in March 1979-July 1982 to 87.3 (S.E. 3.6) in May 1995-December 1998.

To analyze the function of the linker region, we have examined the effects of three Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) capsid linker mutations/variations in vivo, in the context of the full-length M-MuLV structural precursor protein (PrGag). Two mutations, A1SP and A5SP, respectively, inserted three and seven additional codons within the linker region to test the effects of increased linker lengths. The third variant, HIV/Mo, represented a chimeric HIV-1/M-MuLV PrGag protein, fused at the linker region. When expressed in cells, the three variants reduced the efficiency of virus particle assembly, with PrGag proteins and particles accumulating at the cellular plasma membranes. Although PrGag recognition of viral RNA was not impaired, the capsid linker variant particles were abnormal, with decreased stabilities, anomalous densities, and aberrant multiple lobed and tubular morphologies. Additionally, rather than crosslinking as PrGag dimers, particle-associated A1SP, A5SP, and HIV/Mo proteins showed an increased propensity to crosslink as trimers. Our results suggest that a wild-type retrovirus capsid linker region is required for the proper alignment of capsid protein domains.","['Arvidson, Brian', 'Seeds, Joshua', 'Webb, Mike', 'Finlay, Liam', 'Barklis, Eric']","['Arvidson B', 'Seeds J', 'Webb M', 'Finlay L', 'Barklis E']","['Vollum Institute and Department of Microbiology, Oregon Health and Sciences University, 3181 SW Sam Jackson Park Road, Portland, OR 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Capsid/*chemistry', 'Capsid Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Codon', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Genetic Variation', 'HIV-1/chemistry/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Protein Precursors/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/10 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202001423 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00142-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Mar 30;308(1):166-77. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00142-3.,"['GM52914-07/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM60170-03/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Capsid Proteins)', '0 (Codon)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Protein Precursors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results show that amphotropic mouse retroviruses (MLV-A) derived from human and hamster cells exhibit 2- to 3-fold higher half-lives compared to retroviruses from mouse cells. Cultivation at 32 degrees C has been reported to yield high virus titers. However, the benefit of virus production in mouse cells at 32 degrees C is controversial. In our hands the cultivation temperature affected, hitherto not noticed, the half-life time of MLV-A. The 37/32 degrees C shift resulted in a 3-fold decrease of viral half-lifes compared to MLV-A released from mouse cells at 37 degrees C. Thus, MLV-A released at 37 degrees C is phenotypically different from MLV-A synthesized at 32 degrees C. Increased virus stability was inversely correlated with the level of cholesterol in the viral membrane. Finally, depletion of viral cholesterol in vitro resulted in intact virus with increased thermal stability. Thus, retrovirus lability depends on the host cell and parallels the cholesterol amount in the viral lipid shell.","['Beer, Christiane', 'Meyer, Anika', 'Muller, Katja', 'Wirth, Manfred']","['Beer C', 'Meyer A', 'Muller K', 'Wirth M']","['Molecular Biotechnology, GBF, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/*physiology', 'Cholesterol/*analysis', 'Cricetinae', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Species Specificity', '*Temperature', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Virus Cultivation', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/10 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202000879 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00087-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Mar 30;308(1):137-46. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00087-9.,,"['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peptides with similar sequence motifs often provide membrane anchors, protein-protein interaction domains, or intracellular transport-targeting signals. Deleting most of the cytoplasmic N-terminal sequence of mCAT1 led to reduced expression on the cell surface and accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum but did not abrogate receptor function. Surprisingly, when the N-terminal 36 or 18 amino acids of mCAT1 were fused to green fluorescent protein (gfp), gfp accumulated almost exclusively in mitochondria. Mitochondrial targeting depended on arginines at positions 15 and 16 and was inhibitable by downstream transmembrane sequences. Although the full-length mCAT1 was not detected in mitochondria, the mitochondrial-targeting property of the N-terminal sequence fused to gfp is conserved in orthologous and paralogous proteins that diverged approximately 80 million years ago, suggesting a conserved biological function. We propose that the conserved N-terminal motif of CAT proteins provides a regulatable signal for transport to, or retention in, different cell membrane compartments.","['Ou, Wu', 'Silver, Jonathan']","['Ou W', 'Silver J']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Arginine', 'Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Luminescent Proteins/chemistry', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Protein Sorting Signals', 'Protein Transport', 'Receptors, Virus/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences/*physiology']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/10 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202000867 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00086-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Mar 30;308(1):101-13. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00086-7.,,"['0 (Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc7a1 protein, mouse)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after its discovery in 1980, human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was found to be the etiologic agent of both adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), a neurologic disease characterized by demyelinating lesions in both the brain and the spinal cord. Approximately 5-10% of HTLV-I-infected individuals develop either ATL or HAM/TSP. Interestingly, the two diseases have vastly different pathologies and have rarely been found to occur within the same individual. While a number of host and viral factors including virus strain, viral load, and HLA haplotype have been hypothesized to influence disease outcome associated with HTLV-I infection, the relative contributions of such factors to disease pathogenesis have not been fully established. Recent research has suggested that the route of primary viral infection may dictate the course of disease pathogenesis associated with HTLV-I infection. Specifically, mucosal exposure to HTLV-I has been associated with cases of ATL, while primary viral infection based in the peripheral blood has been correlated with progression to HAM/TSP. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating disease progression resulting from primary viral invasion remain to be elucidated. Although a variety of factors likely influence these mechanisms, the differential immune response mounted by the host against the incoming virus initiated in either the peripheral blood or the mucosal compartments likely plays a key role in determining the outcome of HTLV-I infection. It has been proposed that the route of infection and size of the initial viral inoculum allows HTLV-I to infect different target cell populations, in turn influencing the breadth of the immune response mounted against HTLV-I and affecting disease pathogenesis. A model of HTLV-I-induced disease progression is presented, integrating information regarding the role of several host and viral factors in the genesis of both neoplasia and neurologic disease induced following HTLV-I infection, focusing specifically on differential viral invasion into the bone marrow (BM) and the influence of this event on the virus-specific CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response that is initiated following HTLV-I infection.","['Barmak, Kate', 'Harhaj, Edward', 'Grant, Christian', 'Alefantis, Timothy', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Barmak K', 'Harhaj E', 'Grant C', 'Alefantis T', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/immunology/pathology/*virology']",101,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/06/10 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202000910 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00091-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Mar 30;308(1):1-12. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00091-0.,['CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we have investigated whether interleukin (IL)-6 may also be one of these factors. Following the induction of liver injury with acetaminophen (APAP), a time-dependent increase in liver mRNA expression of IL-6 and its family members IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M was observed in wild type (WT) mice, suggesting a possible hepatoprotective role played by this cytokine family. Indeed, mice lacking IL-6 (IL-6-/-) were more susceptible than were WT mice to APAP-induced liver injury. The increased susceptibility of the IL-6-/- mice was associated with a deficiency in the expression of hepatic heat shock protein (HSP)25, 32, and 40 as well as inducible HSP70 following APAP treatment. These results suggest that IL-6 and possibly other family members may protect the liver from injury, at least in part, by up-regulating the hepatic expression of several cytoprotective HSPs.","['Masubuchi, Yasuhiro', 'Bourdi, Mohammed', 'Reilly, Timothy P', 'Graf, Mary Louise M', 'George, John W', 'Pohl, Lance R']","['Masubuchi Y', 'Bourdi M', 'Reilly TP', 'Graf ML', 'George JW', 'Pohl LR']","['Molecular and Cellular Toxicology Section, Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, DHHS, Building 10, Room 8N110, Bethesda, MD 20892-1760, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Acetaminophen', 'Animals', '*Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury', 'Cytoprotection', 'Gene Expression', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*metabolism', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Liver/*metabolism', 'Liver Diseases/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03005722 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00572-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Apr 25;304(1):207-12. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00572-2.,,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '362O9ITL9D (Acetaminophen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study group comprised 44 children treated for ALL in the Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences in Poznan, in the years 1999-2001. Bone marrow smears were obtained by needle biopsy. Expression of SP was examined by immunocytochemistry with specific antibody against human SP and by in situ hybridisation with anti-mRNA 5'-biotinylated probe. The results of the study demonstrated that SP could be detected in the cytoplasm of lymphoblasts (mean percentage of 81.8% for immunocytochemical and 84.5% for in situ hybridisation technique) in leukaemias of the common and T-cell types. SP was absent from blasts in B-cell leukaemia and from normal haematopoietic, cells in children of the control group. The results show that lymphoblasts of common and T-cell origin acquire the capability to synthesise SP after their neoplastic transformation in childhood acute leukaemia. SP may be involved in auto- and paracrine mechanisms capable of inducing hyperplasia of the neoplastic cells.","['Nowicki, Michal', 'Miskowiak, Bogdan', 'Ostalska-Nowicka, Danuta']","['Nowicki M', 'Miskowiak B', 'Ostalska-Nowicka D']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Institute of Paediatrics, Karol Marcinkowski University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland. mapar@am.poznan.pl']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Folia Histochem Cytobiol,Folia histochemica et cytobiologica,8502651,IM,"['Adolescent', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', '*Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', '*In Situ Hybridization', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Substance P/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/metabolism']",,2003/04/23 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/04/23 05:00'],"['2003/04/23 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Folia Histochem Cytobiol. 2003;41(1):33-6.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '33507-63-0 (Substance P)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median intralaboratory coefficients of variation were 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, and 3.2% for CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19+ cell percentages, respectively. Interlaboratory variability was consistently lower than 6.5% for CD3+ and CD4+CD3+ cell percentages, and lower than 9.5% for CD8+CD3+ cell percentages. Median coefficients of variation for the absolute values were higher, ranging from 10.1% for CD4+CD3+ cells to 16.5% for CD19+ cells. The percentage of CD4+CD3+ and CD8+ CD3+ cells was in several samples significantly lower than the percentage of total CD4+ and CD8+ cells.

The major target for infection is the B lymphocyte, and acute infection causes vigorous EBV-specific killer T-cell responses exemplified clinically by acute infectious mononucleosis (IM). EBV infection usually persists latently life-long without eliciting any clinical symptoms. Rarely, active EBV infection is prolonged, with abnormal expansions of EBV-infected T or NK cells, conditions collectively defined here as EBV-associated T/NK lymphoproliferative diseases. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), chronic active EBV infection (CAEBV), NK lymphoma/leukemia, and T-cell lymphoma are entities included in this category. Hypersensitivity to mosquito bite (HMB) represents a unique syndrome characterized by expansion of EBV-infected NK cells in the peripheral circulation and within the inflammatory skin lesions induced by mosquito bites. Target cell specificity, defects in host immune responses, and strain differences of EBV may account for ectopic EBV infections and for the unique clinical presentations characteristic of each illness.","['Yachie, Akihiro', 'Kanegane, Hirokazu', 'Kasahara, Yoshihito']","['Yachie A', 'Kanegane H', 'Kasahara Y']","['Department of Laboratory Sciences, School of Health Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/classification/*complications/etiology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/virology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/etiology/*virology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/virology']",80,2003/04/22 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/04/22 05:00'],"['2003/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50012 [doi]', 'S0037196302000148 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Apr;40(2):124-32. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50012.,,,,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium. Single-Exposure, Fourteen-Day, and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the single-exposure and 14-day inhalation studies, all rats and mice exposed to 19,000 ppm chloroethane survived. The animals were not exposed at lower concentrations. No clinical signs of toxicity were seen. In the 14-day studies, final mean body weights of exposed male rats and exposed mice were higher than those of controls. Mean body weights of exposed and control female rats were similar. In the 13-week studies, rats and mice were exposed to 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 19,000 ppm chloroethane. No compound-related deaths occurred in rats or mice. The final mean body weight of rats exposed to 19,000 ppm was 8% lower than that of controls for males and 4% lower for females. Final mean body weights of exposed mice were generally higher than those of controls. No compound-related clinical signs or gross or microscopic pathologic effects were seen in rats or mice. The liver weight to body weight ratios for male rats and female mice exposed to 19,000 ppm were greater than those for controls. Although no chemically related toxic effects were observed in the short-term studies, concerns about potential flammability and explosion led to the selection of 0 and 15,000 ppm as the exposure concentrations for rats and mice for the 2-year studies. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of exposed male rats were 4%-8% lower than those of controls after week 33. Mean body weights of exposed female rats were generally 5%-13% lower than those of controls throughout the study. Although survival of male rats and exposed female rats was low at the end of the studies (male: control, 16/50; exposed, 8/50; female: 31/50; 22/50), no statistically significant differences in survival were observed between exposed and control groups of either sex. Survival at week 90 for male rats was 37/50 (control) and 31/50 (exposed) and for females, 43/50 (control) and 33/50 (exposed). The high incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia may have contributed to the high mortality. Mean body weights of exposed male mice were up to 13% higher than those of controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of exposed and control female mice were generally similar throughout the study. The survival of the exposed groups of both male (after day 330) and female (after day 574) mice was significantly lower than that of controls (final survival-- male: 28/50; 11/50; female: 32/50; 2/50). The majority of exposed female mice died as a result of uterine carcinomas. Male mice, and particularly exposed mice, died early as a result of an ascending urinary tract infection. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Malignant astrocytomas of the brain were seen in three exposed female rats, and gliosis was observed in a fourth. The historical incidence of glial cell neoplasms in untreated control female F344/N rats is 23/1,969. The highest incidence observed in an untreated control group is 3/50. Trichoepitheliomas (1/50), sebaceous gland adenomas (1/50), basal cell carcinomas (3/50), and squamous cell carcinomas (2/50) of the skin were observed only in exposed male rats. Keratoacanthomas occurred in four control and two exposed male rats. Exposure of female mice to chloroethane caused a high incidence of uterine carcinomas of endometrial origin (control, 0/49; exposed, 43/50). One control female did have a uterine carcinoma, although it was not of endometrial origin. The tumors observed in 34 exposed females were highly malignant, invading the uterine myometrium and metastasizing to a wide variety of organs, primarily lung (23), ovary (2 a wide variety of organs, primarily lung (23), ovary (22), lymph nodes (18), kidney (8), adrenal gland (8), pancreas (7), mesentery (7), urinary bladder (7), spleen (5), and heart (4), and to a lesser extent, colon, stomach, gallbladder, small intestine, ureter, and liver. Two marginally increased incidences of other neoplasms were observed in exposed male and female mice. The incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas in exposed female mice was greater than that in controls (3/49; 7/48). One other exposed female had a hepatocellular adenoma. The incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms of the lung in exposed male mice was greater than that in controls (adenomas or carcinomas, combined: 5/50; 10/48). Genetic Toxicology: Chloroethane, tested within the closed environment of a desiccator, was mutagenic with and without exogenous metabolic activation in S. typhimuriumstrain TA1535; in strain TA100, a positive response was observed only with activation. No mutagenic activity was observed in S. typhimurium strain TA98 with or without metabolic activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2--year inhalation studies, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of chloroethane for male F344/N rats, as indicated by benign and malignant epithelial neoplasms of the skin. For female F344/N rats, there was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity, as indicated by three uncommon malignant astrocytomas of the brain in the exposed group. The study of male B6C3F1 mice was considered to be an inadequate study of carcinogenicity because of reduced survival in the exposed group. However, there was an increased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar neoplasms of the lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice, as indicated by carcinomas of the uterus. A marginally increased incidence of hepatocellular neoplasms was observed in the exposed group.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of p-chloroaniline (greater than 99% pure) were conducted by administering p-chloroaniline hydrochloride in water by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Vehicle controls were given deionized water by gavage. All doses were calculated as p-chloroaniline; the chemical was administered as the hydrochloride after dissolution in water containing molar equivalents of hydrochloric acid. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Hematologic parameters were measured at the end of the 13-week studies and at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months in the 2-year studies. Supplemental studies of the distribution and disposition of p-chloroaniline were conducted in male F344 rats. Sixteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 16-day studies, male and female rats and mice received 25, 50, 100, or 400 mg/kg of body weight. The vehicle controls received deionized water. All rats and mice that received 200 or 400 mg/kg died during the first 6 days of the studies. Some deaths occurred in each of the lower dose groups of mice. Splenic enlargement was observed at necropsy in rats administered 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg. Congestion of the spleen and hemosiderin deposition in the renal cortical tubular epithelial cells were observed at 100 mg/kg in male and female rats. Compound-related lesions in mice included hemosiderosis of the liver Kupffer cells and congestion of the spleen. In the 13-week studies, 10 rats of each sex were administered doses of 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg/kg. All male rats lived to the end of the 13-week studies. One of 10 female rats that received 80 mg/kg died from unknown causes. The final mean body weights of rats that received 80 mg/kg were 16% lower than that of vehicle controls for males and 4% lower for females. In the 13-week studies in mice, 10 animals of each sex were administered doses of 0, 7.5, 15, 30, 60, or 120 mg/kg. Deaths in mice were not related to p-chloroaniline hydrochloride administration. The final mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice were similar. In both rats and mice, no chemically related effects on organ weights were observed at necropsy, except for the spleen, which was enlarged as a function of increasing dose. Methemoglobin was increased in dosed groups and resulted in a secondary anemia, the severity of which was dose related. Compound-related lesions observed histologically, including pigmentation (hemosiderin) in the kidney, spleen, and liver and hematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, reflected the response to the hemolytic anemia and methemoglobinemia induced by p-chloroaniline hydrochloride. Based on these results, groups of 50 rats of each sex were administered 2, 6, or 18 mg/kg p-chloroaniline hydrochloride in water by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were administered 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg on the same schedule. Metabolism and Disposition Studies in Rats: The metabolism and disposition studies in F344/N rats showed that metabolic and excretory pathways were not saturated by p-chloroaniline administered orally at doses ranging from 0.3 to 30 mg/kg. p-Chloroaniline was rapidly metabolized and excreted primarily in urine with a half-life of approximately 2 hours. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of dosed rats were generally within 5% of those of vehicle controls throughout the studies. The survival of the low and mid dose groups of male rats and of the low and high dose groups of female rats was significantly greater than that of the vehicle controls (male: vehicle control, 18/49; low dose, 32/50; mid dose, 32/50; high dose, 21/50; female: 27/50; 39/50; 36/50; 37/50). The increased survival was attributed to the decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia. Mean body weights of high dose male and female mice were generally within 5% of those of vehiclwithin 5&percnt; of those of vehicle controls throughout the studies. The survival of the mid dose group of male mice was lower than that of the vehicle controls after week 99 (male: 43/50; 36/50; 29/50; 35/50; female: 39/50; 42/50; 44/50; 41/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Fibrosis of the spleen was increased in dosed male and high dose female rats (male: vehicle control, 3/49; low dose, 11/50; mid dose, 12/50; high dose, 41/50; female: 1/50; 2/50; 3/50; 42/50). Cellular infiltration of lipocytes (fatty metaplasia) was observed in the spleen at increased incidences in high dose rats (male: 0/49; 0/50; 0/50; 24/50; female: 0/50; 0/50; 0/50; 11/50). The incidence of uncommon sarcomas of the spleen in high dose male rats was significantly greater than that in the vehicle controls (fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, or hemangiosarcomas, combined: 0/49; 1/50; 3/50; 38/50). Many of these tumors metastasized to one or more sites. In female rats, one fibrosarcoma of the spleen was found in a mid dose animal, and one osteosarcoma of the spleen was found in a high dose animal. The historical incidence of splenic connective tissue sarcomas (all types) in water gavage vehicle controls is 1/298 (0.3&percnt;) for male rats and 0/297 for female rats. The historical incidence of hemangiosarcomas in water gavage controls is 0/300 for male rats and 1/297 (0.3&percnt;) for female rats. Adrenal medullary hyperplasia was observed at an increased incidence in high dose female rats (4/50; 4/50; 7/50; 24/50). Marginally increased incidences of pheochromocytomas were seen in high dose male (13/49; 14/48; 15/48; 26/49) and female (2/50; 3/50; 1/50; 6/50) rats. The historical incidence of pheochromocytomas in water gavage vehicle control male F344/N rats is 121/299 (40&percnt; &plusmn; 16&percnt;); the historical incidence in water gavage vehicle control female F344/N rats is 20/295 (7&percnt; &plusmn; 2&percnt;). The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in dosed male and female rats were lower than those in vehicle controls (male: 21/49; 3/50; 2/50; 3/50; female: 10/50; 2/50; 1/50; 1/50). The incidences of malignant lymphomas in dosed male and female mice were lower than those in vehicle controls (male: 10/50; 3/49; 9/50; 3/50; female: 19/50; 12/50; 5/50; 10/50). Hematologic and methemoglobin measurements were made on blood samples collected from 15 randomly selected male and female rats per dose group at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. In general, the high dose group at various intervals showed mild hemolytic anemia and dose-related increases in methemoglobin. In rats, compound-related nonneoplastic lesions were seen histopathologically in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver. These lesions included bone marrow hyperplasia, hepatic hemosiderosis, and splenic fibrosis and suggest compound-related effects on the hematopoietic system in general, the erythropoietic system specifically, and mesenchymal cells in the spleen. In male mice, the incidence of hemangiosarcomas of the liver or spleen in high dose male mice was greater than that in the vehicle controls (4/50; 4/49; 1/50; 10/50). The historical incidence of hemangiomas or hemangiosarcomas at all sites (combined) in water gavage vehicle control male B6C3F1 mice is 11/350 (3&percnt; &plusmn; 3&percnt;). The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas or carcinomas (combined) were increased in dosed male mice (11/50; 21/49; 20/50; 21/50), primarily due to increased incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (3/50; 7/49; 11/50; 17/50). Hepatocellular carcinomas metastasized to the lung in 1/50 vehicle control, 1/49 low dose, 2/50 mid dose, and 9/50 high dose male mice. The historical incidence ofhepatocellular neoplasms in water gavage vehicle controls is 106/347 (31 &plusmn; 6&percnt;). Genetic Toxicology: p-Chloroaniline was mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation; no increase in revertant colonies was observed in strains TA97, TA1535, or TA1537. p-Chloroaniline induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells with and without metabolic activation. In cultured CHO cells, treatment with p-chloroaniline produced significant increases in sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) both with and without metabolic activation (S9); chromosomal aberrations were significantly increased only in the presence of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of p-chloroaniline have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year water gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-chloroaniline hydrochloride for male F344/N rats, as indicated by increased incidences of uncommon sarcomas of the spleen. Pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland may also have been associated with chemical administration. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-chloroaniline hydrochloride for female F344/N rats, as indicated by the presence of uncommon sarcomas of the spleen in one mid and one high dose animal and the increased incidence of pheochromocytomas of the adrenal gland. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-chloroaniline hydrochloride for male B6C3F1 mice, as indicated by increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms and of hemangiosarcomas of the liver or spleen. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of p-chloroaniline hydrochloride for female B6C3F1 mice administered 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg by gavage for 2 years. The incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats and of malignant lymphomas in male and female mice were decreased by administration of p-chloroaniline hydrochloride. Compound-related splenic fibrosis was present in male and female rats.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by feeding diets containing 2,4-dichlorophenol (greater than 99% pure) for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex. Genetic toxicology tests were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse L5178Y lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 14-day studies, male and female rats and mice were given diets containing 2,4-dichlorophenol at concentrations up to 40,000 ppm. One high dose male mouse died before the end of the studies; no deaths occurred in any other group, and no compound-related lesions were seen at necropsy in rats or mice. In the 13-week studies, groups of 10 rats and 10 mice of each sex were fed diets containing 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 40,000 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenol. All rats lived to the end of the studies, whereas all mice that received 40,000 ppm died during the first 3 weeks of the studies. Final mean body weights of rats that received 20,000 or 40,000 ppm and of male mice that received 20,000 ppm were at least 10% lower than those of controls. Bone marrow atrophy in rats and necrosis and syncytial alteration (multinucleated hepatocytes) in the liver of male mice were compound-related effects. Two-year studies were conducted by feeding diets containing 0, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenol to groups of 50 male rats and 50 male and 50 female mice for 103 weeks. Groups of 50 female rats received diets containing 0, 2,500, or 5,000 ppm. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male and female rats, high dose male mice, and both dosed groups of female mice were generally lower than those of controls. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex (male rats: control, 33/50; low dose, 25/50; high dose, 32/50; female rats: 34/50; 43/50; 40/50; male mice: 33/50; 32/50; 31/50; female mice: 45/50; 40/50; 43/50). The average daily feed consumption by rats in the low dose and high dose groups was 94%-97% that by the controls. The estimated daily mean consumption of 2,4-dichlorophenol was 210 or 440 mg/kg for low dose or high dose male rats and 120 or 250 mg/kg for low dose or high dose female rats. The average daily feed consumption by mice in the low dose and high dose groups was 97% and 78% of that by the controls for males and 94% and 85% for females. The estimated daily mean consumption of 2,4-dichlorophenol was 800 or 1,300 mg/kg for low dose or high dose male mice and 430 or 820 mg/kg for low dose or high dose female mice. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: There were no compound-related increased incidences of neoplastic lesions in rats or mice. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was decreased in dosed male rats relative to that in controls (control, 31/50; low dose, 17/50; high dose, 17/50); the incidence of malignant lymphomas was decreased in high dose female mice (4/50) relative to that in controls (12/50). Syncytial alteration of hepatocytes was observed at increased incidences in dosed male mice (11/50; 33/49; 42/48). Genetic Toxicology: The mutagenic effect of 2,4-dichlorophenol in S. typhimurium strain TA1535 was considered to be equivocal only in the presence of hamster S9; 2,4-dichlorophenol produced no increases in revertant colonies in strains TA98, TA100, or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. 2,4-Dichlorophenol increased trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in the mouse L5178Y assay without metabolic activation; it was not tested with activation. In cultured CHO cells, 2,4-dichlorophenol did not induce chromosomal aberrations but did significantly increase the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) both in the presence and absence of S9. Audit: The data, documents, and pathology materials from the 2-year studies of 2,4-dichlorophenol have been auom the 2-year studies of 2,4-dichlorophenol have been audited. The audit findings show that the conduct of the studies is documented adequately and support the data and results given in this Technical Report. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male F344/N rats fed diets containing 5,000 or 10,000 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenol or for female F344/N rats fed diets containing 2,500 or 5,000 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenol. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for male or female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 5,000 or 10,000 ppm 2,4-dichlorophenol.

FMG expression constructs caused massive syncytia formation followed by cytotoxic cell death in glioma cell lines, and antitumor activity has been shown in glioma xenografts. FMG-induced fusion in glioma cells can involve heterologous cell lines including normal astrocytes and fibroblasts, therefore making targeting important. Here we report on the use of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) cleavable linkers to target cytotoxicity of FMGs against gliomas. Expression constructs were made expressing the hyperfusogenic version of the Gibbon Ape Leukemia Virus envelope glycoprotein (GALV) linked to a blocking ligand (the C-terminal extracellular domain of CD40 ligand) via either an MMP cleavable linker (GALV M40), a factor Xa protease cleavable linker (GALV X40), or a noncleavable linker (GALV N40). Unmodified GALV expressing constructs were used as positive controls. The glioma cell lines U87, U118, and U251 previously characterized by zymography and MMP-2 activity assay as high, medium, and low MMP expressors, respectively; normal human astrocytes and the MMP-poor cell line TE671 were transfected with the GALV, GALV N40, GALV X40, and GALV M40 constructs. In contrast to unmodified GALV constructs, transfection with GALV X40 and GALV N40 constructs blocked fusion and cytotoxic cell death. Fusion occurred, however, after transfection with constructs containing MMP cleavable linkers to an extent dependent on MMP expression in the specific cell line. Use of the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitors, 1,10-phenanthroline and N-hydroxy-piperazine-carboxamide completely abolished the ability of MMP constructs to induce fusion. In cell mixing experiments, mixing of MMP-poor cell lines transfected with GALV M40 constructs with the MMP overexpressing untransfected U87 glioma cells led to partial restoration of fusion. Use of U87 supernatant did result in a similar effect. Establishment of stable tranfectants expressing the membrane-type MMPs, MT-1 MMP and MT-2 MMP did restore fusion in the MMP-poor cell line TE671 after transfection with GALV M40, thus indicating that both membrane-type MMPs and soluble MMPs activate the MMP cleavable constructs. In addition, the GALV M40 construct retained its cytotoxic activity against U87 cells in vivo, although less effectively as compared to unmodified GALV. Our data indicate that GALV-induced cytotoxicity in glioma cell lines can be blocked by display of the CD40 ligand. Incorporation of an MMP cleavable linker can selectively restore cytotoxicity in MMP expressing glioma cell lines both in vitro and in vivo, while sparing normal human astrocytes. Given the high frequency of MMP overexpression in gliomas, this represents a promising targeting strategy.","['Johnson, K J', 'Peng, K-W', 'Allen, C', 'Russell, S J', 'Galanis, E']","['Johnson KJ', 'Peng KW', 'Allen C', 'Russell SJ', 'Galanis E']","['Molecular Medicine Program, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Animals', 'Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Cell Death', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Glioma/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/*genetics', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'Phenanthrolines/pharmacology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Transfection/methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",,2003/04/22 05:00,2003/07/17 05:00,['2003/04/22 05:00'],"['2003/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.gt.3301951 [doi]', '3301951 [pii]']",ppublish,Gene Ther. 2003 May;10(9):725-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301951.,['CA 84388-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Matrix Metalloproteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (N-hydroxy-piperazine-carboxamide)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Discriminating genes included those involved in apoptosis, mismatch repair, cell cycle control and stress response. Only 14% of genes that changed when these medications were given as single agents also changed when they were given together.

At the onset of erythroid differentiation, truncated SCL protein isoforms arise by alternative translation initiation and favor the erythroid lineage.

BCRP is a 655-amino acid, 72.6 kDa protein, localized in the plasma membrane. As a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of drug transporters, BCRP has only one ATP-binding cassette and six putative transmembrane domains, suggesting that BCRP is a half-transporter, which may function as a homodimer or heterodimer. The BCRP-overexpressing tumor cells are resistant to mitoxantrone, adriamycin, daunorubicin, etoposide, topotecan and irinotecan, but lack resistance to paclitaxel and vincristine. Fumitremorgin C and GF120918 can effectively reverse multidrug resistance in BCRP-overexpressing tumor cells, associated with an increase in drug accumulation. In normal human tissues, low to high expressions of BCRP in placental syncytiotrophoblasts, in the epithelium of the small intestine and colon, in the liver canalicular membrane, in ducts of the breast, in endothelium of the blood vessel and in stem cells were reported. This expression profile allows speculation on a role of BCRP in protection of the fetus and in the regulation of transport of chemicals through the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract.

Among 16 cases without bone marrow morphologic involvement,3 cases (18.8%) were found with clonal TCRVgammaI-Jgamma gene rearrangement. These 3 cases presented bone marrow morphologic involvement 4-9 months later. Clonal TCRVgammaI-Jgamma gene rearrangement were detected in 85.2%(23/27) cases with bone marrow morphologic involvement. Among 26 cases with clonal TCRVgammaI-Jgamma gene rearrangement, 7 cases (26.9%) was found with oligoclonal/subclonal rearrangement after PCR-SSCP analysis. Of 7 cases with oligoclonal/subclonal rearrangement, 5 (71.4%) developed to leukemia 3-11 months later. The number of NHL patients with oligoclonal/subclonal rearrangement developed to leukemia was significantly higher than that (10.5%) of NHL patients without oligoclonal/subclonal rearrangement (P< 0.005) within 1 year. CONCLUSION: The detection of clonal TCRVgammaI-Jgamma gene rearrangement by PCR methods can be used to find bone marrow minimal disease in NHL patients without morphologic abnormality. NHL patients with oligoclonal/subclonal rearrangement are more likely to develop to leukemia; it can also develop to acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Further investigation was needed in this respect.","['Xu, Bing', 'Tian, Hong', 'Zhou, Shu-Yun']","['Xu B', 'Tian H', 'Zhou SY']","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, The First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, PR China. xbzj@fimmu.edu.com']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Prognosis']",,2003/04/22 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/04/22 05:00'],"['2003/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2003040397 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2003 Apr;22(4):397-400.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism of 8-Cl-Ado is now unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of 8-Cl-Ado on the activity of transcription factor cAMP-response-element-binding protein(CREB) and its correlative mechanism in human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. METHODS: MTT method was used to determine IC(50) (the concentration showing 50% of inhibition rate) of 8-Cl-Ado to HL-60. The protein levels and phosphorylated levels of CREB at different time following 8-Cl-Ado stimulation were examined using Western blot analysis. Gel shift assay was performed to examine DNA binding levels of CREB at different time following 8-Cl-Ado stimulation. RESULTS: (1)The IC(50) of 8-Cl-Ado to HL-60 was about 0.42 micromol/L. (2)8-Cl-Ado increased phosphorylated level of CREB rapidly, which was maximal at 30 minutes, and returned to basal level in 6 hours. The protein level of CREB was constant during 8-Cl-Ado stimulation. (3)8-Cl-Ado did not influence binding level of DNA and CREB. CONCLUSION: The increase of transcriptional activity of CREB induced by 8-Cl-Ado depends on the increased level of phosphorylated CREB, but is not associated with the protein level and DNA binging level of CREB.","['Chang, Xiao-Yan', 'Fang, Jia-Chun', 'Wang, Nai-Qin', 'Liu, Tong', 'Su, Hong']","['Chang XY', 'Fang JC', 'Wang NQ', 'Liu T', 'Su H']","['Department of Cell Biology, Beijing Institute for Cancer Research,School of Oncology, Peking University, Beijing, PRChina. changxiaoyan2002@yahoo.com.cn']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Ai Zheng,Ai zheng = Aizheng = Chinese journal of cancer,9424852,IM,"['2-Chloroadenosine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/drug effects/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",,2003/04/22 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/04/22 05:00'],"['2003/04/22 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/22 05:00 [entrez]']",['1000467X2003040350 [pii]'],ppublish,Ai Zheng. 2003 Apr;22(4):350-3.,,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '146-77-0 (2-Chloroadenosine)', 'PA05MFH3I7 (8-chloroadenosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the induction of mouse ES cell differentiation, using culture of embryoid bodies (EBs) into the diverse tissues. EBs were formed by culturing ES cells (129/SV strain) in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, in the absence of feeder cells and leukemia inhibitory factor (LF). EBs were induced to differentiate by treatment with retinoic acid (RA). In control medium (non-RA medium) beating muscles, blood vessels, hemocytes, and cartilages were frequently observed in EBs. Moreover, when EBs were cultured in medium including RA (5 x 10(-8) M, and 5 x 10(-9) M), differentiation of the optic vesicle, lens, retina, and neural groove was observed.

All cell lines were derived from bone marrow specimens, BALM 19-23 from a sample taken at diagnosisand BALM-26 from one at relapse. Like the original leukemia cells, the established lines present various B-cell characteristics, being positive for cell surface immunoglobulin (Ig) chains but also for nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase; hence the cell lines should be assigned to B-cell category B-IV. As a unique feature, the cell lines expressed the CD33 myeloid antigen in addition to the common B-cell markers. Heterogeneous antigen expression among the different cell lines was found regarding CD35, CD39, CD45RA, CD78 and CD95. The malignant nature of the cell lines was documented by negativity for the Epstein-Barr virus and by the occurrence of clonal non-random structural chromosome abnormalities. The patient's serum showed hypercalcemia, prompting further investigation of the established cell lines which expressed parathyroid hormone related peptide (PTHrP) mRNA as examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The established B-cell ALL sister cell lines, BALM 19-23 and BALM-26, could provide useful material for clarifying the pathogenesis of this type of B-cell malignancy.

Patient preparation for radioiodine-131 administration must be rigorous and is based on the stimulation of endogenous TSH production, which requires a hypothyroid state after withdrawal of suppressive T4-therapy. The introduction of recombinant human TSH would simplify the protocol of preparation and improve the quality of life of patients. The diagnosis place of radioiodine-131 knew significant changes following the introduction of the serum thyroglobulin measurement. This tumour marker has a central role in the strategy of follow-up and tends to be the principal element of indication for a diagnosis exploration with radioidine-131. The systematic ablation of thyroid remnants remains controversial particularly in patients with good prognosis factors; the efficacy of low activities is also still debatable. The optimal follow-up strategy and the indication of remnant ablation must take in account the prognosis factors of survival and recurrence. Radioiodine-131 therapy permits frequently the cure of distant metastases, particularly in infraradiological pulmonary forms. This fact outlines the importance of an early detection of tumour recurrence based on the conjunction of radioiodine-131 and thyroglobulin.

As(2)O(3) (iAs(III)) is methylated in the liver to mono- and dimethylated metabolites, including methylarsonic acid, methylarsonous acid, dimethylarsinic acid, and dimethylarsinous acid. Methylated trivalent metabolites that are potent cytotoxins, genotoxins, and enzyme inhibitors may contribute to the in vivo therapeutic effect of iAs(III). Therefore, we compared the potency of iAs(III) and trivalent metabolites using chemical precursors of methylarsonous acid and dimethylarsinous acid to induce differentiation, growth inhibition, and apoptosis. Methylarsine oxide (MAs(III)O) and to a lesser extent iododimethylarsine were more potent growth inhibitors and apoptotic inducers than iAs(III) in NB4 cells, an APL cell line. This was also observed in K562 human leukemia, lymphoma cell lines, and in primary culture of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not human bone marrow progenitor cells. Apoptosis was associated with greater hydrogen peroxide accumulation and inhibition of glutathione peroxidase activity. MAs(III)O, in contrast to iAs(III), did not induce PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha degradation, or restore PML nuclear bodies or differentiation in NB4 cells. In a cocultivation experiment, hepatoma-derived HepG2 cells, but not NB4 cells, methylate radiolabeled iAs(III). Methylated metabolites released from HepG2 cells are preferentially accumulated by NB4 cells. This experimental model suggests that in vivo hepatic methylation of iAs(III) may contribute to As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis but not differentiation of APL cells. MAs(III)O as an apoptotic inducer should be considered in the treatment of other hematologic malignancies like lymphoma.","['Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Zhou, Li', 'Styblo, Miroslav', 'Walton, Felecia', 'Jing, Yongkui', 'Weinberg, Rona', 'Chen, Zhu', 'Waxman, Samuel']","['Chen GQ', 'Zhou L', 'Styblo M', 'Walton F', 'Jing Y', 'Weinberg R', 'Chen Z', 'Waxman S']","['Department of Pathophysiology, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Oxides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Apr 15;63(8):1853-9.,"['5R01CA85478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56350/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES09941/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '593-58-8 (methylarsine oxide)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Exposure of U937 monocytic leukemia cells to minimally toxic concentrations of flavopiridol (FP), roscovitine, or CGP74514A for 3 h in conjunction with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (abbreviated LY in the article) resulted in a marked decrease in Akt phosphorylation. Coexposure of cells to LY and CDK inhibitors also resulted in an early (i.e., within 3 h) and striking increase in mitochondrial damage [e.g., cytochrome c, second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP)-binding protein with low isoelectric point (Smac/DIABLO), and apoptosis-initiating factor (AIF) release], caspase activation, and apoptosis. Similar interactions were observed in a variety of other leukemia cell types (e.g., HL-60, Jurkat, Raji, and NB4). Apoptosis, induced by FP/LY, was substantially blocked by ectopic expression of Bcl-2, but to a considerably lesser extent by dominant-negative caspase-8. FP-induced apoptosis was not enhanced by agents that inhibited protein kinase (PK) A (H89), PKC (GFX), mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK1/2; U0126), p38 MAP kinase (MAPK; SB202190), m-target of rapamycin (TOR; rapamycin), or ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM; caffeine), whereas the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin exerted effects similar to those of LY. The dramatic potentiation of CDK inhibitor-induced apoptosis by LY was accompanied by diminished Bad phosphorylation, induction of Bcl-2 cleavage, and down-regulation of X-linked IAP (XIAP) and Mcl-1. Cells exposed to CDK inhibitors + LY also exhibited reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3, forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), p70(S6K), and ERK, but increased activation of p34(cdc2) and p38 MAPK. LY/CDK inhibitor-treated cells also displayed diminished pRb dephosphorylation on CDK2- and CDK4-specific sites, retinoblastoma protein cleavage, and down-regulation of cyclin D(1). Inducible expression of constitutively active (myristolated) Akt significantly, albeit partially, attenuated apoptosis in Jurkat leukemia cells treated with either FP alone or the combination of FP and LY. Finally, cotreatment with LY and FP resulted in a dramatic increase in apoptosis in primary leukemic blasts obtained from a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Together, these findings suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays a major role in regulating the apoptotic response of human leukemia cells to pharmacological CDK inhibitors and raise the possibility that combined interruption of CDK- and PI3K-related pathways may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in hematological malignancies.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Rahmani, Mohamed', 'Dai, Yun', 'Conrad, Daniel', 'Krystal, Geoffrey', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Rahmani M', 'Dai Y', 'Conrad D', 'Krystal G', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['2-Aminopurine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Purines/pharmacology', 'Roscovitine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Apr 15;63(8):1822-33.,"['CA 63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93738/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (N(2)-(2-aminocyclohexyl)-N(6)-(3-chlorophenyl)-9-ethyl-9H-purine-2,6-diamine)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Purines)', '0ES1C2KQ94 (Roscovitine)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '452-06-2 (2-Aminopurine)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) is a major mechanism for the repair of DSBs. We previously reported that the cancer predisposition Bloom's syndrome and myeloid leukemias demonstrate increased NHEJ activity and consequent misrepair. In this study, we link this increased NHEJ activity and infidelity to ongoing or induced DNA damage at sites that recruit key NHEJ proteins. We show here that in myeloid leukemia cells and normal hemopoietic cells, agents that induce DSBs produce an up to 2-fold increase in this DSB misrepair activity, whereas an alkylating agent produces little or no increases. Furthermore, NHEJ overactivity after induction of DSBs is dependent on the presence of Ku70/Ku86. We also present data to explain the constitutively activated NHEJ in myeloid leukemias. Using an immunofluorescence-based assay for DNA damage, myeloid leukemias demonstrate constitutive DNA damage in the absence of treatment with DSB-inducing agents compared with normal hemopoietic cells. Importantly, damaged foci from myeloid leukemia and normal cells colocalize with NHEJ proteins Ku70 and Ku86. These data suggest that the generation of increased constitutive DNA damage may be a common pathway for the creation of NHEJ-dependent genomic instability.","['Brady, Nicola', 'Gaymes, Terry J', 'Cheung, Manyee', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Brady N', 'Gaymes TJ', 'Cheung M', 'Mufti GJ', 'Rassool FV']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemia Sciences Laboratories, The Rayne Institute, Guy's, King's, St. Thomas' School of Medicine, Denmark Hill, London SE5 9NU, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Nuclear/immunology/*metabolism', 'Aphidicolin/pharmacology', '*DNA Damage', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA Repair/*physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism/radiation effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Apr 15;63(8):1798-805.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed the clinical course and treatment outcome of 143 APL cases seen in four major hospitals in Hong Kong over a 10-year period. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was attained in 113 cases (79%) with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy. Relapse occurred at a median of 16 months in 54 cases, with a 3-year disease free survival of 56%. Post-relapse treatment was successful in 41 cases (76%), giving an actuarial 3-year overall survival (OS) of 81% from CR1. Three different protocols were used: chemotherapy alone (n = 19), allogeneic BMT (n = 14) and an As(2)O(3)-based regimen (n = 21). Chemotherapy was associated with the highest treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 53%, giving a CR2 rate of 47%. TRM was 36% for BMT. The CR2 rate for the As(2)O(3)-based regimen was 100%, with no TRM. However, 38% of As(2)O(3) treated patients had subsequent relapses, which were further salvaged in 75% by combined As(2)O(3) plus ATRA. The actuarial OS for the three protocols leveled off by 2 years at 82% for As(2)O(3), 43% for BMT and 23% for chemotherapy (P = 0.0004).

Conversely, data on the occurrence of second solid malignancies in this setting are scarce. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively evaluates the occurrence of second hematological and solid malignancies in the context of a prospective multicenter phase III trial comparing epirubicin-cyclophosphamide at intermediate doses (EC), or at full doses (HEC), with classical cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) in 777 patients with early breast cancer. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 73 months, the following 8-year actuarial rates of second solid primaries were observed: CMF 5.5% [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5% to 9.5%], EC 4.1% (95% CI 0.1% to 8.1%), and HEC 7.2% (95% CI 3.2% to 11.2%) (P = 0.79 by log rank test). Three secondary acute myeloid leukemias (AML) were reported, all in the HEC arm (incidence = 1.2%, 95% CI 0.0% to 2.5%), which by a three arm comparison allows us to conclude that HEC is statistically different (borderline significance) from CMF and EC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: HEC, as delivered in this trial, cannot be recommended in clinical practice because of the lack of superiority over classic CMF and because of the increased risk of AML observed in this arm. Prolongation of conventional anthracycline-based treatment beyond the current standard of four to six cycles is not recommended in clinical practice.","['Bernard-Marty, C', 'Mano, M', 'Paesmans, M', 'Accettura, C', 'Munoz-Bermeo, R', 'Richard, T', 'Kleiber, K', 'Cardoso, F', 'Lobelle, J P', 'Larsimont, D', 'Piccart, M J', 'Di Leo, A']","['Bernard-Marty C', 'Mano M', 'Paesmans M', 'Accettura C', 'Munoz-Bermeo R', 'Richard T', 'Kleiber K', 'Cardoso F', 'Lobelle JP', 'Larsimont D', 'Piccart MJ', 'Di Leo A']","['Jules Bordet Institute, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Belgium', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/secondary', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/diagnosis', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/chemically induced', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/09/25 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg204 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)63512-X [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 May;14(5):693-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg204.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,['Ann Oncol. 2003 May;14(5):663-5.

We hypothesized that constitutive activation of phosphatidyl-inositide 3 kinase (PI3 kinase) could regulate survival in primary cells from patients with AML. Here we demonstrate that Akt, a critical substrate of PI3 kinase, is activated in AML blasts. In a short-term culture system, most AML patient samples showed a dose-dependent decrease in survival after incubation with the PI3 kinase inhibitor LY294002. This decrease in survival was partially due to the induction of apoptosis. Furthermore, we have shown that p70 S6 kinase and 4EBP-1, downstream mediators of Akt signaling, also are phosphorylated in AML blasts. Phosphorylation of these proteins is inhibited by the mTOR inhibitor RAD001. Incubation of AML blasts with RAD001 induces only a small decrease in survival of the cells; however, when combined with Ara-C, RAD001 enhances the toxicity of Ara-C. These results demonstrate that constitutive activation of the PI3 kinase pathway is necessary for the survival of AML blasts and that targeting of this pathway with pharmacologic inhibitors may be of clinical benefit in treatment of AML.","['Xu, Qing', 'Simpson, Serge-Emile', 'Scialla, Timothy J', 'Bagg, Adam', 'Carroll, Martin']","['Xu Q', 'Simpson SE', 'Scialla TJ', 'Bagg A', 'Carroll M']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Pennsylnvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Everolimus', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3429 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50577-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):972-80. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3429.

Ten of the 23 mutation-positive and 11 of the 34 mutation-negative patients received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) in first complete remission (CR). In the mutation-positive group, the disease-free survival (DFS) for the allogeneic BMT recipients was 72% versus 23% for the 13 patients who received chemotherapy or autologous BMT (P =.01). DFS for the mutation-free patients with and without allogeneic BM transplantation was 55% and 40%, respectively (P =.38).

Implicated donors are usually multiparous women (>/=3 pregnancies). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Two fatal cases of TRALI were evaluated by reviewing clinical and laboratory findings and characterizing alloantibodies present in donor plasma. Investigation for WBC antibodies was by lymphocytotoxicity (LCT), FlowPRA (FlowPRA, One Lambda, Inc.) and granulocyte immunofluorescence and agglutination assays. Patient 1 was a 62-year-old man with chronic T-cell lymphocytic leukemia, and Patient 2 was a 54-year-old woman undergoing a cadaveric kidney transplant. Both patients developed acute respiratory distress and hypotension during (Patient 1) and approximately 30 minutes after (Patient 2) transfusion. Fulminant pulmonary edema ensued in both cases necessitating mechanical ventilation and both patients died within 24 hours of the onset of respiratory complications. RESULTS: The donors of the implicated blood components were women with a history of two pregnancies but no blood transfusions. Weak apparently panreactive granulocyte antibodies were detected with flow cytometry. However, in the granulocyte agglutination test, strong antibodies specific for human neutrophil antigen (HNA)-3a (5b) were identified in both donors. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that female blood donors with only two previous pregnancies can form clinically important granulocyte-reactive alloantibodies leading to fatal TRALI reactions in recipients. The sometimes devastating consequences of TRALI should prompt the development of strategies to prevent or reduce its incidence. Further research is warranted to investigate recipient and donor factors responsible for TRALI, including whether 5b (HNA-3a) alloantibodies are especially prone to cause severe reactions, and to better characterize the HNA-3a (5b) antigen, particularly at the molecular level.","['Davoren, A', 'Curtis, B R', 'Shulman, I A', 'Mohrbacher, A F', 'Bux, J', 'Kwiatkowska, B J', 'McFarland, J G', 'Aster, R H']","['Davoren A', 'Curtis BR', 'Shulman IA', 'Mohrbacher AF', 'Bux J', 'Kwiatkowska BJ', 'McFarland JG', 'Aster RH']","['Blood Center of Southeastern Wisconsin, PO Box 2178, Milwaukee, WI 53201-2178,USA.

The aim of this study was to identify factors that predict long-term hematopoietic reconstitution (LHR) following autologous BMT. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To identify predictors of LHR, peripheral blood counts and marrow biopsies were evaluated at 1 year after transplant in 81 patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) or chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent autologous BMT. Results were correlated with CD34+ cell dose, granulocyte-monocyte colony-forming units (CFU-GM) infused, and time to neutrophil engraftment (TNE). RESULTS: Total MNC dose, CD34+ cell dose, and CFU-GM infused were significantly associated with TNE (p = 0.011, p < 0.0001, and p = 0.078, respectively). Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia were more likely to have received a low CD34+ cell dose than patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (p = 0.01). Among the four principal predictors, only TNE showed consistent significant correlation with WBC, absolute neutrophil, and platelet count at 1 year after transplant. Logistic regression model showed that TNE was a more sensitive predictor of LHR than either CD34+ cell dose or CFU-GM infused. CONCLUSION: TNE is an in vivo functional measure of LHR and is a more sensitive predictor of LHR at 1 year after BMT than either CD34+ cell dose or CFU-GM infused.","['Zubair, Abba', 'Zahrieh, David', 'Daley, Heather', 'Schott, Daryls', 'Gribben, John G', 'Freedman, Arnold', 'Ritz, Jerome']","['Zubair A', 'Zahrieh D', 'Daley H', 'Schott D', 'Gribben JG', 'Freedman A', 'Ritz J']","[""Connell O'Reilly Cell Manipulation Core Facility and the Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*pathology', 'Postoperative Period', 'Regression Analysis', 'Time Factors']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/05/16 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']","['369 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00369.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2003 May;43(5):614-21. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00369.x.,"['5T32-HL66987/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL04095/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulmonary side effects have seldom been reported. The four patients we describe all developed respiratory disorders while being treated with IFN-alpha for hematological malignancies. We point out the similarities and differences noticed concerning the clinical course, pathological findings, and prognosis in the four different cases. Also, in addition to our review of the literature, we discuss the possible mechanisms involved in development of lung symptoms. In three patients the pulmonary disorder seems to have been caused by a cell-mediated immunological side effect in the form of interstitial pneumonitis. In one patient the symptoms were most likely caused by an autoimmunologic reaction, primarily engaging the vascular system, initially in the lungs. The single pathological finding existing in all four cases was the marked decrease in carbon monoxide diffusion capacity when performing spirometry. This was not necessarily associated with the existence of radiological findings. The decrease in diffusion capacity and the clinical symptoms were completely reversible in three of the patients, either spontaneously after the withdrawal of IFN-alpha or after treatment with corticosteroids. Our conclusion is that IFN-alpha, on rare occasions, can cause serious pulmonary side effects when used to treat both lympho- and myeloproliferative hematological malignancies. When pulmonary symptoms are evaluated during IFN-alpha therapy, spirometry, including estimation of carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, high-resolution computerized tomography, and ultracardiography should be used.","['Anderson, Patrik', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Rodjer, Stig']","['Anderson P', 'Hoglund M', 'Rodjer S']","['Hematology Section, Department of Medicine, Sahlgrenska University Hospital/Ostra, SE-416 85 Goteborg, Sweden. phacit@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmunity', 'Carbon Monoxide/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Interferon-alpha/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases/*chemically induced/diagnosis', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Spirometry']",,2003/04/18 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/04/18 05:00'],"['2003/04/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.10319 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2003 May;73(1):54-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.10319.,,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '7U1EE4V452 (Carbon Monoxide)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case report describes the very rare association of pentostatin-treated hairy cell leukemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Encouraged by first reports of promising activity of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in patients with autoimmune disorders, we decided to treat our patient with rituximab in the conventional dose of 375 mg/m(2) i.v. weekly for 4 cycles. One week after the first administration, the peripheral blood count has recovered with a normal platelet count. 22 weeks after completion of therapy, the patient is still in complete hematologic remission without further medication.

The clinicopathologic features of SM-AHNMD have not been fully characterized. We describe seven cases of this entity: 3 with MDS, 3 with AML, and 1 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In the majority of cases, SM was diagnosed concurrently with the myeloid malignancy and aberrant mast cell morphology was observed. The commonly described c-kit enzymatic site mutation Asp816Val was detected only in 2 cases, while 3 patients carried the Asp816His mutation. Among the 3 cases with AML, 2 patients carried the translocation t(8;21). On the basis of our results and other reported cases, there appears to be a specific association between SM and AML with t(8;21). Concurrent occurrence of SM may define a subset of patients with de novo AML and other myeloid malignancies who have an adverse prognosis.

To evaluate the characteristics of surgically excised cervical lymph nodes (LN) in children in a developing country, we studied 1,332 children less than 15 years old (1,877 surgically removed cervical LNs) over a 23-year period (1976-1999). Indications for biopsy included failure to respond to antibiotic therapy, rapid increase in size, hard, matted LNs in the preauricular, supraclavicular, and posterior triangle of the neck, and difficulty in diagnosis. Clinical and pathological characteristics investigated included age, malignancy, and granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis (tbc). The mean age was 7 years (tbc 5.8/neoplastic disease 8.5 years). Twenty LNs (1.5%) were histologically normal. There were 637 (47.8%) with nonspecific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia and 484 with chronic granulomatous changes (36.3%). Tuberculous lymphadenitis was confirmed in 332 of these (25%). In 181 (54.5%) Mycobacterium tuberculosis was cultured and a further 149 had acid-fast bacilli. Other granulomatous diseases identified included sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy (Rosai-Dorfmann disease) (3), syphilis (4), yaws (2), and toxoplasmosis (1). No mycobacteria other than M. tuberculosis were encountered. More than two-thirds (108) of 154 patients with neoplastic LN involvement had a lymphoma; in a further 10 lymphadenopathy was associated with leukemia. Pyogenic organisms were identified in 32, and 5 were positive for human immunodeficiency virus, 1 of whom had Kaposi's sarcoma. A second pathology was identified in 18 of the 637 cases of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (3 with tuberculosis); in 15 (1.3%) a diagnosis of lymphoma was made from other sites (pleural fluid, etc.) within 6 months of initial biopsy. This represents a diagnostically difficult subgroup requiring further investigation. Chronic lymphadenopathy in children in developing countries has a high incidence of infective causes, including a significant incidence of M. tuberculosis. The incidence of serious pathology in more than one-half of the cervical LNs examined justifies aggressive surgical investigation.","['Moore, S W', 'Schneider, J W', 'Schaaf, H S']","['Moore SW', 'Schneider JW', 'Schaaf HS']","['Department of Paediatric Surgery, University of Stellenbosch, Cape Town, South Africa. swm@sun.ac.za']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Pediatr Surg Int,Pediatric surgery international,8609169,IM,"['Biopsy, Needle', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphadenitis/diagnosis', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Male', 'South Africa']",,2003/04/18 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/04/18 05:00'],"['2001/10/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00383-002-0771-x [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Surg Int. 2003 Jun;19(4):240-4. doi: 10.1007/s00383-002-0771-x.

The effects of A3D8 on myeloid cells were associated with specific disruption of cell cycle events and induction of G0/G1 arrest. Induction of G0/G1 arrest was accompanied by an increase in the expression of p21, attenuation of pRb phosphorylation and associated with decreased Cdk2 and Cdk4 kinase activities. Since c-Jun is an important regulator of proliferation and cell cycle progression, we analysed its role in A3D8-mediated growth arrest. We observed that A3D8 treatment of AML patient blasts and HL60/U937 cells led to the downregulation of c-Jun expression at mRNA and protein level. Transient transfection studies showed the inhibition of c-jun promoter activity by A3D8, involving both AP-1 sites. Furthermore, A3D8 treatment caused a decrease in JNK protein expression and a decrease in the level of phosphorylated c-Jun. Ectopic overexpression of c-Jun in HL60 cells was able to induce proliferation and prevent the antiproliferative effects of A3D8. In summary, these data identify an important functional role of c-Jun in the induction of cell cycle arrest and proliferation arrest of myeloid leukemia cells because of the ligation of the cell surface adhesion receptor CD44 by anti-CD44 antibody. Moreover, targeting of G1 regulatory proteins and the resulting induction of G1 arrest by A3D8 may provide new insights into antiproliferative and differentiation therapy of AML.","['Zada, Abdul A Peer', 'Singh, Sheo M', 'Reddy, Venkateshwar A', 'Elsasser, Annika', 'Meisel, Alexander', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Tenen, Daniel G', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Behre, Gerhard']","['Zada AA', 'Singh SM', 'Reddy VA', 'Elsasser A', 'Meisel A', 'Haferlach T', 'Tenen DG', 'Hiddemann W', 'Behre G']","['Medicine III, University of Munich Hospital Grosshadern and GSF-Hematologikum, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', '*Genes, jun', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/immunology/*physiology', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun/biosynthesis/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'U937 Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",,2003/04/18 05:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/04/18 05:00'],"['2003/04/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206393 [doi]', '1206393 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Apr 17;22(15):2296-308. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206393.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aims of this study were to gain further insights into the nature of this activation and to assess its importance for the prolonged HC survival in this chronic disease. We show that HCs contain phosphorylated/activated p38 MAPK, JNK and ERK1/ERK2 (ERK1/2). PKC inhibitors increased the activation of p38 and JNK, but reduced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Moreover, PKC inhibition resulted in cell death; cell death was also observed when the activation of ERK1/2 in HCs was abrogated with an inhibitor of MEK1/2 activation. In addition to PKC, active Src kinase was also shown to be involved in the maintenance of Raf-independent ERK activation in HCs. During cell culture on a nonadherent surface, ERK phosphorylation was sustained, while phosphorylation of p38 and JNK decreased. This decrease was not observed in HCs cultured on vitronectin (VN), indicating that p38/JNK activation is probably a consequence of in vivo HC interaction with VN present in abundance in the red pulp of the spleen. Taken together, these results suggest that active p38/JNK make HCs susceptible to apoptosis, but the cells are effectively rescued by ERK activation involving constitutively active PKC and Src.

Amplitude-dependent speed of sound through the distal end of the first phalangeal diaphysis of the last four fingers of the hand was measured by an ultrasound device. In the majority of patients cortical area to total area ratio by metacarpal radiogrammetry (n = 120) and lumbar bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (n = 99) were also assessed. In patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets radial BMD by single-photon absorptiometry instead of lumbar BMD was measured. Mean values of amplitude-dependent speed of sound, cortical area to total area ratio, lumbar BMDarea, or lumbar BMD corrected for bone sizes estimated by a mathematical model (BMDvolume), as well as mean values of radial BMD in patients with X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, expressed as z score, were significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) in comparison with their reference values (-1.7 +/- 1.0, -2.0 +/- 0.9, -3.0 +/- 1.3, -1.9 +/- 1.0, -2.7 +/- 0.7, respectively). A positive relationship was found between amplitude-dependent speed of sound and cortical area to total area ratio (r = 0.90, p < 0.0001), lumbar BMDarea (r = 0.62, p < 0.0001), or lumbar BMDvolume (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). Fifty-two patients (38.5%) had suffered fractures in the 6 mo preceding the bone measurements, the radial distal metaphysis being the most frequent fracture site (28.8%). Mean values of amplitude-dependent speed of sound, cortical area to total area ratio, lumbar BMDarea, or lumbar BMDvolume, expressed as z score, of fractured patients were significantly lower (p < 0.0001) than those of fracture-free patients (-2.2 +/- 1.0 and -1.4 +/- 0.8, -2.6 +/- 0.9 and -1.7 +/- 0.7, -3.5 +/- 1.2 and -2.5 +/- 1.0, -2.5 +/- 1.0 and -1.3 +/- 0.7, respectively).

With the goal of identifying a prodrug that can target NO to the leukemia cells without inducing NO-mediated systemic hypotension, we have screened a series of O(2)-aryl diazeniumdiolates designed to be stable at physiological pH but to release NO upon reaction with glutathione. O(2)-(2,4-Dinitrophenyl) 1-[(4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl]diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate (JS-K) proved to be the most active antiproliferative agent among those tested in HL-60 cells, with an IC(50) of 0.2-0.5 microM. After 5 days of exposure to 0.5 micro M JS-K, HL-60 cells had differentiated and acquired some of the phenotypic features of normal monocytes. One- to 2-day treatment with JS-K at concentrations of 0.5-1 microM resulted in apoptosis induction in a concentration- and caspase-dependent manner. JS-K also inhibited the growth of solid tumor cell lines but to a lesser extent than HL-60 cells. JS-K was administered i.v. to nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient mice at doses of up to 4 micromol/kg without inducing significant hypotension. The growth of s.c. implanted HL-60 cells was reduced by approximately 50% when the mice received i.v. injections three times/week with 4 micromol/kg boluses of JS-K. Histological examination of tumor explants from JS-K-treated animals revealed extensive necrosis. Similar results were seen with s.c. human prostate cancer (PPC-1) xenografts. Our data indicate that JS-K is a promising lead compound for the possible development of a novel class of antineoplastic agents.","['Shami, Paul J', 'Saavedra, Joseph E', 'Wang, Lai Y', 'Bonifant, Challice L', 'Diwan, Bhalchandra A', 'Singh, Shivendra V', 'Gu, Yijun', 'Fox, Stephen D', 'Buzard, Gregory S', 'Citro, Michael L', 'Waterhouse, David J', 'Davies, Keith M', 'Ji, Xinhua', 'Keefer, Larry K']","['Shami PJ', 'Saavedra JE', 'Wang LY', 'Bonifant CL', 'Diwan BA', 'Singh SV', 'Gu Y', 'Fox SD', 'Buzard GS', 'Citro ML', 'Waterhouse DJ', 'Davies KM', 'Ji X', 'Keefer LK']","[""Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Utah and Salt Lake City Veterans' Administration Medical Centers, Salt Lake City, Utah 84148, USA. p.shami@m.cc.utsh.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Azo Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Glutathione Transferase/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Models, Chemical', 'Models, Molecular', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Donors', 'Phenotype', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Prodrugs/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/04/18 05:00,2004/02/10 05:00,['2003/04/18 05:00'],"['2003/04/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Apr;2(4):409-17.,"['ES09140/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Azo Compounds)', '0 (Nitric Oxide Donors)', '0 (O(2)-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)', '1-((4-ethoxycarbonyl)piperazin-1-yl)diazen-1-ium-1,2-diolate)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Prodrugs)', '0 (diazeniumdiolate)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting fusion of 5' E2A sequences with 3' portions of other genes leads to the expression of two well-characterized fusion proteins: E2A-PBX1 and E2A-HLF. Since the E2A, PBX1 and HLF proteins all appear to function as transcription factors, it appears likely that the oncogenic fusion proteins contribute to leukemia development by causing abnormal transcriptional regulation of key target genes. Furthermore, since the E2A portion of the fusion proteins contains transcriptional activation domains, and the PBX1 and HLF portions contain DNA binding domains, leukemogenesis may be due, at least in part, to excessive transcriptional induction of target genes defined by PBX1 or HLF. However, recent findings suggest that this model is simplistic and possibly incorrect.

After validating the technique, we used virtual Northern blots to analyze expression of NACA and ANX2 in progenitor cultures of nine children with JMML and five healthy individuals.

It is a systemic haematological malignancy that originates from B cells (B-CLL) in 95% of patients, while only a minority are derived through malignant transformation of T cells (T-CLL). Although B-CLL is classified as a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, several issues make this leukaemia a unique entity among malignant lymphoma. Inhibition of the programmed cell death (apoptosis) and upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 are key elements of the pathophysiology of B-CLL cells and define clinical prognosis. Furthermore, B-CLL cells are arrested in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Dysfunctional apoptosis and cell cycle are the main reasons for the clinical enigma, that CLL can not yet be cured with conventional chemotherapy. However, the molecular pathways that are responsible for this characteristic feature of the B-CLL cells still need further definition.Recently, considerable progress has been made in defining the molecular basis for the pathogenesis of CLL and in finding new therapeutic options. Recent studies indicate that B-CLL cells may be delineated from two main groups of normal B cells, i.e. pre- and postgerminal B cells, and can be distinguished through lack of or existence of mutations of the V heavy chain gene. This differential mutational status of the Ig V gene has significant impact on patient survival. Modern cytogenetic methods such as fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) have opened a new era in the molecular analysis of CLL cells. Determining the chromosomal aberration of the leukaemic cells has become a standard scientific programme for each clinical trial. The cytogenetic profile may soon help to define a clinical risk profile and guide the various treatment strategies. Further progress has been made in the therapy of CLL. Purine analogues such as fludarabine were able to induce significant improvement in remission rates; however, they did not lead to improved survival. Chimera of murine or rat monoclonal antibodies and human antibodies were designed to treat CLL. Antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), directed against CD20 and CD52, respectively, appear as attractive alternatives to conventional chemotherapy because of their lack of significant myelotoxicity. Studies using myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous or allogeneic stem cell transplantation were initiated with the hope of finding a cure for CLL. In contrast to autologous stem cell transplantation, allogeneic transplants appear to display a plateau of relapse rates. In conclusion, for many years CLL was considered as a chronic haematological malignancy that required only few diagnostic tools and for whom no hope of cure could be offered. The current review focuses on recent improvements in diagnosis and treatment of CLL that have opened a new era in the management of patients with this systemic malignancy.","['Schriever, Folke', 'Huhn, Dieter']","['Schriever F', 'Huhn D']","['Charite, Virchow-University Hospital, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany. folke.schriever@t-online.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",New Zealand,Drugs,Drugs,7600076,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Rituximab']",108,2003/04/18 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/18 05:00'],"['2003/04/18 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [entrez]']","['63103 [pii]', '10.2165/00003495-200363100-00003 [doi]']",ppublish,Drugs. 2003;63(10):953-69. doi: 10.2165/00003495-200363100-00003.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a gold complex that contains both types of phosphine ligands, thus suggesting a possible synergistic action. The results of a single crystal X-ray structure determination of this molecule show the metal surrounded by 3 P atoms and one Cl anion in a distorted tetrahedral arrangement. The chloro anion, however, is weakly bound to the metal and so the species shows ionic character. The P NMR study, performed in solution, confirms the structural features observed in the solid and, in addition, indicates partial formation of other known gold(I)-diphosphine antitumor agents. The ionic character and strong Au-P bonds of this novel gold(I) species are similar to those of the most active antitumor gold compounds so far studied. The former feature contributes to solubility in biological fluids, and the latter prevents fast biomolecular attack. In addition, the title compound is less lipophilic, a feature recently correlated to lower liver toxicity. The title compound shows in vitro antitumor activity in the two initial National Cancer Institute protocols against human tumors. In the first screening, a unique dose (0.10 mM) of the title compound reduced cell growth of MCF7 (breast cancer), NCI-H460 (lung cancer), and SF-268 (Central Nervous System cancer-CNS) to 5, 8, and 11%, respectively. In the second protocol a 60-cell line panel was analyzed with the title compound concentration in the 0.1 mM-0.01 microM range. The highest activity was for the breast tumor cell line MCF7 with a LC(50) less than 0.01 microM. LC(50) values in the micromolar range were obtained for 29 cell lines. With the exception of leukemia, these micromolar activities were observed in at least one cell line for each subgroup tumor (non small lung, colon, CNS, melanoma, renal, prostate, breast, and ovarian). The leukemia inactivity was unexpected, as all antitumor gold(I) phosphine compounds in the literature described thus far are active.

Possibility of more relevant prognosis has a great impact for the beginning and mode of therapy. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred patients diagnosed as having B-CLL were included into the study. Beside usual examinations necessary to establish the diagnosis, cytogenetic examination for the detection of deletion 13q14, 17p13, 11q23 and trisomy 12 and immunophenotyping was done. The mean age of the patients was 58.2 years, there were 62 men and 38 women. 91 evaluated patients were divided into two groups--those with the steady disease (55 pts) and those with progressive disease (36 pts). No relation between the number of cytogenetic abnormalities and the Rai stage of the disease was found. We identified a relation between the bone marrow infiltration pattern (diffuse) and the number of cytogenetic abnormalities and the del 13q14 (p.05). Using the immunophenotyping of the lymphocytes we found a relation between the expression of CD38 and CD11c and the disease progression (p < 0.05). Neither of the method (FISH and immunophenotyping) revealed differences between results from bone marrow samples and those from peripheral blood. CONCLUSIONS: Though the cytogenetic (FISH) and immunophenotype evaluation at the time of diagnosis did not improve the ability to define better the clinical course of the B-CLL, we suggest to use both methods routinely as an important tool to identify patients who would develop the progressive disease.","['Cmunt, E', 'Michalova, K', 'Karban, J', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Sindelarova, L', 'Bosakova, Z', 'Brezinova, J', 'Kurkova, S', 'Schwarz, J']","['Cmunt E', 'Michalova K', 'Karban J', 'Zemanova Z', 'Sindelarova L', 'Bosakova Z', 'Brezinova J', 'Kurkova S', 'Schwarz J']","['I. interni klinika 1.

METHODS: A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used to describe data from 23 children with ALL (aged 2-15 years). Prednisolone (60 mg/m(2) per day in three divided doses) was administered both orally and intravenously, and samples were obtained on several days during the initial 5 weeks of remission induction therapy. Unbound plasma concentrations ( n=288) were determined by HPLC and ultrafiltration. Nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (WinNonMix version 2.0.1) was used to estimate the pharmacokinetic parameters, to identify significant covariates, and to estimate the protein binding parameters. RESULTS: Prednisolone showed complete oral bioavailability. The median unbound clearance (32 l/h per m(2)) was lower, and the half-life (3.6 h) longer than previously reported in childhood ALL. Body weight was a significant covariate for the central and peripheral volumes of distribution resulting in interindividual variabilities of 50% and 42%. Including body surface area as a covariate for clearance decreased the interindividual variability to 14%. The estimated areas under the unbound plasma concentration-time curves showed less than twofold variation among patients, and a residual variability of 20% indicated that the pharmacokinetic parameters remained stable during induction therapy. The estimated protein binding parameters were comparable to, but slightly lower than, previously published values and independent of the albumin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed complete oral bioavailability, a lower unbound clearance and a longer half-life for prednisolone than previously reported in childhood ALL. Plasma protein binding was independent of the albumin concentration. Due to the small inter- and intraindividual variations in the pharmacokinetic parameters, body surface area-based dosing is sufficient to obtain similar systemic exposure among patients.","['Petersen, Kamilla B', 'Jusko, William J', 'Rasmussen, Mette', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld']","['Petersen KB', 'Jusko WJ', 'Rasmussen M', 'Schmiegelow K']","['Department of Pharmaceutics, The Danish University of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Body Surface Area', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Population', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Prednisolone/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Ultrafiltration']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2002/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2003/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0602-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Jun;51(6):465-73. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0602-3.

Isolated CsA-induced hyperkalemia occurring through different mechanisms is also common. However, there are only a few ""case reports"" addressing this phenomenon in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation patients. In this report, we propose mechanisms and methods of managing CsA-associated hyperkalemia in allogeneic transplantation. METHODS: We report on four allogeneic blood stem- cell transplant cases and a review of the literature. RESULTS: Four adult leukemia patients underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and received CsA as a part of their graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. The patients developed hyperkalemia, despite adequate kidney function. CsA seemed to be the only pharmaceutical agent to which this electrolyte abnormality could be attributed. Renal tubule dysfunction and secondary hypoaldosteronism seemed to be the reasons for CsA-associated hyperkalemia. CONCLUSION: This report of four cases demonstrates that CsA should be considered among the possible causes of hyperkalemia in bone marrow transplantation. There may be a need for urgent intervention depending on the severity of hyperkalemia. Monitoring of blood CsA level and dose adjustment are important for the prevention of this complication.","['Caliskan, Yasar', 'Kalayoglu-Besisik, Sevgi', 'Sargin, Deniz', 'Ecder, Tevfik']","['Caliskan Y', 'Kalayoglu-Besisik S', 'Sargin D', 'Ecder T']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Istanbul School of Medicine, CAPA 34 390, Istanbul, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adult', 'Cyclosporine/*adverse effects', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hyperkalemia/*chemically induced', 'Hypoaldosteronism/chemically induced', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', 'Kidney/physiopathology', 'Kidney Tubules/drug effects/physiopathology', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",22,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000057241.69355.59 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Apr 15;75(7):1069-72. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000057241.69355.59.,,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: An analysis was performed of serum samples from a multiorgan donor and the five recipients. Also studied was the donor's family and the partner of one of the renal recipients. Serologic detection of anti-HTLV antibodies was carried out by enzyme immunoassay and Western blot to confirm and discriminate between HTLV types. Analysis of proviral DNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in the long terminal repeat region and the env gene. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples from all the recipients of the HTLV-I-positive organs and the donor's mother were studied. RESULTS: Two years after transplantation, three organ recipients positive for antibodies to HTLV-I were detected (two kidney transplants and one liver). All the recipients' serum samples were negative at the time of transplantation except those from the multiorgan donor. The donor's mother was born in Venezuela and was confirmed positive for antibodies to HTLV-I. The remaining family members were negative. HTLV-I DNA sequences were recovered, amplified, and sequenced from all the samples from the HTLV-I-positive recipients and the donor's mother. The homology of HTLV-I sequences was 100% in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: The authors are reporting the first documented case of HTLV-I infection in several transplant recipients sharing the same donor. The donor was infected by vertical transmission. HTLV-I infection has devastating consequences for some immunocompromised organ recipients. This emphasizes the need for a systematic survey of HTLV antibodies in all potential donors.","['Gonzalez-Perez, M Paz', 'Munoz-Juarez, Lourdes', 'Cardenas, Francisca Cardenas', 'Zarranz Imirizaldu, Juan J', 'Carranceja, Jesus Corral', 'Garcia-Saiz, Alfredo']","['Gonzalez-Perez MP', 'Munoz-Juarez L', 'Cardenas FC', 'Zarranz Imirizaldu JJ', 'Carranceja JC', 'Garcia-Saiz A']","['Diagnostico y Referencia de Retrovirus, Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Ctra.

In this study, we describe a new, unusually large gene on chromosome 7p12.3, ABCA13. This gene spans over 450 kb and is split into 62 exons. The predicted ABCA13 protein consists of 5,058 ami- no acid residues making it the largest ABC protein described to date. Like the other ABCA subfamily members, ABCA13 contains a hydrophobic, predicted transmembrane segment at the N-terminus, followed by a large hydrophilic region. In the case of ABCA13, the hydrophilic region is unexpectedly large, more than 3,500 amino acids, encoded by 30 exons, two of which are 4.8 and 1.7 kb in length. These two large exons are adjacent to each other and are conserved in the mouse Abca13 gene. Tissue profiling of the major transcript reveals the highest expression in human trachea, testis, and bone marrow. The expression of the gene was also determined in 60 tumor cell lines and the highest expression was detected in the SR leukemia, SNB-19 CNS tumor and DU-145 prostate tumor cell lines. ABCA13 has high similarity with other ABCA subfamily genes which are associated with human inherited diseases: ABCA1 with the cholesterol transport disorders Tangier disease and familial hypoalphalipoproteinemia, and ABCA4 with several retinal degeneration disorders. The ABCA13 gene maps to chromosome 7p12.3, a region that contains an inherited disorder affecting the pancreas (Shwachman-Diamond syndrome) as well as a locus involved in T-cell tumor invasion and metastasis (INM7), and therefore is a positional candidate for these pathologies.","['Prades, C', 'Arnould, I', 'Annilo, T', 'Shulenin, S', 'Chen, Z Q', 'Orosco, L', 'Triunfol, M', 'Devaud, C', 'Maintoux-Larois, C', 'Lafargue, C', 'Lemoine, C', 'Denefle, P', 'Rosier, M', 'Dean, M']","['Prades C', 'Arnould I', 'Annilo T', 'Shulenin S', 'Chen ZQ', 'Orosco L', 'Triunfol M', 'Devaud C', 'Maintoux-Larois C', 'Lafargue C', 'Lemoine C', 'Denefle P', 'Rosier M', 'Dean M']","['Functional Genomics, Aventis Pharma SA, Vitry Sur Seine, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,IM,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/biosynthesis/*chemistry/*genetics', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary/isolation & purification', 'Exons', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2002/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000069852 [doi]', '69852 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2002;98(2-3):160-8. doi: 10.1159/000069852.,['N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (ABCA13 protein, human)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

However, they should also be suited to examine the validity and reliability of molecular cytogenetic techniques in detecting genomic alterations in neoplastic cells. Therefore, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and 24-color-fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (M-FISH) were applied to eight sublines of CCRF-CEM leukemia cells selected in vitro for drug resistance and to their drug-sensitive parental counterparts. All cell lines were characterized by altered chromosome numbers and by a variety of chromosomal structural aberrations as shown by M-FISH. The great majority of anomalies detected by this technique were confirmed by CGH. Interestingly, a considerable number of the rearrangements found were imbalanced. Amplifications of 5q13 in the six methotrexate-resistant cell lines, a del(9)(p21pter) in all lines examined, and a gain of chromosome 20 in 9 of the 10 lines examined were readily detected by both techniques. The same held true for losses of chromosomes 17 and 18 in the near tetraploid cell lines which could also be confirmed by CGH. Some imbalances of genomic material detected by CGH were, however, not observed by means of M-FISH, possibly due to the limited extension of the corresponding chromosomal segment involved or the small subpopulation of cells affected. On the other hand, reciprocal translocations, balanced isochromosomes, and small deletions remained mainly undetected by CGH. A comparison of chromosomal alterations in drug-resistant and parental cell lines showed not only amplifications of chromosomal segments harboring well-known drug resistance genes, e.g., the dihydrofolate reductase gene, but also chromosomal changes which may involve novel genes associated with drug resistance. Thus, the present study has clearly unveiled the strengths and weaknesses of both techniques which can excellently complement each other. Their combination allowed a distinct improvement of the definition of the complex karyotypes of drug-resistant cell lines.","['Weise, A', 'Liehr, T', 'Efferth, T', 'Kuechler, A', 'Gebhart, E']","['Weise A', 'Liehr T', 'Efferth T', 'Kuechler A', 'Gebhart E']","['Institute of Human Genetics and Anthropology, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cytogenet Genome Res,Cytogenetic and genome research,101142708,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/14 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2002/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000069808 [doi]', '69808 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytogenet Genome Res. 2002;98(2-3):118-25. doi: 10.1159/000069808.,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

The introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) doubled the survival of patients with this disease. However, despite ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, 12%-30% of patients will still relapse. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with first and subsequent relapsed or refractory APL, regardless of the disease-free interval. Treatment of relapsed and refractory patients with this novel therapy produces complete remission in 87% of patients and molecular remission in 83%. Studies have documented the efficacy of autologous and allogeneic transplantation as salvage therapy in relapsed and refractory APL. The introduction of ATO into the treatment regimen for APL has stimulated discussion on its role in the transplantation setting. Investigators recently met to discuss the issue and make recommendations regarding ATO therapy in patients who are in their second or subsequent complete remission and are candidates for transplantation. This article describes the pivotal studies of this novel agent, discusses risk factor stratification for relapse in patients with APL, and proposes protocols for treatment incorporating ATO therapy. In addition, it describes scientific issues in ongoing and proposed clinical trials of ATO therapy for this disease.","['Douer, Dan', 'Hu, Wendy', 'Giralt, Sergio', 'Lill, Michael', 'DiPersio, John']","['Douer D', 'Hu W', 'Giralt S', 'Lill M', 'DiPersio J']","['Division of Hematology, Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California at Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA. douer_d@mikey.hsc.usc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/standards/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/standards/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Europe', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/standards', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/epidemiology/*therapy', 'Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Oxides/standards/*therapeutic use', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Risk Factors', 'Tretinoin/standards/therapeutic use', 'United States/epidemiology']",47,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.8-2-132 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2003;8(2):132-40. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.8-2-132.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 287 children with HR-ALL were randomly assigned to intensive chemotherapy regimens (New York I [NY I] or NY II) as part of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG)-1901 protocol. The induction phases consisted of five drugs (vincristine, prednisone, l-asparaginase, daunorubicin, and cyclophosphamide). Initial consolidation comprised six-agent chemotherapy combined with 18 Gy of total-brain irradiation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive G-CSF (5 microg/kg/day) during either induction or initial consolidation. A crossover study analysis was done on the 259 patients who completed both phases of therapy. RESULTS: The mean time to neutrophil recovery (>/= 0.5 x 109/L) was reduced with G-CSF (16.7 v 19.1 days, P =.0003); however, patients who received G-CSF did not have significantly reduced episodes of febrile neutropenia (149 v 164, P =.41), positive blood cultures (57 v 61, P =.66), or serious infections (75 v 79, P =.62). Hospitalization (14.0 v 13.9 days, P =.87) and induction therapy completion times (NY I, 30.3 v 31.3 days, P =.11; NY II, 33.4 v 32.3 days, P =.40) were not significantly altered. There were no differences in 6-year EFS (P =.24) or OS (P =.54) between patients receiving or not receiving G-CSF on CCG-1901, NY I and NY II.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nineteen older patients (median age, 64 years; range, 60 to 70 years) with active myeloid malignancies were treated with an RIC regimen that was based on fludarabine, melphalan, and carmustine followed by alloHSCT from matched unrelated (n = 12) or sibling donors (n = 7). Before transplantation, patients had a median of 50% bone marrow blasts (range, 0% to 70%). Graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate. Eleven of 12 patients with an unrelated donor also received anti-T-lymphocyte globulin (ATG). RESULTS: Engraftment was successful for all 19 patients. Seventeen assessable patients achieved complete response (CR). Four patients experienced relapse; three achieved CR again after donor lymphocyte infusion (n = 1) or a second alloHSCT (n = 2). Six patients died as a result of relapse (n = 2), GvHD-associated complications (n = 2), or fungal infections (n = 2), resulting in a 1-year nonrelapse mortality rate of 22%. With a median follow-up of 825 days (range, 595 to 1,028 days), 13 of 19 patients are alive, resulting in a 1-year survival rate of 68% (95% confidence interval, 48% to 89%). CONCLUSION: In older patients with untreated poor-prognosis leukemia, this RIC regimen combined with alloHSCT sufficiently reduces the leukemic burden, resulting in a high CR rate. When ATG is added, matched unrelated donor transplantation can be performed safely in older patients. For these patients, early transplantation after diagnosis offers a fair chance of cure.","['Bertz, Hartmut', 'Potthoff, Karin', 'Finke, Jurgen']","['Bertz H', 'Potthoff K', 'Finke J']","['Albert Ludwigs University Medical Center, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Hugstetter Str 55, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany. finke@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*surgery', '*Living Donors', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Siblings', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.09.110 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.09.110 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 15;21(8):1480-4. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.09.110.,,"['FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although defective progenitor-stromal adhesion is a well-recognized feature of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the role of CDH13 abnormalities has not been evaluated in this disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the methylation status of the CDH13 promoter in 179 chronic phase (CP)-CML patients and in 52 advanced-phase samples and correlated it with mRNA expression using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcriptase PCR. RESULTS: Aberrant de novo methylation of the CDH13 promoter region was observed in 99 (55%) of 179 of CP-CML patients, and 90 of the patients failed to express CDH13 mRNA (P <.0001). Advanced-stage samples (n = 52) showed concordant methylation results with their corresponding CP tumors, indicating that CDH13 methylation was not acquired during the course of the disease. Nevertheless, absence of CDH13 expression was more frequently observed among Sokal high-risk patients (P =.01) and was also independently associated with a shorter median progression-free survival time (P =.03) and poor cytogenetic response to interferon alfa treatment (P =.0001). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that the silencing of CDH13 expression by aberrant promoter methylation occurs at an early stage in CML pathogenesis and probably influences the clinical behavior of the disease.","['Roman-Gomez, Jose', 'Castillejo, Juan A', 'Jimenez, Antonio', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Boque, Concepcion', 'Hermosin, Lourdes', 'Leon, Angel', 'Granena, Albert', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Heiniger, Anabel', 'Torres, Antonio']","['Roman-Gomez J', 'Castillejo JA', 'Jimenez A', 'Cervantes F', 'Boque C', 'Hermosin L', 'Leon A', 'Granena A', 'Colomer D', 'Heiniger A', 'Torres A']","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Avda, Menendez Pidal s/n, 14004 Cordoba, Spain. peperosa@teleline.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cadherins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', '*Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.08.166 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.08.166 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 15;21(8):1472-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.08.166.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cadherins)', '0 (H-cadherin)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2012 Apr 1;30(10):1148.

Here we examine pretreatment biologic features that promote resistance to apoptosis and CDC in CLL patients and correlate it with clinical outcome to rituximab-based therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pretreatment samples from 21 CLL patients treated on a prospective, single-agent rituximab trial were examined for quantitative expression of apoptotic and CDC regulatory proteins, and the level of expression of these proteins was correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Of the 21 patents for whom samples were available, 10 attained a partial response and 11 failed to respond to rituximab therapy. The mean pretreatment expression of Bcl-2, Mcl-1, XIAP, and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax were higher but not statistically increased in nonresponding patients versus those responding to treatment. In contrast, the pretreatment Mcl-1/Bax ratio was significantly elevated (0.82 +/- 0.28 v 0.39 +/- 0.29, P <.016) in nonresponding patients compared with patients responding to rituximab therapy. Although pretreatment expression of CD55 and CD59 was not associated with response to rituximab therapy, significantly higher levels of CD59 were observed in the CLL cells that were not cleared from the blood at completion of therapy than the level observed at baseline levels (P =.02). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that baseline expression of the Mcl-1/Bax ratio, but not CD55 and CD59, predict for clinical response to rituximab therapy in CLL patients. Further study of disrupted apoptosis in CLL as a potential mechanism of resistance to rituximab appears warranted.","['Bannerji, Rajat', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Flinn, Ian W', 'Pearson, Michael', 'Young, Donn', 'Reed, John C', 'Byrd, John C']","['Bannerji R', 'Kitada S', 'Flinn IW', 'Pearson M', 'Young D', 'Reed JC', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Starling Loving Hall, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. byrd-3@medctr.osu.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'CD55 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD59 Antigens/metabolism', '*Complement System Proteins/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*metabolism', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.06.012 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.06.012 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 15;21(8):1466-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.06.012.,"['CA98099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA81534-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P3016058/PHS HHS/United States']","['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On ML-2 and HL-60 cells, dimers and trimers generally show a lower activity than bovine seminal RNase; the activity of tetramers, instead, is similar to or higher than that of the seminal enzyme. The growth of human melanoma in nude mice is inhibited by RNase A oligomers in the order dimers < trimers < tetramers. The action of the two tetramers is very strong, blocking almost completely the growth of melanoma.

Thus, our ultimate goal is to develop protocols for gene therapy, which are suitable to humans on the earth as well as in space. Specifically, we are trying to cure the hemoglobinopathies, beta-thalassemia (Cooley's anemia) and sickle cell anemia, by gene therapy. These well-characterized molecular diseases serve as models for developing ex vivo gene therapy, which would apply to other disorders as well. For example, the procedure may become directly relevant to treating astronauts for space-anemia, immune suppression and bone marrow derived tumors, e.g. leukemia. The adeno-associated virus serotype 2 (AAV2) is a non-pathogenic human parvovirus with broad host-range and tissue specificity. Exploiting these characteristics we have been developing protocols for recombinant AAV2 (rAAV)-based gene therapy.

Furthermore, to evaluate the immune surveillance system and the susceptibility to apoptosis, immunohistochemical staining of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DRalpha, cathepsin D, B cell leukemia-2 (bcl-2), bcl-2-associated X protein (bax) and caspase 3 was also performed. Heterogeneous expression of CK 8 and CK 18 was observed in hepatocytes of AIH, while homogeneous expression was observed in hepatocytes of CH-C. Aberrant expression of CK 7 and CK 19 was observed in hepatocytes of AIH, while it was not in hepatocytes of CH-C.

Subsequent transesterification affords a series of monoesters (7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid monomethyl ester (7)), 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid monopropyl ester (8), (7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid monohexyl ester (9)) and differentially substituted diesters (7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid 2-ethyl ester 3-isopropyl ester) (10), and (7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylic acid 2-ethyl ester 3-phenyl ester) (11). Analogues were firstly screened for their ability to inhibit protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A) as the lead compounds cantharidin (1) and norcantharidin (2) are known PP1 and PP2A inhibitors. Only analogues 4a, 6-8 displayed good PP1 and PP2A inhibition (PP1 IC(50)'s=2.0, 2.96, 4.71, and 4.82 microM, respectively; PP2A IC(50)'s=0.2, 0.45, 0.41, and 0.47 microM, respectively).

Analogues possessing good PP1 and/or PP2A inhibition also returned moderate to good anti-cancer activity. Analogues with substituents directly attached to the intact bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane skeleton were poor to moderate anti-cancer agents. This correlates well with their lack of PP1 or PP2A activity. Analogues capable of undergoing a facile ring opening of the anhydride or with a single carboxylate were good PP1 and PP2A inhibitors, largely correlating to the observed anti-cancer activity in all cases, except 11. Analogue 11, whist neither a PP1 nor a PP2A inhibitor shows anti-cancer activity comparable to 1 and 2. We believe that intracellular esterases generate the corresponding dicarboxylate, which is a potent PP1 and PP2A inhibitor, and that it is this species which is responsible for the observed anti-cancer activity.","['McCluskey, Adam', 'Ackland, Stephen P', 'Bowyer, Michael C', 'Baldwin, Monique L', 'Garner, James', 'Walkom, Cecilia C', 'Sakoff, Jennette A']","['McCluskey A', 'Ackland SP', 'Bowyer MC', 'Baldwin ML', 'Garner J', 'Walkom CC', 'Sakoff JA']","['Medicinal Chemistry Group, Chemistry, The University of Newcastle, University Drive, Callaghan, NSW, 2308, Australia. amcclusk@mail.newcastle.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Bioorg Chem,Bioorganic chemistry,1303703,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Cantharidin/analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/pathology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*pathology']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2004/01/09 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0045206802005242 [pii]', '10.1016/s0045-2068(02)00524-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Bioorg Chem. 2003 Feb;31(1):68-79. doi: 10.1016/s0045-2068(02)00524-2.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'IGL471WQ8P (Cantharidin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two regimens were used for prophylaxis of GVHD: one was the combination of low dose cyclosporine (CsA, 2 - 3 mg x kg(-1) x d(-)1 i.v. or 4 - 6 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) p.o.) and short course methotrexate (MTX, 15 approximately 10 mg, +1, +3, +6, +11 d) (CsA/MTX group, 32 patients), the other was short course of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, 1.0 bid, +1 - +28 d) in addition to CsA and MTX (MMF/CsA/MTX group, 18 patients).

METHODS: Seventeen patients (13 children and 4 adults) with hematological malignancies were enrolled in this study. Twelve patients were transplanted with one unit and 5 with 2 units of cord blood. There were HLA-matched in 6 and HLA-mismatched at 1 approximately 2 loci in 11 patients. Ten patients were transplanted at stable status, 7 at advanced stage of leukemia. Conditioning regimens were BU/CY for 13 and CY/TBI for 3 patients. Most patients received additional ATG at a dose of 15 approximately 20 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) for 3 days. CsA, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and methylprednisolone were used for GVHD prophylaxis. RESULTS: Fourteen patients survived more than 40 days after transplantation were evaluated for engraftment. At day 60 after UCBT, 86% and 71% of the patients showed neutrophil and platelet engraftment, respectively. The time for an absolute neutrophil count > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L was (21.0 +/- 1.3) days and platelet > or = 20 x 10(9)/L was (39.0 +/- 10.3) days. Four patients developed grade II acute GVHD and 2 chronic GVHD. Of the 17 patients, 11 were still alive and 8 of them were in event-free status. For the 10 patients transplanted at stable status, 2 year overall survival is 90%, and event-free survival (EFS) 70%. However, for the 7 patients transplanted at advanced stage of leukemia, only 2 survived without relapse. Of the 4 adult patients, 2 had sustained engraftment and survived for 18 and 14 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-matched or 1 approximately 2 loci-mismatched UCBT is a feasible procedure to cure a significant proportion of children or adults with leukemia, especially if performed in a favourable phase of disease. Two units of CBT can be used for adult patients if the cell number of one unit is not enough.","['Ren, Han-yun', 'Zhang, Yao-chen', 'Huang, Xiao-jun', 'Xu, Lan-ping', 'Liu, Kai-yan', 'Li, Dan', 'Guo, Nai-lan', 'Lu, Dao-pei']","['Ren HY', 'Zhang YC', 'Huang XJ', 'Xu LP', 'Liu KY', 'Li D', 'Guo NL', 'Lu DP']","[""Institute of Hematology & People's Hospital, Peking University, Beijing 100044, China.""]",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/09/10 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/10 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 2003 Feb;24(2):82-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: CD(34)(+) cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood and normal bone marrow by Mini MACS system. By zymogram analysis, MMP-2 and MMP-9 were detected in the serum free condition medium of CD(34)(+) cells and cell lines. RESULTS: One brilliant band with molecular weight of 92 x 10(3) was detected in condition medium of cord blood CD(34)(+) cells.

The therapeutic potential of allogeneic SCT relies on the graft versus leukemia (GVL) effect, during which donor T lymphocytes eradicate residual malignant cells via immunological mechanisms. Unfortunately, beneficial GVL effects are closely associated with the toxicity of GVHD. The pathophysiology of GVHD is complex and fundamentally depends upon aspects of adaptive immunity and interactions between donor T cells and foreign host tissue antigens. Recent work has revealed that components of the innate immune response and the secretion of inflammatory cytokine effectors are also important. In this context, experimental studies have demonstrated that loss of gastrointestinal (GI) tract integrity plays a major role in the amplification of systemic GVHD. Specifically, translocation of endotoxin across a damaged GI tract and into the circulation promotes local and systemic cytokine release. This effect perpetuates further gut mucosal injury and endotoxin leak, thus establishing a positive feedback loop for progressive target organ injury and systemic inflammation. Data obtained using murine SCT models have shown that disruption of the cellular activating effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly reduces cytokine secretion and GVHD severity without altering T-cell responses to host antigens. These findings support a critical role for LPS in the early inflammatory events responsible for GVHD and suggest that strategies which target the innate immune response and LPS receptor-ligand interactions may help prevent GVHD while preserving donor T-cell responses and GVL activity.","['Cooke, Kenneth R', 'Olkiewicz, Krystyna', 'Erickson, Nicole', 'Ferrara, James L M']","['Cooke KR', 'Olkiewicz K', 'Erickson N', 'Ferrara JL']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Blood and Marrow Transplantation Program, University of Michigan Cancer Center, Ann Arbor 48109, USA. krcooke@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Endotoxin Res,Journal of endotoxin research,9433350,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Digestive System Physiological Phenomena', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology/physiopathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation', 'Ligands', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",53,2003/04/17 05:00,2003/07/25 05:00,['2003/04/17 05:00'],"['2003/04/17 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1179/096805102125001046 [doi]'],ppublish,J Endotoxin Res. 2002;8(6):441-8. doi: 10.1179/096805102125001046.,"['HL-03565/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-55162/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism of escape from cellular anti-viral mechanisms is not yet fully understood. The promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) associated nuclear body is part of the interferon inducible cellular defense system. Several RNA viruses have been found to interfere with the anti-viral function of the PML body. The possible interaction between Ebola virus and the PML bodies has not yet been explored. RESULTS: We found that two cell lines, Vero E6 and MCF7, support virus production at high and low levels respectively. The expression of viral proteins was visualized and quantified using high resolution immunofluorescence microscopy. Ebola encoded NP and VP35 accumulated in cytoplasmic inclusion bodies whereas VP40 was mainly membrane associated but it was also present diffusely in the cytoplasm as well as in the euchromatic areas of the nucleus. The anti-VP40 antibody also allowed the detection of extracellular virions. Interferon-alpha treatment decreased the production of all three viral proteins and delayed the development of cytopathic effects in both cell lines. Virus infection and interferon-alpha treatment induced high levels of PML protein expression in MCF7 but much less in Vero E6 cells. No disruption of PML bodies, a common phenomenon induced by a variety of different viruses, was observed. CONCLUSION: We have established a simple fixation and immunofluorescence staining procedure that allows specific co-detection and precise sub-cellular localization of the PML nuclear bodies and the Ebola virus encoded proteins NP, VP35 and VP40 in formaldehyde treated cells. Interferon-alpha treatment delays virus production in vitro. Intact PML bodies may play an anti-viral role in Ebola infected cells.","['Bjorndal, Asa Szekely', 'Szekely, Laszlo', 'Elgh, Fredrik']","['Bjorndal AS', 'Szekely L', 'Elgh F']","['Centre for Microbiological Preparedness, Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control (SMI), Nobels vag 18, 17182 Solna, Sweden.

Southern blot analysis indicated that the MLL rearrangement was involved in the chromosomal abnormality. cDNA panhandle polymerase chain reaction identified the fusion transcript, in which MLL exon 6 was fused in-frame with CBL exon 8. Long-distance PCR amplified the genomic junction region, which involved the fusion of the 3' portion of an Alu element in intron 6 of MLL with the 5' portion of an Alu element in intron 7 of CBL. The absence of extensive sequence similarity at both breakpoints of MLL and CBL indicated that the recombination was not generated through homologous recombination. MLL and CBL are located between STS markers D11S939 and D11S924. Analysis of the sequence demonstrated that the transcriptional orientation of both genes at 11q23.3 is from centromere to telomere. The results of Southern blotting in conjunction with fluorescence in situ hybridization suggest that the MLL-CBL fusion was the result of an interstitial deletion. CBL, a proto-oncogene, functions as a negative regulator of several receptor protein-tyrosine-kinase signaling pathways and as an adaptor protein in tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling.

METHODS: Plant lectins with different quaternary structures and saccharide specificity were used: Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA), Soybean agglutinin (SBA) and Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The leukemic cell lines used were: Jurkat, MOLT-4, RPMI-8402, HPB-ALL, CCR-HSB-2 and BALL-1 (derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia); Raji and Daudi (derived from Burkitt's lymphoma); K-562 (derived from myelogenous leukemia). The lectin-cell binding was detected microscopically and fluorimetrically using FITC-conjugated lectins. Cytotoxicity was estimated by the CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay, and cytoagglutinating activity by a spectrophotometric method. RESULTS: The binding of DBA and SBA to normal lymphocytes was negligible, while their binding to leukemic cells increased markedly with increasing lectin concentration. Analogous results were obtained for WGA. However, it was found that WGA also interacted to a significant degree with normal lymphocytes. The degree of lectin-cell binding increased in the order: DBA<SBA<WGA. The cytoagglutinating activity and cytotoxicity of lectins increased in the same order. DBA did not exhibit a cytotoxic effect against normal or leukemic cells, and showed a poor cytoagglutinating activity only in MOLT-4, CCR-HSB-2 and BALL-1 cells. SBA exhibited poor cytotoxicity against Jurkat, RPMI-8402, HPB-ALL and CCR-HSB-2 cells, but a well-defined cytotoxicity against Raji and Daudi cells. SBA showed poor cytoagglutinating activity in leukemic cells. In contrast, WGA at concentrations higher than 0.05 microM showed high cytotoxicity against all leukemic cell lines tested as well as against normal lymphocytes. WGA also showed a well-expressed cytoagglutinating effect in all cell lines except normal lymphocytes. There was a moderate inverse correlation between cell viability and the velocity of cytoagglutination ( r=-0.56, P<0.001), and a good correlation between cell viability and the degree of lectin-cell binding ( r=-0.75, P<0.001). There was a low positive correlation between the velocity of cytoagglutination and the degree of lectin-cell binding ( r=0.43, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the lectins that bound most strongly to leukemic cells expressed higher cytotoxic and cytoagglutinating activities.","['Ohba, Hideki', 'Bakalova, Rumiana']","['Ohba H', 'Bakalova R']","['Single-Molecule Bioanalysis Laboratory, National Institute for Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, AIST-Shikoku, 2217-14 Hayashi-cho, Takamatsu, 761-0395, Kagawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Agglutination/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia/blood/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Plant Lectins/*metabolism/*toxicity', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/metabolism', 'Soybean Proteins/metabolism/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wheat Germ Agglutinins/metabolism/toxicity']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/07/30 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2002/10/04 00:00 [received]', '2003/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-003-0607-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Jun;51(6):451-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-003-0607-y.

Toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering N,N-dimethylaniline (greater than 98% pure) in corn oil by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 2 weeks, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Two-Week and Thirteen-Week Studies: In the 2-week studies, doses were 94-1,500 mg/kg; deaths of rats and mice were observed in groups given doses of 750 or 1,500 mg/kg. The final mean body weights of male rats that received 375 or 750 mg/kg were 15% or 47% lower than that of vehicle controls; final mean body weights of other groups of rats and mice were similar to those of vehicle controls. Compound-related clinical signs observed included cyanosis in rats and lethargy and tremors in rats and mice. Splenomegaly occurred in nearly all dosed groups of rats and mice, and the incidences were dose related. In the 13-week studies, doses were 32-500 mg/kg; no compound-related deaths occurred. The final mean body weights of male rats that received 250 or 500 mg/kg were 15% or 27% lower than that of vehicle controls. The final mean body weights of all groups of dosed female rats and male and female mice were within 12% of those of vehicle controls. Compound-related clinical signs included lethargy in rats and mice and cyanosis in rats. Splenomegaly was observed in all dosed groups of rats and mice; the severity was dose related. Compound-related extramedullary hematopoiesis and hemosiderosis occurred in the kidney or testis of dosed rats and liver and spleen of dosed rats and mice. Two-year studies were conducted by administering 0, 3, or 30 mg/kg N,N-dimethylaniline in corn oil by gavage, 5 days per week for 103 weeks, to groups of 50 rats of each sex. The lower dose was selected to be one-tenth the higher dose to increase the likelihood that one dose would cause only a minimal nonneoplastic response. Groups of 50 mice of each sex were administered 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg on the same schedule. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of vehicle control and dosed rats and mice were similar throughout the studies. Survival rates of all respective groups were similar after 2 years, except for the lowered survival of vehicle control female rats (vehicle control, 21/50; low dose 32/50; high dose, 36/50). This may reflect the large number (24/50) of vehicle control female rats killed when observed to be in a moribund state. Final survival for other groups was as follows: male rats--29/50; 32/50; 28/50; male mice-- 34/50; 30/50; 34/50; female mice--35/50; 39/50; 33/50. Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: In these 2-year studies, the spleen was the expected site of chemical-related effects. Fatty metamorphosis and fibrosis in the spleen of high dose male rats were increased (fatty metamorphosis: vehicle control, 0/49; low dose, 1/49; high dose, 10/50; fibrosis: 5/49; 2/49; 22/50). Splenic hemosiderosis and hematopoiesis were present at an incidence greater than 85% in all groups of rats; however, the severity of the lesions was greater in dosed groups than in vehicle controls. Sarcomas of the spleen were seen in 3/50 high dose male rats, and an osteosarcoma was seen in another high dose male rat. One additional high dose male rat had a sarcoma of the thymus. Splenic sarcomas are uncommon in corn oil vehicle control male F344/N rats (NTP historical incidence 3/2,081, 0.1%), and thus, these neoplasms in high dose male rats (4/50, 8%) were considered to be chemically related. Lower incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia (which apparently originates in the spleen) were seen in dosed male and female rats than in vehicle controls (male: 13/50; 4/50; 3/50; female: 11/50; 7/50; 0/50). The incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach in high dose female mice was marginally greater than that in vehicle controls (2/50; 2/50; 8/50). No malignant forestomacin vehicle controls (2/50; 2/50; 8/50). No malignant forestomach neoplasms were observed. Genetic Toxicology: N,N-Dimethylaniline was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 in the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation. In the mouse lymphoma assay, N,N-dimethylaniline produced a positive response with and without metabolic activation. In CHO cells, N,N-dimethylaniline induced both sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations in the presence of exogenous metabolic activation. Without activation, an increase in chromosomal aberrations was observed, but no increase in SCEs occurred. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of N,N-dimethylaniline for male F344/N rats, as indicated by the increased incidences of sarcomas or osteosarcomas(combined) of the spleen. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of N,N-dimethylaniline for female F344/N rats given 3 or 30 mg/kg body weight by gavage for 2 years. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of N,N-dimethylaniline for male B6C3F1 mice given 15 or 30 mg/kg body weight by gavage for 2 years. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of N,N-dimethylaniline for female B6C3F1 mice, as indicated by an increased incidence of squamous cell papillomas of the forestomach. Both rats and mice could have tolerated doses higher than those used in these studies. There were decreased incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia in dosed male and high dose female rats. Compound-related splenic fibrosis, hemosiderosis, and fatty metamorphosis were increased in male rats.

In this study we analysed the in vitro responses of lymphocytes from two LFS patients to chemotherapeutic drugs in terms of apoptosis induction and the expression of key intracellular proteins that regulate this process. One of the LFS patients also suffered from B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and hence presented with a light-chain restricted B-cell lymphocytosis while the other patient had entirely normal blood counts. The B-lymphocytes from both LFS patients showed a marked degree of resistance to chlorambucil and fludarabine when compared to age-matched controls but were remarkably sensitive to the novel flavone, flavopiridol. Loss of function of p53 was demonstrated by a failure to induce Bax and p21 protein expression. In addition, altered basal expression patterns of Bcl-2 and Bax, two key regulators of apoptosis, were found in the LFS lymphocytes when compared with controls. These results suggest that LFS lymphocytes carrying a p53 mutation show intrinsic resistance to conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and this is associated with dysregulation of Bcl-2 family proteins. Furthermore, The innate resistance profile was similar in leukemic and non-leukemic lymphocytes and was therefore independent of genetic changes acquired during malignant transformation. Novel agents that induce p53-independent cell killing may be useful not only in the treatment of LFS-associated tumors but also drug resistant tumors in general where p53 and/or Bcl-2 family dysregulation is a feature.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Tighe, Jane', 'Culligan, Dominic', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Bentley, Paul']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Hoy T', 'Tighe J', 'Culligan D', 'Fegan C', 'Bentley P']","['Llandough Hospital, Penlan Road, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan CF64 2XX, Wales, UK. chrisp@llanhaem.demon.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/08/14 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",['249 [pii]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2003 Jan-Feb;2(1):53-8.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report three cases of CD4+ CD56+ malignancies with cutaneous lesions in three cases and also bone marrow involvement in two cases. Two patients relapsed 2 and 3 months after polychemotherapy. Two patients died within 3-10 months. A constant immunophenotype was observed with the co-expression of CD4 and CD56, the absence of B and T-cell markers. The salient fact of this report is the presence of T-cell clonal rearrangement. The clinical and pathological features closely resemble the specific cutaneous manifestations in acute leukemia with monocytic differentiation, especially the granulocytic sarcoma. Because of the positivity of the CD56, natural killer cell proliferations were discussed. Since 1994, 50 cases of CD4+, CD56+ cutaneous neoplasms have been reported with specific clinical, cytologic and immunohistochemical features. The diagnosis is more difficult when the cutaneous location is exclusive; on the contrary, the cytological features of the blood and medullar cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles and pseudopodia are characteristic of this hematologic neoplasm. The presence of CD123 antigen in most of the cases is an argument for a plasmacytoid dendritic cell proliferation and it is also a good marker for primary cutaneous lesions.","['Penven, Katell', 'Macro, Margaret', 'Salaun, Veronique', 'Comoz, Francois', 'Reman, Oumedaly', 'Leroy, Dominique', 'Troussard, Xavier', 'Petrella, Tony', 'Dompmartin, Anne']","['Penven K', 'Macro M', 'Salaun V', 'Comoz F', 'Reman O', 'Leroy D', 'Troussard X', 'Petrella T', 'Dompmartin A']","['Department of Dermatology, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire, Avenue Georges Clemenceau, 14033 Caen Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",France,Eur J Dermatol,European journal of dermatology : EJD,9206420,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD56 Antigen/*immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/immunology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology/*pathology/therapy']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Dermatol. 2003 Mar-Apr;13(2):161-5.,,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme L-asparaginase, which exhibits a short in vivo half-life and is only active against leukaemia in its tetrameric form, was encapsulated in poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) nanospheres by the (w/o)/w-emulsion solvent evaporation technique in presence of various potential stabilisers. Elucidation of the preparation steps revealed that the enzyme is denaturated at the aqueous/organic interface and by sonication. The preparation of L-asparaginase nanospheres with trehalose, PEG 400, and glycerol as components of the inner aqueous phase yielded colloidal formulations with increased biological activity as determined by an improved protocol for quantification of the active enzyme encapsulated. After lyophilisation the enzyme activity and particle size distribution were retained only by use of Pluronic F68 as a lyoprotectant. Despite the unaltered particle size and improved biological activity, the release profile of the enzyme was strongly altered by coencapsulation of the stabilisers resulting in increased first bursts. In consequence, the biological activity of L-asparaginase during preparation and storage can be improved by combining appropriate additives but concurrently the release profile is influenced.","['Wolf, M', 'Wirth, M', 'Pittner, F', 'Gabor, F']","['Wolf M', 'Wirth M', 'Pittner F', 'Gabor F']","['Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biopharmaceutics, Pharma Center Vienna, Althanstrasse 14, A-1090, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Int J Pharm,International journal of pharmaceutics,7804127,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Drug Carriers/chemistry', 'Drug Compounding', 'Enzyme Stability', 'Excipients/chemistry', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Lactic Acid/*chemistry', 'Nanotechnology', 'Particle Size', 'Polyglycolic Acid/*chemistry', 'Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Solubility', 'Solutions']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/08/02 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0378517303000711 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-5173(03)00071-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Pharm. 2003 Apr 30;256(1-2):141-52. doi: 10.1016/s0378-5173(03)00071-1.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Excipients)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Solutions)', '1SIA8062RS (Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer)', '26009-03-0 (Polyglycolic Acid)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The A-bomb survivors show an excess incidence of carcinomas in tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract, breast, thyroid, and bladder, which is linear with dose up to about 2.5 Sv. There is great uncertainty concerning the dose-response relationship for radiation-induced carcinogenesis at higher doses. Some animal and human data suggest a decrease at higher doses, usually attributed to cell killing; other data suggest a plateau in dose. Radiotherapy patients also show an excess incidence of carcinomas, often in sites remote from the treatment fields; in addition there is an excess incidence of sarcomas in the heavily irradiated in-field tissues. The transition from conventional radiotherapy to three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) involves a reduction in the volume of normal tissues receiving a high dose, with an increase in dose to the target volume that includes the tumor and a limited amount of normal tissue. One might expect a decrease in the number of sarcomas induced and also (less certain) a small decrease in the number of carcinomas. All around, a good thing. By contrast, the move from 3D-CRT to intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) involves more fields, and the dose-volume histograms show that, as a consequence, a larger volume of normal tissue is exposed to lower doses. In addition, the number of monitor units is increased by a factor of 2 to 3, increasing the total body exposure, due to leakage radiation. Both factors will tend to increase the risk of second cancers.

BH3-containing peptides induce apoptosis by binding to the hydrophobic pocket of the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL. A small cell-permeable compound, BH3I-2' (3-iodo-5-chloro-N-[2-chloro-5-((4-chlorophenyl)sulphonyl)phenyl]-2-hydroxybenzam ide), has been recently reported to have a function similar to Bak BH3 peptide. BH3I-2' induces apoptosis by disrupting interactions mediated by the BH3 domain, between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family. This study found that BH3I-2' induced cytochrome c release from the mitochondrial outer membrane in a Bax-dependent manner and that this correlated with the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to apoptosis. Moreover, it also induced rapid damage to the inner mitochondrial membrane, represented by a rapid collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), prior to the cytochrome c release. This occurred both in whole cells and isolated mitochondria, and was not associated with the sensitivity of cells to BH3I-2'-induced apoptosis. Exogenous Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL neutralized BH3I-2'in vitro and diminished its effect on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Our results indicate that BH3I-2' not only induces cytochrome c release from the outer mitochondrial membrane but also damages the inner mitochondrial membrane, probably by interacting with Bcl-2 family proteins.","['Feng, Wan-Yu', 'Liu, Feng-Ting', 'Patwari, Yasmeen', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Newland, Adrian C', 'Jia, Li']","['Feng WY', 'Liu FT', 'Patwari Y', 'Agrawal SG', 'Newland AC', 'Jia L']","[""Department of Haematology, St Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', '*Biomimetic Materials', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/*drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['4268 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04268.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Apr;121(2):332-40. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04268.x.,,"['0', '(3-iodo-5-chloro-N-(2-chloro-5-((4-chlorophenyl)sulphonyl)phenyl)-2-hydroxybenzam', 'ide)', '0 (Bax protein (53-86))', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nonetheless, relapses impair these results and justify the search for novel therapeutic strategies. Clinical data demonstrate that the immune system plays an important role in the control of haematological malignancies. An increased frequency of haematological malignancies is observed in immunodeficiency states. Reversal of the immunosuppression is sometimes sufficient to induce tumour regression (withdrawal of cyclosporine in post-transplant lymphoproliferations, highly active anti-retroviral treatment in human immunodeficiency virus related Kaposi's disease). Another line of evidence for the involvement of the immune system in the anti-tumour response comes from the observation of spontaneous anti-tumour responses that parallel the occurrence of paraneoplastic immune-mediated syndromes. Finally, the efficiency of allogeneic transplantation in the haematological field has been clearly demonstrated to depend on the immune-mediated graft vs. leukaemia effect. Nonetheless, tumours develop in immune competent patients because of various tumour escape mechanisms, such as loss of human leucocyte antigen class I antigens, absence of target recognition by deficient adhesion/co-stimulatory molecule expression, tumour cell counterattack against immune effectors, direct (contact-dependent) or indirect (cytokine-mediated) impairment of T-lymphocyte activation. Novel immunotherapy approaches are now orientated in a convergent direction, i.e. the reversal of immune escape mechanisms either via the correction of deficient phases of the immune response or by the amplification of physiological mechanisms.","['Costello, Regis T', 'Rey, J', 'Fauriat, C', 'Gastaut, J-A', 'Olive, D']","['Costello RT', 'Rey J', 'Fauriat C', 'Gastaut JA', 'Olive D']","[""Departement d'Hematologie and Laboratoire d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Autoimmunity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cancer Vaccines/therapeutic use', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunotherapy/methods/*trends', 'Models, Immunological', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",82,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['065 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00065.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 May;70(5):333-45. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00065.x.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous methods for determination of MDR1 expression have included dye exclusion, demonstration of P-glycoprotein by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry, and molecular polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assays for RNA expression. However, these assays have either proven difficult to standardize or tedious to perform. We have therefore designed a real-time quantitative (RQ)-PCR based assay measuring MDR1 gene expression and validated it in AML patients by direct comparison with a competitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow or peripheral blood from 101 AML patients diagnosed (1987-96) at our department were assessed for quantitative expression of MDR1 employing TaqMan RQ-PCR. These data were compared with results obtained by a semi-quantitative competitive PCR assay employing an artificial internal RNA construct. RESULTS: While the RQ-PCR method was able to determine MDR1 gene expression in a continuous fashion over five logs, the semi-quantitative PCR only yielded data in a discontinuous fashion and over four logs at best. Compared with the MDR1 positive and negative cell lines 8226 DOX40 and REH AML cells exhibited variation of 10 PCR cycles, equivalent to a 1000-fold difference. A significant correlation was observed between the two methods, Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.502, P-value = 10-5. CONCLUSION: We conclude that, RQ-PCR is a novel methodology, which enables sensitive and quantitative measurement of MDR1 gene expression. This assay is moreover suitable because of its high throughput for longitudinal follow-up and large number of patients.","['Olesen, L H', 'Norgaard, J M', 'Pallisgaard, N', 'Bukh, A', 'Hokland, P']","['Olesen LH', 'Norgaard JM', 'Pallisgaard N', 'Bukh A', 'Hokland P']","['Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. lene.hyldahl.olesen@aas.auh.dk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, MDR', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/statistics & numerical data', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['060 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00060.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 May;70(5):296-303. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00060.x.,,['0 (DNA Primers)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these malignant cells die rapidly in vitro. In the current study we concentrated on the contribution of autologous serum (AS) and lymphocyte subsets to the survival of the malignant cells in vitro. METHODS: Mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of 26 CLL patients and 24 controls were incubated overnight in the presence or absence of AS and heat-inactivated AS (HI-AS) or fetal calf serum (FCS). Also, isolated B cells were incubated at different concentrations in the presence of AS and/or isolated T cells. The level of apoptosis of CD19+ cells was measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Spontaneous apoptosis of unfractionated B-CLL cells incubated with AS, FCS or without serum was significantly lower than the rate of B-cell death in the control group, in similar culture conditions. AS had an antiapoptotic effect on unfractionated B-CLL cells when compared with FCS. The rate of apoptosis of B-CLL cells was directly associated with stage. HI of AS had a variable effect, which was related to the stage of the disease. High concentrations of B cells and the addition of autologous T cells reduced the rate of apoptosis when incubated without serum. The antiapoptotic effect of T cells was most prominent in progressive stages. CONCLUSIONS: B-CLL cells exhibit decreased spontaneous apoptosis, which is partially prevented by humoral (AS) and cellular (T cells and B-CLL cells) factors. The equilibrium between apoptotic and antiapoptotic factors changes with disease progression.","['Bomstein, Yonit', 'Yuklea, Mona', 'Radnay, Judith', 'Shapiro, Hava', 'Afanasyev, Faina', 'Yarkoni, Shai', 'Lishner, Michael']","['Bomstein Y', 'Yuklea M', 'Radnay J', 'Shapiro H', 'Afanasyev F', 'Yarkoni S', 'Lishner M']","['Oncogenetic Laboratory, Sapir Medical Center, Meir Hospital, Kfar-Sava, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cattle', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']","['063 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00063.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2003 May;70(5):290-5. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2003.00063.x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Culture Media)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CRPs were purified from several samples in six different pathological conditions, where their levels ranged from 22 to 342 microg/ml. Small, but significant, variations in electrophoretic mobilities on native PAGE suggested differences in molecular mass, charge and/or shape. Following separation by SDS/PAGE, they showed single subunits with some differences in their molecular masses ranging between 27 and 30.5 kDa, but for a particular disease, the mobility was the same for CRPs purified from multiple individuals or pooled sera. Isoelectric focusing (IEF) also indicated that the purified CRPs differed from each other. Glycosylation was demonstrated in these purified CRPs by Digoxigenin kits, neuraminidase treatment and binding with lectins. The presence of N-linked sugar moiety was confirmed by N-glycosidase F digestion. The presence of sialic acid, glucose, galactose and mannose has been demonstrated by gas liquid chromatography, mass spectroscopic and fluorimetric analysis. Matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization analysis of the tryptic digests of three CRPs showed systematic absence of two peptide fragments, one at the N-terminus and the other near the C-terminus. Model-building suggested that the loss of these fragments exposed two potential glycosylation sites on a cleft floor keeping the protein-protein interactions in pentraxins and calcium-dependent phosphorylcholine-binding qualitatively unaffected.

Comparison of chemical structure of PTX with other above xanthines has revealed only one marked difference. PTX contains extended aliphatic chain containing reactive electrophilic carbonyl group in the position N1. The investigation of possibility that this group is crucial for PTX-induced MDR reversal represents the aim of the current paper. To prove this hypothesis, we used the new synthesized PTX derivative in which the carbonyl group is modified by a substance containing amino-group and the product of reaction is the respective Schiff base (SB). Successful reaction was observed when PTX reacted with 3,5-diaminobenzenesulfonyl acid (DABS). The product of reaction of DABS with carbonyl group of aliphatic part of PTX was proved using NMR and IR spectroscopy. We found that the resulting PTX derivative PTX-SB revealed higher cytotoxicity on both sensitive L1210 and multidrug resistant L1210/VCR cells than PTX. Moreover, PTX-SB exerts more pronounced MDR reversal effect on L1210/VCR cells than PTX. These results indicate that electrophilic carbonyl group on aliphatic chain located in position N1 of PTX is not essential for MDR reversal effects of PTX.","['Kupsakova, I', 'Docolomansky, P', 'Rybar, A', 'Barancik, M', 'Breier, A']","['Kupsakova I', 'Docolomansky P', 'Rybar A', 'Barancik M', 'Breier A']","['Institute for Heart Research, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Dubravska cesta 9, 842 33 Bratislava 4, Slovakia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Gen Physiol Biophys,General physiology and biophysics,8400604,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Pentoxifylline/analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology', 'Xanthines/*pharmacology']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/10/17 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Gen Physiol Biophys. 2002 Dec;21(4):471-8.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Xanthines)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'SD6QCT3TSU (Pentoxifylline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer (CB), soaked in 2.2 mol/l sucrose and frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were cut at a temperature of -90 degrees C, transferred to Formvar coated copper grids, postfixed with 1% OsO4 and stained with 0.05% RR in CB for 60-120 min. After removing RR solution with filter the grids were dried and examined electron microscopically. The resulting staining was a combination of a negative contrast (the plasma membrane and membranes of intracellular organelles) and of a positive contrast (cytoplasmic matrix and the extracellular coat).

Analysis of the narratives was used to measure the integration of these experiences into personal biography. Good integration correlated positively with good body concepts. Siblings with good integration also scored lower for fatalistic health locus of control and perceived the illness retrospectively as more distressing than those with poor integration. In contrast, integration did not correlate with distress evoked by present feelings towards illness and therapy or by thoughts of a relapse or a personal cancer illness. The findings of this exploratory investigation may suggest that successful integration of the experiences associated with a brother's or sister's cancer is associated with a trustful relation to the own body and with the ability to accept painful feelings and to allow them to emerge.

These processes have several crossing points, one of them is the role of inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases. The aim of this study was to study the expression of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors p21 Cip and p27 Kip and expression of proliferative antigen Ki-67 in leukocytes of human leukemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: The expression of cyclin-dependent kinases inhibitors was detected at mRNA level mainly by comparative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and in selected samples also by the real-time polymerase chain reaction. While p27 Kip expression in leukocytes of leukemic patients and healthy persons was universal, large differences in expression of p21 Cip were found both among individual patients of the same type of leukemia and between different types of leukemias and healthy persons. The p21 Cip expression was significantly higher in acute leukemias than in chronic ones and healthy persons. A comparison of p21 Cip expression with the clinical outcome of the leukemic patients showed that the group of 14 acute leukemia patients surviving more than 30 months had a significantly lower expression of p21 Cip than 12 patients of this type of leukemia who died within this time limit. Moreover, the results obtained on a smaller set of acute promyelocytic leukemia patients indicated that the lower p21 expression is connected with a better prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our results pointed out the importance of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 Cip in human leukemias and indicated that the lower p21 Cip expression might be a positive prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia patients.","['Polak, J', 'Pekova, S', 'Schwarz, J', 'Kozak, T', 'Haskovec, C']","['Polak J', 'Pekova S', 'Schwarz J', 'Kozak T', 'Haskovec C']","['Ustav hematologie a krevni transfuze, Praha. japol@uhkt.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism']",,2003/04/16 05:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/04/16 05:00'],"['2003/04/16 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2003 Jan 20;142(1):25-8.,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",,,,,Exprese inhibitoru cyklin-dependentnich kinaz u leukemii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Safety considerations dictate the need for equipping the transferred cells with a conditional suicide mechanism to eliminate donor T cells when graft-versus-host disease occurs. We have examined in a model system using HeLa cells whether doxycycline (dox)-dependent expression of pro-apoptotic proteins could be used as a potential new strategy for conditional cell elimination. METHODS: Four constructs encoding pro-apoptotic proteins were tested in transient transfections to identify suitable cell death inducers. Murine caspase-2 placed under Tet-control was chosen for stable transfection into cell lines carrying different dox-dependent transregulators. The efficiency of cell death induction and the expression patterns of caspase-2 were analyzed in the respective clones. RESULTS: Different levels of induced cell death were obtained depending on the properties of the transregulators used to control target gene expression. High expression levels of caspase-2 in the presence of dox were required to achieve efficient induction of cell death, while tight repression in the absence of inducer was not necessary for cell survival. Dox treatment for 48 h resulted in 94% cell death indicating a very efficient conditional suicide mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that the principle of using pro-apoptotic cellular proteins placed under appropriate dox-dependent regulation may represent an alternative conditional suicide mechanism to the frequently used herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK)/ganciclovir-system, which harbors immunological and toxicological risks.","['Knott, Anja', 'Muller, Yvonne', 'Zunino, Susan J', 'Berens, Christian', 'Hillen, Wolfgang']","['Knott A', 'Muller Y', 'Zunino SJ', 'Berens C', 'Hillen W']","['Lehrstuhl fur Mikrobiologie, Friedrich-Alexander-Universitat Erlangen-Nurnberg, Staudtstr. 5, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Arabidopsis Proteins/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspase 2', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/drug effects/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Doxycycline/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.342 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2003 Apr;5(4):343-54. doi: 10.1002/jgm.342.,,"['0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.99.- (Fad7 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ripk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Casp3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 2)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'N12000U13O (Doxycycline)']",,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty eight predominately pediatric patients [39 male, 19 female; mean age 12.3 years (range 2.2-34.1)] suffering from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 28), Non Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL, n = 13), osteosarcoma (n = 8), malignant brain tumor (n = 6), or an ALL relapse (n = 3), were prospectively examined. In the course of 220 infusions of HD-MTX, glomerular and tubular renal function was determined by measuring proteinuria and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as well as renal excretion of alpha-1-microglobulin (AMG) and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG). It was investigated whether there were differences in MTX toxicity in dependence on the administered dose (1, 5, or 12 g/m(2) BSA), on the combination with other cytostatic agents (ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide), on the metabolism of MTX into 7-OH-MTX, and on pre-treatment with MTX. RESULTS: The administration of HD-MTX has no direct tubulotoxic effect. The disturbance in glomerular function was dose dependently and indicated by an increase in proteinuria as well as by a decrease in GFR; all changes were completely reversible and did not correlate to the metabolism of MTX to 7-OH-MTX. Increasing the number of MTX therapeutic cycles did not increase the nephrotoxicity of MTX. CONCLUSION: MTX is not directly tubulotoxic. Its side effects on glomeruli are usually without clinical relevance.","['Hempel, Lutz', 'Misselwitz, Joachim', 'Fleck, Christian', 'Kentouche, Karim', 'Leder, Christiane', 'Appenroth, Dorothea', 'Rost, Michael', 'Zintl, Felix']","['Hempel L', 'Misselwitz J', 'Fleck C', 'Kentouche K', 'Leder C', 'Appenroth D', 'Rost M', 'Zintl F']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Kidney Diseases/*chemically induced/physiopathology', 'Kidney Tubules/*drug effects/pathology/*physiology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteinuria/etiology']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10293 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 Jun;40(6):348-54. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10293.,,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, little is known as to whether these mutations are preexisting or develop under imatinib therapy as current mutation analyses are limited by a low sensitivity of approximately 1:2 (50%) to 1:5 (20%). By combining peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based DNA clamping with a fluorescence hybridization probe assay, we developed a new and highly sensitive technique for the detection of known mutations within the Bcr/Abl kinase domain. With this approach we investigated 19 cases of CML refractory to imatinib treatment before and during therapy. By clamping of wild-type Abl through PNA we could effectively enhance the detection sensitivity for the Bcr/Abl mutations Thr315Ile, Glu255Lys, and Tyr253His such that 1 mutant cDNA molecule could be detected in 500 negatives (0.2%). We observed in one case that a Gly255Lys mutation was detectable before treatment. By DNA analysis of buccal swaps, a genetic polymorphism could be excluded. In two cases clonal evolution of known mutations developed gradually under treatment. In another case an initially detectable Tyr253His mutation disappeared after therapy onset but was again observed after 6 weeks of imatinib treatment. Preexisting and evolving Bcr/Abl mutations associated with an unfavorable prognosis could be safely detected by the presented technique. This may facilitate risk stratification in CML and may serve as a model for individualized molecular monitoring and therapeutic strategies in other malignant diseases.","['Kreuzer, K-A', 'Le Coutre, P', 'Landt, O', 'Na, I-K', 'Schwarz, M', 'Schultheis, K', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Dorken, B']","['Kreuzer KA', 'Le Coutre P', 'Landt O', 'Na IK', 'Schwarz M', 'Schultheis K', 'Hochhaus A', 'Dorken B']","['Medizinische Klinik m.S.

Five anthraquinone-derived dyes with representative and diverse structures, as well as the parent chemical, anthraquinone, were selected for NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis evaluation. Similar to the benzidine dye initiative, the rationale for selecting these vat dyes was to generate sufficient toxicologic data to permit more reliable predictions of carcinogenicity to be made on other chemicals in this class, thereby eliminating or reducing the need to study every anthraquinone dye. 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone is the last anthraquinone-derived dye in this group to be studied. Groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone (87% to 97% pure) for 13 weeks or for 9, 15, or 24 months. Because 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was predicted to be carcinogenic, these studies were designed to evaluate the potential for tumor progression and regression. Absorption and excretion studies were carried out in male F344/N rats. Genetic toxicity was determined in vitro using Salmonella typhimurium and cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. Extensive chemical analyses were performed to identify and characterize impurities of the 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone used in these studies. 13-WEEK STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were given 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 13 weeks. These levels correspond to approximately 150 to 3,200 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body weight per day for males and to approximately 170 to 3,200 mg/kg for females. Chemical-related mortality was limited to one male and one female in the 50,000 ppm groups. Final mean body weights and body weight gains of all exposed groups of rats were significantly lower than those of the controls. Feed consumption by all exposed groups was less than that by the controls throughout the study and generally decreased with increasing exposure concentration. Pink-red staining of the fur and tail was observed in all exposed groups. Absolute and relative liver weights of all exposed groups were generally significantly greater than those of the controls. Chemical-related lesions were present in the liver, kidney, and spleen of male and female rats. Nonneoplastic lesions in the liver included foci of hepatocellular alteration, diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy (cytomegaly), hepatocellular cytoplasmic vacuolation, bile duct hyperplasia, inflammation, and pigmentation. These differences were observed primarily in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups of males and females; the spectrum of proliferative lesions of the bile ducts (hyperplasia, fibrosis, and necrotizing cholangitis) in the 25,000 and 50,000 ppm groups was morphologically consistent with the lesion described as cholangiofibrosis. Pigmentation was present in the renal tubule epithelium of all groups of exposed rats; nuclear enlargement (karyomegaly) was also present in the renal tubule epithelium in some of the exposed rats. Accumulation of hyaline droplets in the cytoplasm of the renal tubule epithelium and tubule lumina was present in 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, and 25,000 ppm males. Incidences of hematopoiesis of the spleen in exposed groups of males and females were increased compared to those in the controls. 13-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were given 0, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 25,000, or 50,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 13 weeks. These levels correspond to approximately 500 to 10,600 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body weight per day for males and approximately 660 to 11,700 mg/kg per day for females. There was no chemical-related mortality. Feed consumption and final mean body weights of exposed groups were similar to those of the controls. Red staining of the fur was observed in all exposed groups. Absolute and relative liver weights of the exposed groups were greater than those er than those of the controls except for the absolute liver weight of 2,500 ppm males. Absolute and relative kidney weights of 25,000 and 50,000 ppm males were lower than those of the controls. Chemical-related lesions were limited to the livers of males and consisted of pigmentation of hepatocytes at all exposure concentrations and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy at 10,000, 25,000, and 50,000 ppm. Minimal pigment was present in the liver of one female in the 25,000 ppm group and in one female in the 50,000 ppm group. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 70 male and 70 female rats were given 0, 5,000, or 10,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 103 weeks. In addition, groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were given 2,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 104 weeks. These exposure concentrations were approximately equal to 90, 240, or 490 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body weight for males and 110, 285, or 600 mg/kg for females. Ten animals from each group were evaluated for histopathology at 9 months. Additional groups of 10 animals from the 0 and 10,000 ppm groups were evaluated for histopathology at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings In the 2-year study, survival of the 10,000 ppm males and females was significantly lower than that of the controls. Survival of the 2,000 and 5,000 ppm groups was similar to that of the controls. During the last year of the study, the mean body weights of exposed males were 80&percnt; to 91&percnt; those of controls, and the mean body weights of exposed females were 67&percnt; to 84&percnt; those of controls. Feed consumption among exposed groups was generally similar, but was less than that by controls. The fur and urine of all exposed male and female groups were discolored. Pathology Findings In the 2-year study, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was associated with significant chemical-related increases in the incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms in the liver, large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder of males and females. Chemical-related nonneoplastic proliferative and degenerative lesions occurred in the liver, kidney, urinary bladder, and forestomach of males and females. The incidences of foci of hepatocellular alteration and pigmentation in the liver of males and females were increased at the 9-month interim evaluation, and a hepatocellular adenoma was present in one 5,000 ppm male. At the 15-month interim evaluation, hepatocellular adenoma or carcinoma (combined) occurred in all males and nine females in the 10,000 ppm groups. By the end of the 2-year study, hepatocellular adenoma, carcinoma, cholangioma, or cholangiocarcinoma were observed in males and females in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups. In the 2,000 ppm groups, similar liver neoplasms were present in 63&percnt; of the males and in 83&percnt; of the females. Of the hepatocellular carcinomas in the 5,000 and 10,000 ppm groups of males and females, 31&percnt; to 49&percnt; were metastatic to the lungs or other sites. Increases in the incidences of foci of hepatocellular alteration (basophilic, eosinophilic, and clear cell) and pigmentation of the liver were also observed in exposed groups of males and females. Adenomatous polyps (adenoma) of the large intestine were present in six 10,000 ppm males at the 15-month interim evaluation. Incidences of adenomatous polyp (adenoma) and carcinoma of the large intestine were significantly increased in exposed groups of males and females after 2 years; multiple benign and malignant intestinal neoplasms were observed in many of these rats. In the kidney, incidences of renal tubule adenoma and carcinoma were significantly increased in exposed groups of males and females after 2 years. Renal tubule adenomas were present in two 10,000 ppm males at 15 months. There were also chemical-related increases in the incidences and severities of renal tubule epithelial hyperplasia, pigmentation, and transitional cell hyperplasia in the kidney of males and females. Hyaline droplet accumulation was present in all exposed male rats at 9 months. Incidences of transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma of the urinary bladder were increased at 2 years in males and females in the 10,000 ppm groups. Transitional cell hyperplasia was observed in exposed males and females at the 15-month interim evaluation. Other nonneoplastic lesions observed in the urinary bladder at 2 years included metaplasia of the transitional epithelium and submucosal stromal tissue. In the forestomach, the incidences and severities of inflammation, ulceration, hyperkeratosis, and hyperplasia of the squamous mucosa were increased in all exposed groups of males and females at 2 years, but not at the 9- or 15-month interim evaluations. In exposed males and females, the incidences of mononuclear cell leukemia were significantly decreased. The incidences of atrophy of the seminal vesicle were increased in exposed male rats in the 2-year study. Stop-Exposure Evaluation in Rats Groups of 40 male and 40 female rats were given 20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 9 or 15 months. At 9 months, 10 males and 10 females were evaluated for histopathology (9-month interim evaluation groups). After 9 months of exposure, an additional 10 males and 10 females were fed control diet until the end of the 15-month evaluation (9-month stop-exposure groups), and 20 males and 20 females continued to receive 20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone until the end of the evaluation (15-month exposure groups). The approximate daily consumption of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was 1,335 mg/kg for males and 1,790 mg/kg for females in the 9-month stop-exposure groups and 1,115 mg/kg for males and 1,435 mg/kg for females in the 15-month exposure groups. Survival was similar among groups except for the females in the 15-month exposure group; the survival of this group was lower than that of the controls. Lower mean body weights were related to increased exposure duration. The mean body weights of exposed males were 76&percnt; to 82&percnt; that of controls, and the mean body weights of exposed females were 73&percnt; to 84&percnt; that of controls. For the stop-exposure evaluation, similar chemical-related neoplasms and nonneoplastic lesions were observed in the same sites as in the 2-year study: liver, large intestine, kidney, urinary bladder, and forestomach. After 9 months of dietary exposure to a concentration of 20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone, hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma occurred in males and females. Nonneoplastic chemical-related lesions in the liver of exposed rats included pigmentation, focal hepatocellular alteration, and bile duct hyperplasia. Neoplasms at other sites in males included one adenomatous polyp (adenoma) in the large intestine and one transitional cell papilloma in the urinary bladder. Hyaline droplet accumulation was present in the kidney of exposed males at 9 months. In the stop-exposure groups examined at 15 months, hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma were present in most males and females. Adenomatous polyp (adenoma) of the colon, renal tubule cell adenoma, and urinary bladder transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma also occurred in males and females. Nonneoplastic chemical-related lesions included foci of hepatocellular alteration in the liver and hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and urinary bladder transitional epithelium. Hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, inflammation, and ulceration were observed in the forestomach of some male and female rats continuously exposed for 15 months. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 60 male and 60 female mice were given 0, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in feed for 104 weeks. The daily compound consumption was approximately 1,690 or 3,470 mg 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone/kg body weight for males and 1,950 or 4,350 mg/kg for females. Ten animals from each group were evaluated for histopathology at 15 months. Survival, Body Weights, Feed Consumption, and Clinical Findings In the 2-year study, survival of exposed males was significantly lower than that of the controls. Survival of exposed females was similar to that of the controls. The final mean body weights of exposed males were 83&percnt; to 85&percnt; that of controls, and the final mean body weights of exposed females were 81&percnt; to 86&percnt; that of controls. Feed consumption by exposed groups was generally similar to that by controls. Discoloration of the fur, urine, and feces was observed in all exposed groups. Pathology Findings In the 2-year study, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was associated with significant chemical-related increases in the incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung of males and females. Incidences of hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma were increased in exposed groups at the 15-month interim evaluation and at 2 years. At 2 years, there were significant increases in the incidences of multiple hepatocellular adenoma and carcinoma in males and females and in the incidences of hepatoblastoma in males. Centrilobular hypertrophy of hepatocytes in males and foci of hepatocellular alteration and pigmentation in the liver of males and females were also chemical-related changes. Sqamous cell papilloma of the forestomach mucosa occurred in 10,000 ppm females and 20,000 ppm males and females at the 15-month interim evaluation, and the incidences of squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma were significantly increased in exposed groups of males and females at 2 years. Chemical-related hyperplasia of forestomach epithelium was also present at 15 months and at 2 years. Alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were present only in the exposed groups of males and females at 15 months, and the incidences of alveolar/bronchiolar adenoma were significantly increased in exposed males and females at 2 years. The incidences of multiple alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas were also increased in exposed males. In the kidney, pigmentation was present in the renal tubules of most mice after 2 years of exposure. DISPOSITION AND METABOLISM STUDIES: Adult male F344/N rats were given [14C]-labeled 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone as a single intravenous dose of 0.4 mg/kg body weight or as a single oral dose of 2, 23, 118, 814, or 1,473 mg/kg. A 6-hour bile cannulation study was also performed. From day 0 through day 3 after intravenous administration, about 50&percnt; of the 14C was excreted in the feces, 15&percnt; in the urine, and 6&percnt; in expired air. Unmetabolized 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone accounted for less than 3&percnt; of the excreted 14C after intravenous administration. For oral doses administered, the amount of the dose that was absorbed fit the equation: absorbed dose = 6.6 x log(dose). After intravenous administration, the metabolites of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in blood were primarily in the plasma fraction (blood:plasma ratio of approximately 0.5:1). The highest concentrations of 14C in tissues 15 minutes after intravenous dosing were in excretory organs, lung, kidney, small intestine, liver, adipose tissue, and adrenal gland. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA1537 in the absence of S9; with S9, an equivocal response was observed in TA1537. 1-Amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone resulted in an equivocal response in TA100 with and without S9, and no mutagenic activity was detected with strain TA1535. In cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone induced sister chromatid exchanges with and without S9; chromosomal aberrations were induced in the absence of S9. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female F344/N rats based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, large intestine, kidney, and urinary bladder. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms in the liver, forestomach, and lung. Exposure of male and female rats to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 2 years was associated with basophilic focus (males only), clear cell focus, eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the liver; renal tubule hyperplasia, renal tubule pigmentation, and transitional cell hyperplasia in the kidney; transitional cell hyperplasia, squamous metaplasia, and stromal metaplasia (females only) in the urinary bladder; squamous hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, ulceration, and inflammation of the forestomach mucosa; and seminal vesicle atrophy. Exposure of male and female mice to 1-amino-2,4-dibromoanthraquinone for 2 years was associated with centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy (males only), basophilic focus, clear cell focus (females only), eosinophilic focus, and pigmentation in the liver; pigmentation in the kidney; and hyperplasia, basal cell hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and inflammation of the forestomach mucosa.

NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering glycidol (94% pure, containing 1.2% 3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol, 0.4% 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol, 2.8% diglycidyl ether, and 1.1% 2,6-dimethanol-1,4-dioxane) in water by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 16 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, Drosophila melanogaster, and the bone marrow of male B6C3F1 mice. Sixteen-Day Studies: Glycidol doses for groups of five rats or five mice of each sex ranged from 37.5 to 600 mg/kg; vehicle controls received distilled water. All rats that received 600 mg/kg died between days 3 and 13. Edema and degeneration of the epididymal stroma, atrophy of the testis, and granulomatous inflammation of the epididymis occurred in males that received 300 mg/kg. All mice that received 600 mg/kg and two males and two females that received 300 mg/kg died by day 4 of the studies. Focal demyelination in the medulla and thalamus of the brain occurred in all female mice that received 300 mg/kg. Thirteen-Week Studies: Doses for groups of 10 rats ranged from 25 to 400 mg/kg, and doses for groups of 10 mice ranged from 19 to 300 mg/kg; vehicle controls received distilled water. All rats that received 400 mg/kg died by week 2; three males and one female that received 200 mg/kg died during weeks 11-12. Final mean body weights of male rats that received 50, 100, or 200 mg/kg were 96%-85% that of vehicle controls; final mean body weights of female rats receiving the same doses were 95%-89% that of vehicle controls. Sperm count and sperm motility were reduced in male rats that received 100 or 200 mg/kg. Necrosis of the cerebellum, demyelineation in the medulla of the brain, tubular degeneration and/or necrosis of the kidney, lymphoid necrosis of the thymus, and testicular atrophy and/or degeneration occurred in rats that received 400 mg/kg. All mice that received 300 mg/kg died by week 2; deaths of mice that received 150 mg/kg occurred during weeks 4-8 for males and weeks 1-5 for females. Mean body weights of chemically exposed mice surviving to the end of the studies were generally 90%-94% those of vehicle controls. Sperm count and sperm motility were reduced in dosed male mice. Compound-related histopathologic lesions included demyelination of the brain in males and females that received 150 or 300 mg/kg, testicular atrophy in males at all doses, and renal tubular cell degeneration in male mice that received 300 mg/kg. Based on reduced survival, reduced weight gain, and histopathologic lesions in the brain and kidney in rats that received 200 or 400 mg/kg and on reduced survival and histopathologic lesions of the brain in mice that received 150 or 300 mg/kg, doses selected for the 2-year studies of glycidol were 37.5 and 75 mg/kg for rats and 25 and 50 mg/kg for mice. Body Weights and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of chemically exposed male rats generally ranged from 80% to 94% of those of vehicle controls, and mean body weights of chemically exposed female rats were from 90% to 97% those of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of chemically exposed male mice were similar to those of vehicle controls; mean body weights of chemically exposed female mice were 79%-95% of those of vehicle controls. Virtually all male and female rats that received glycidol died or were killed in a moribund condition as a result of the early induction of neoplastic disease (final survival--male: vehicle control, 16/50; low dose, 0/50; high dose, 0/50; female: 28/50; 4/50; 0/50). Survival of vehicle control male rats was lower than that usually observed; however, specific causes of deaths could not be determined. The survival of male mice and low dose female mice was similar to that of vehicle controls; survival of female mice that resurvival of male mice and low dose female mice was similar to that of vehicle controls; survival of female mice that received 50 mg/kg was lower than that of vehicle controls after week 101 (final survival--male: 33/50; 25/50; 27/50; female: 29/50; 27/50; 17/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Chemical-related nonneoplastic lesions in both rats and mice included hyperkeratosis and epithelial dysplasia of the forestomach. Fibrosis of the spleen was also present in rats of each sex, and cysts of the preputial gland and kidney were present in male mice. Exposure to glycidol induced dose-related increases in the incidences of neoplasms in numerous tissues in both rats and mice (see summary table on page 5 of the Technical Report). In male rats, mesotheliomas arising in the tunica vaginalis and frequently metastasizing to the peritoneum were considered the major cause of early death. Early deaths in female rats were associated with the presence of mammary gland neoplasms. Genetic Toxicology: Glycidol was mutagenic in a variety of in vitro and in vivo short-term tests. Mutagenic activity was observed in S. typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535, and TA1537 exposed to glycidol with and without exogenous metabolic activation. Glycidol was positive in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation in the mouse lymphoma assay for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in L5178Y/TK cells; it was not tested with activation. In cytogenetic tests with CHO cells, glycidol induced both sister chromatid exchanges and chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Glycidol induced sex-linked recessive lethal mutations and reciprocal translocations in the germ cells of male D. melanogaster exposed by feeding. The incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes was increased in the bone marrow of male B6C3F1 mice administered glycidol by intraperitoneal injection. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of glycidol for male F344/N rats, based on increased incidences of mesotheliomas of the tunica vaginalis; fibroadenomas of the mammary gland; gliomas of the brain; and neoplasms of the forestomach, intestine, skin, Zymbal gland, and thyroid gland. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female F344/N rats, based on increased incidences of fibroadenomas and adenocarcinomas of the mammary gland; gliomas of the brain; neoplasms of the oral mucosa, forestomach, clitoral gland, and thyroid gland; and leukemia. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland, forestomach, skin, liver, and lung. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice, based on increased incidences of neoplasms of the harderian gland, mammary gland, uterus, subcutaneous tissue, and skin. Other neoplasms that may have been related to the administration of glycidol were fibrosarcomas of the glandular stomach in female rats and carcinomas of the urinary bladder and sarcomas of the epididymis in male mice.

It is also an intermediate in the manufacture of rubber and food antioxidants and monomer inhibitors. Hydroquinone and products containing hydroquinone are used as depigmenting agents to lighten skin. NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis studies were conducted by administering hydroquinone (greater than 99% pure) in corn oil or water by gavage to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 14 days, 13 weeks, or 2 years. Additionally, genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma cells, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and Drosophila melanogaster. Preliminary 3-day dermal studies were conducted with rats and mice using sufficient hydroquinone in 95% ethanol to crystallize on the skin (4 or 40 mg per animal); conjugated metabolites of hydroquinone were detected in the urine. Fourteen-day dermal studies were conducted at doses up to 3,840 mg/kg for rats and 4,800 mg/kg for mice. No toxic effects were seen in the 3- or 14-day dermal studies. Therefore, in further evaluations of hydroquinone, the gavage route of administration was used. Results of Fourteen-Day and Thirteen-Week Studies: Fourteen-day gavage studies were conducted by administering hydroquinone in corn oil to rats at doses ranging from 63 to 1,000 mg/kg body weight and to mice at doses ranging from 31 to 500 mg/kg. All rats receiving 1,000 mg/kg and 1/5 male and 4/5 female rats receiving 500 mg/kg died before the end of the 14 days. Compound-related clinical signs in rats included tremors lasting up to 30 minutes after each dosing at 500 and 1,000 mg/kg. In the 14-day gavage studies with mice, 4/5 male mice and 5/5 female mice receiving 500 mg/kg and 3/5 males receiving 250 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. Tremors followed by convulsions were seen at 250 and 500 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies, doses for rats and mice ranged from 25 to 400 mg/kg. All rats receiving 400 mg/kg and 3/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg died before the end of the studies. The mean body weight at necropsy of male rats administered 100 or 200 mg/kg was about 8%-9% lower than that of vehicle controls. Mean body weights of vehicle control and dosed female rats at necropsy were similar. Tremors and convulsions were observed after dosing in most rats receiving 400 mg/kg and in several female rats receiving 200 mg/kg. Inflammation and/or epithelial hyperplasia (acanthosis) of the forestomach were seen in 4/10 male rats and 1/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg. Toxic nephropathy, characterized by tubular cell degeneration in the renal cortex, was seen in 7/10 male and 6/10 female rats receiving 200 mg/kg and in 1/10 females receiving 100 mg/kg. In the 13-week studies in mice, 8/10 males and 8/10 females receiving 400 mg/kg and 2/10 male mice receiving 200 mg/kg died early. Mean body weights of dosed and vehicle control mice at necropsy were similar. Liver weight to body weight ratios for dosed male mice were significantly greater than for vehicle controls. Ulceration, inflammation, or epithelial hyperplasia of the forestomach was found in 3/10 male and 2/10 female mice receiving 400 mg/kg and 1/10 females receiving 200 mg/kg. Based on these collective results, 2-year studies were conducted by administering 0, 25, or 50 mg/kg hydroquinone in deionized water by gavage to groups of 65 rats of each sex, 5 days per week. Groups of 65 mice of each sex were administered 0, 50, or 100 mg/kg on the same schedule. Ten rats and 10 mice from each group were killed after 15 months for an interim evaluation. Observations at Fifteen Months: In the rats killed at 15 months, the relative kidney weight for high dose male rats was greater than that for vehicle controls. The hematocrit value, hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte count for high dose female rats were decreased. Compound-related increased severity of nephropathy was observed in male rats. In mice killed at 15 months, the relative liver weights for high dose male and female mice were signif and female mice were significantly greater than those for vehicle controls. Lesions seen in the liver of male mice included increased syncytial cells and diffuse cytomegaly. Body Weights, Organ Weights, and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose male rats were 5&percnt;-13&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 73, and those of low dose male rats were 5&percnt;-9&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 89. Mean body weights of dosed female rats were similar to those of vehicle controls throughout the study. The relative kidney and liver weights for high dose male rats were higher than those for vehicle controls. Mean body weights of high dose male mice were 5&percnt;-8&percnt; lower than those of vehicle controls after week 93, and those of high dose female mice were 5&percnt;-14&percnt; lower after week 20. Relative liver weights were increased for dosed male and high dose female mice. No significant differences in survival were observed between any groups of rats or mice of either sex after 2 years (male rats: vehicle control, 27/55; low dose, 18/55; high dose, 18/55; female rats: 40/55; 27/55; 32/55; male mice: 33/55; 37/54; 36/55; female mice: 37/55; 39/55; 36/55). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: Nearly all male rats and most female rats in all vehicle control and dosed groups had nephropathy. The severity of this disease was judged to be greater in high dose male rats. Hyperplasia of the renal pelvic transitional epithelium and renal cortical cysts, changes observed with advanced renal disease, were increased in male rats. Renal tubular hyperplasia was seen in 2 high dose male rats, and renal tubular adenomas were seen in 4/55 low dose and 8/55 high dose male rats; none was seen in vehicle controls. Mononuclear cell leukemia in female rats occurred with a positive trend, and the incidences in the dosed groups were greater than that in the vehicle controls (vehicle control, 9/55; low dose, 15/55; high dose, 22/55). The historical incidence of leukemia in water gavage vehicle control female F344/N rats is 25&percnt; &plusmn; 15&percnt; and in untreated controls is 19&percnt; &plusmn; 7&percnt;. Compound-related lesions observed in the liver of high dose male mice included anisokaryosis (0/55; 2/54; 12/55), syncytial alteration (5/55; 3/54; 25/55), and basophilic foci (2/55; 5/54; 11/55). The incidences of hepatocellular adenomas were increased in dosed male mice (9/55; 21/54; 20/55), but these increases were offset by decreases in the incidences of hepatocellular carcinomas (13/55; 11/54; 7/55). The incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms, primarily adenomas, were increased in dosed female mice (3/55; 16/55; 13/55). Follicular cell hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was increased in dosed mice (male: 5/55; 15/53; 19/54; female: 13/55; 47/55; 45/55). Follicular cell adenomas were seen in 2/55 vehicle control, 1/53 low dose, and 2/54 high dose male mice and in 3/55 vehicle control, 5/55 low dose, and 6/55 high dose female mice, a follicular cell carcinoma was seen in a seventh high dose female mouse. The highest observed incidence of follicular cell adenomas or carcinomas(combined) in historical water gavage vehicle control female B6C3F1 mice is 3/48 (6&percnt;). Genetic Toxicology: Hydroquinone was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA1535, or TA1537 with or without exogenous metabolic activation. It induced trifluorothymidine (Tft) resistance in mouse L5178Y/TK lymphoma cells in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. An equivocal response was obtained in tests for induction of sex-linked recessive lethal mutations in Drosophila administered hydroquinone by feeding. Hydroquinone induced sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) in CHO cells both with or without exogenous metabolic activation and caused chromosomal aberrations in the presence of activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year gavage studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for male F344/N rats, as shown by marked increases in tubular cell adenomas of the kidney. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for female F344/N rats, as shown by increases in mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for male B6C3F1 mice administered 50 or 100 mg/kg in water by gavage. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of hydroquinone for female B6C3F1 mice, as shown by increases in hepatocellular neoplasms, mainly adenomas. Administration of hydroquinone was associated with thyroid follicular cell hyperplasia in both male and female mice and anisokaryosis, multinucleated hepatocytes, and basophilic foci of the liver in male mice.

NTP Toxicology and Carcinogenesis studies were conducted by feeding diets containing nalidixic acid (approximately 99% pure) to groups of F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice of each sex for 13 weeks or 2 years. Genetic toxicology studies were conducted in Salmonella typhimurium, mouse lymphoma cells, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Thirteen-Week Studies: Nalidixic acid was administered at dietary concentrations ranging from 1,000 to 16,000 ppm. One female rat that received 16,000 ppm nalidixic acid died before the end of the studies; no other compound-related deaths occurred in rats and mice. The final mean body weights of rats that received 8,000 or 16,000 ppm were 23% or 49% lower than those of controls for males and 11% or 31% lower for females. Feed consumption by rats receiving 16,000 ppm was approximately two-thirds that by controls. Liver weight to body weight ratios for male rats that received 2,000 ppm or more and female rats that received 8,000 ppm or more were significantly greater than those for controls. Degeneration of the germinal epithelium in the seminiferous tubules of the testis was observed in 10/10 male rats that received 16,000 ppm; no other compound-related histopathologic effects were observed in rats. The final mean body weights of mice that received 8,000 or 16,000 ppm were 10%-20% lower than those of controls. Feed consumption by dosed mice was similar to that by controls. Liver weight to body weight ratios were significantly greater for male mice receiving 2,000, 8,000, or 16,000 ppm and for female mice receiving 4,000, 8,000, or 16,000 ppm than for the controls. No compound-related histopathologic effects were observed in mice. Based on these results, 2-year studies of nalidixic acid were conducted by feeding diets containing 0, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm nalidixic acid to groups of 50 male and 50 female F344/N rats and 50 male and 50 female B6C3F1 mice. Body Weight and Survival in the Two-Year Studies: Mean body weights of high dose rats were 7%-23% lower than those of controls, and those of low dose male rats were 6%-11% lower than those of controls. The average daily feed consumption by dosed rats ranged from 89% to 96% that by controls. The average amount of nalidixic acid consumed per day was approximately 80 or 175 mg/kg for low dose or high dose rats. Mean body weights of high dose male mice were 1%-8% lower than those of controls throughout the study. Mean body weights of dosed female mice were 5%-17% lower than those of controls. Average daily feed consumption by dosed mice was within 3% of that by controls. The estimated average amount of nalidixic acid consumed per day was approximately 220 or 475 mg/kg for low dose or high dose mice. No significant differences in survival were seen between any groups of rats or mice of either sex after 2 years (male rats: control, 27/50; low dose, 28/50; high dose, 27/50; female rats: 22/50; 31/50; 29/50; male mice: 33/50; 34/50; 31/50; female mice: 40/50; 43/50; 32/50). Nonneoplastic and Neoplastic Effects in the Two-Year Studies: The incidences of preputial gland neoplasms in dosed male rats and of clitoral gland neoplasms in dosed female rats were significantly greater than those in controls (male--preputial gland adenomas, papillomas, or carcinomas, combined: control, 3/49; low dose, 19/49; high dose, 20/47; female--clitoral gland adenomas, papillomas, or carcinomas, combined: 5/46; 15/46; 16/47). A squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue was seen in two high dose male rats. The historical incidence of oral cavity neoplasms in untreated control male F344/N rats is 7/1,596 (0.4%). There were decreased incidences of leukemia (20/50; 9/50; 7/50) and mammary gland neoplasms (10/50; 7/50; 2/50) in dosed female rats and of pituitary gland neoplasms (11/49; 2/50; 2/50) in dosed male rats. Retinal degeneration and cataracts of the eye were observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (degeneration--male: 4/48; 41/48; 47/49; female: 2/47; 40/48; 46/50; cataracts--malee observed at increased incidences in dosed rats (degeneration--male: 4/48; 41/48; 47/49; female: 2/47; 40/48; 46/50; cataracts--male: 11/48; 23/48; 38/49; female: 0/47; 18/48; 14/50). The cause of these cataracts and retinal degeneration is uncertain because cages were not rotated and low and high dose groups of rats may have been exposed to greater light intensity than were the controls. Subcutanous tissue fibrosarcomas and fibromas or fibrosarcomas (combined) were increased in dosed male mice (fibromas or fibrosarcomas, combined: 5/50; 9/50; 14/50). There were no increased incidences of neoplasms in dosed female mice. Genetic Toxicology: Nalidixic acid was not mutagenic in any of several in vitro short-term tests. No gene reversion was observed in S. typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, or TA1535 after exposure to nalidixic acid in either the presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation. Results of tests for induction of trifluorothymidine resistance in mouse L5178Y/TK lymphoma cells were negative with or without metabolic activation. In CHO cells, nalidixic acid did not induce sister chromatid exchanges or chromosomal aberrations in either the presence or absence of activation. Conclusions: Under the conditions of these 2-year feed studies, there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of nalidixic acid for F344/N rats, as indicated by increased incidences of preputial gland neoplasms in males and clitoral gland neoplasms in females. There was equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity for male B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing nalidixic acid, as indicated by marginally increased incidences of subcutaneous tissue neoplasms. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity for female B6C3F1 mice fed diets containing 2,000 or 4,000 ppm nalidixic acid for 2 years.

A total of 14 patients (four males and 10 females; median age, 31.0 years) with severe dry eye associated with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) were enrolled in this study. All patients were refractory to treatment with conventional artificial tears. Autologous serum eye drops, a solution made of 20% autologous serum in sterile saline, were applied 10 times per eye per day. The patients were evaluated every 4 weeks according to visual acuity, corneal sensitivity, vital staining of the ocular surface, tear dynamics, and subjective assessments of symptoms (complaints scores). The median follow-up period was 19.4 months (range: 4-41 months). After 4 weeks of treatment, significant improvement was observed in both complaint scores (from 33.7+/-12.3 to 23.6+/-10.6 points; P<0.01) and fluorescein scores (from 5.8+/-2.0 to 2.4+/-0.9 points; P<0.005). Significant improvements were observed also in rose-bengal staining and tear break-up time. In seven of the 14 patients, the responses were maintained for 6-41 months (median:19.4+/-8.3 months), while six of the other seven patients required treatment with punctal plugs in addition to autologous serum eye drops. One of these other seven patients developed eczema around the eyelids, after which the treatment was discontinued. No serious adverse events were observed. We conclude that autologous serum eye drops are safe and effective for treating severe dry eye associated with cGVHD and that more efficient control of dry eye may be achieved by the combined use of autologous serum eye drops with punctal plugs.","['Ogawa, Y', 'Okamoto, S', 'Mori, T', 'Yamada, M', 'Mashima, Y', 'Watanabe, R', 'Kuwana, M', 'Tsubota, K', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Oguchi, Y']","['Ogawa Y', 'Okamoto S', 'Mori T', 'Yamada M', 'Mashima Y', 'Watanabe R', 'Kuwana M', 'Tsubota K', 'Ikeda Y', 'Oguchi Y']","['Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Proteins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Chronic Disease', 'Dry Eye Syndromes/*drug therapy/*etiology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Ophthalmic Solutions/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703862 [doi]', '1703862 [pii]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2003 Apr;31(7):579-83. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703862.,,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Ophthalmic Solutions)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 100 patients received 593 DLI between June 1990 and December 2000 in a bulk dose (n=14) or in escalating dose infusions (n=86). Patients were analyzed after stratification for type of relapse: (1). molecular relapse (n=6), (2). cytogenetic relapse (n=20), (3). chronic phase of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or complete remission of other disease post chemotherapy (n=24), (4). CML in accelerated/blastic phase (n=14), (5). resistant disease not responding to chemotherapy (n=36). The proportion of responders to DLI in these five groups was 100, 90, 75, 36 and 0% (P<0.0001).

Acute GvHD (grades II-IV) occurred in 21 patients (21%), and correlated in multivariate analysis with pancytopenia and less than four DLI. Other predictors of GvHD were the number of CD3+cells/infusion and serum levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase (gammaGT). The actuarial probability of treatment-related mortality was 9% for HLA identical siblings and 44% for alternative donor transplants (P=0.006).

The surprising success of allogeneic BMT may be because of disease response to high-dose chemotherapy combined with a graft-versus-leukemia effect. However, less than 30% of patients have a matched related donor available, and some of them will be too old/not fit for conventional BMT. While young patients who do not have a matched related donor should be considered for matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplant, older patients may be treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) or rarely considered for a low-intensity MUD transplant. The efficacy of autologous BMT compared with chemotherapy is still debatable, although the new tyrosine kinase inhibitor Imatinib may be used for pretransplant purging/post-transplant therapy, aiming to improve autologous and allogeneic BMT results. The advantage of low-intensity sib/MUD allograft compared with chemotherapy is not proven either and is currently under investigation.

Therefore, the removal of overlapping sequences between the vector and the packaging constructs is crucial for minimizing the possibility of homologous recombination, and therefore, the production of RCR. We have recently constructed a series of retroviral vectors that contain no viral coding sequences, but still produce high viral titer and high-level gene expression. However, many previously constructed murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based packaging constructs contained significantly long 5' and/or 3' untranslated regions of MLV, which are also present in the retroviral vector, and as such could possibly lead to homologous recombination. To make a retroviral production system that is free from homologous recombination, we constructed expression plasmids for gag-pol and env, precisely starting from the start codon and ending at the stop codon of respective open reading frames. When the packaging function was provided from one plasmid, a vector containing bits of all three viral coding sequences produced RCR at a significant frequency, while our vector remained free of any RCR. Our retrovirus production system is anticipated to have the minimum possible frequency of RCR production due to the elimination of potential sites for homologous recombination. Based on these results, a highly efficient new packaging line Vamp that contains no overlapping sequences with our retroviral vector was also developed.","['Yu, Seung Shin', 'Han, Eunyoung', 'Hong, Youngtae', 'Lee, Jun-Tae', 'Kim, Sujeong', 'Kim, Sunyoung']","['Yu SS', 'Han E', 'Hong Y', 'Lee JT', 'Kim S', 'Kim S']","['ViroMedCo.

In total, 15 consecutive patients with nonmature ALL were enrolled on a prospective phase II study. No exclusion was made because of older age, poor performance status and organ dysfunctions.

We have examined a cohort of 91 patients, AML (80) and MDS (11), to determine the prevalence of these mutations and any correlations between the two mutations and disease prognosis. FLT3/ITD (ITD+) or D835 mutations (D835+) were not detected in MDS patients examined. However, 10% (8/80) and 7.5% (6/80) of AML patients were ITD+ and D835+, respectively. ITD+ patients have a higher rate of relapse than patients with wild-type (WT) FLT3. Median overall survival was 4.6 months (range 0.6-36.2) for ITD+ and 19.85 months (range 0.2-197.5) for WT patients (P=0.0066), and disease-free survival (DFS) was also worse for ITD+ patients than FLT3/WT patients (P=0.047). FLT3/ITD is also a significant prognostic marker for overall survival (OS) and DFS in patients in the standard karyotype group (P=0.0040, 0.0365, respectively). ITD is more prevalent in patients in the standard karyotype category (7/41, 17.1%) as compared to patients in the poor-risk category (1/32, 3.1%). Similar to ITD, D835 mutations were found to be more frequent in patients with standard-risk rather than poor-risk cytogenetic category. WBC count (mean 63.8 x 10(9)/l) was significantly higher in ITD+ patients than patients with D835 mutations (mean 34.8 x 10(9)/l) and WT patients (mean 26.4 x 10(9)/l) (P=0.004). D835 mutants did not appear to have a worse median OS or DFS compared with the WT group.

Recent studies reported N- and C-terminal CEBPA mutations in approximately 7% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. C-terminal mutations are usually in-frame and occur in the basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) domain, resulting in deficient DNA binding. Using a rapid PCR approach, we screened for bZIP mutations and determined the prognostic value of these mutations in a cohort of 277 de novo AMLs. In addition, we set out to quantify CEBPA mRNA levels by 'real-time' PCR using TaqMan technology. In-frame insertions were observed in 12 (4.3%) cases. All cases with mutations carried an intermediate-risk karyotype and all but one belonged to M1 or M2 FAB class. Further sequence analysis revealed that CEBPA C-terminal mutations are associated with frameshift mutations in the N-terminus of CEBPA. These two mutations were always found in different alleles. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with CEBPA mutations were significantly increased (P=0.02 and 0.03, respectively) in comparison to the patients lacking these mutations. Mutations were associated with a significantly reduced hazard ratio for death (OS: HR=0.35, P=0.04) and failure (EFS: no CR, death in CR or relapse, HR=0.37, P=0.03). This favourable hazard ratio was maintained after adjustment for cytogenetic risk, FLT3-ITD and CEBPA expression levels in multivariable analysis. In contrast, low CEBPA expression in AML with intermediate-risk karyotype (n=6) seemed to be associated with poor prognosis (not significant).

We have previously demonstrated that non-specific esterases from normal monocytes can be determined by a chemiluminescent method. In the present study, we investigated whether this assay can also determine the monocytic component of FAB-M4 and FAB-M5 and distinguish these acute myeloid leukemia (AML) categories. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow samples were obtained from 66 patients with AML (M0, two cases; M1, 12 cases; M2, 13 cases; M3, 10 cases; M4, 11 cases; M5, 12 cases; M6, two cases; M7, four cases). Cells were incubated with a standard reaction mixture and chemiluminescence was measured for 10 min. Two parameters were assessed, the peak (PLE) and the integrated light emission (ILE). RESULTS: Both PLE and ILE were higher in FAB-M4 and FAB-M5 subtypes compared to other AML subtypes (P<0.001). In addition, the classification of AML cases into FAB-M4, FAB-M5 and nonmonocytic subtypes based on ILE analysis was concordant with alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (ANAE) in 97% of cases (kappa coefficient 0.94, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that this chemiluminescent assay was able to determine the monocytic component of FAB-M4 and FAB-M5 cells, and the classification of AML subtypes based on chemiluminescent analysis strongly agreed with the cytochemical ANAE-staining. In conclusion, this chemiluminescent assay is a simple, fast and objective method, which may be useful as an alternative tool in the differential diagnosis of AML subtypes.","['da Fonseca, Luiz M', 'Brunetti, Iguatemy L', 'Campa, Ana', 'Catalani, Luiz H', 'Calado, Rodrigo T', 'Falcao, Roberto P']","['da Fonseca LM', 'Brunetti IL', 'Campa A', 'Catalani LH', 'Calado RT', 'Falcao RP']","['Department of Clinical Analysis, State University of Sao Paulo School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Araraquara, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Benzoates/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cryopreservation', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Horseradish Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/diagnosis/enzymology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/diagnosis/enzymology/*pathology', '*Luminescent Measurements', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Sodium Fluoride/pharmacology']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200209 [doi]', '6200209 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(1):26-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200209.,,"['0 (2-methyl-1-propenylbenzoate)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Horseradish Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, however, unknown whether the CD57+ population represents the LGL clone or not. We previously demonstrated that the clone can be found in both CD8+CD57+ and CD8+CD57- cells, indicating that the LGL clone also resides in the CD57- fraction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here, we quantified the extent of the clonal CD8 expansion in LGL using T-cell receptor Vbeta (TCRBV)-specific monoclonal antibodies, and determined whether the CD4 population also contained skews. Furthermore, dominant TCRBV populations were assessed for clonal status using T-cell receptor-gamma (TCRG) PCR on genomic DNA. RESULTS: We show that the dominant TCRBV in LGL contains CD57+ and CD57- cells. Molecular analysis of CD8+CD57+ and CD8+CD57- subfractions of the dominant TCRBV by TCRG PCR demonstrates that indeed both fractions are clonal, and that the clone is absent from the dominant TCRBV-negative population. Furthermore, we show that CD57 overexpression is not restricted to the LGL clone, but a general phenomenon in CD8 cells of LGL patients. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that the primary characteristic of LGL is a clonal expansion of CD8 cells, with a concomitant upregulation of CD57 on this clone and uninvolved cells.","['Melenhorst, J Joseph', 'Eniafe, Rhoda', 'Follmann, Dean', 'Molldrem, Jeffrey', 'Kirby, Martha', 'El Ouriaghli, Frank', 'Barrett, A John']","['Melenhorst JJ', 'Eniafe R', 'Follmann D', 'Molldrem J', 'Kirby M', 'El Ouriaghli F', 'Barrett AJ']","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, NHLBI, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. melenhoj@nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol J,The hematology journal : the official journal of the European Haematology Association,100965523,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Autoimmune Diseases/immunology/pathology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry', 'CD57 Antigens/analysis', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*pathology', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/chemistry']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/07/18 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.thj.6200212 [doi]', '6200212 [pii]']",ppublish,Hematol J. 2003;4(1):18-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.thj.6200212.,,"['0 (CD57 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Significant risk factors for HC by univariate analysis included diagnosis of chronic myelogenous leukemia (p=0.028), unrelated HCT (p=0.029), grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (p<0.001), extensive chronic GVHD (p=0.001), and positive cytomegalovirus antigenemia between post transplant days 31 and 60 (p=0.031). Multivariate analysis showed that grade III-IV acute GVHD was the most important risk factor for the occurrence of HC after allo-HCT (odds ratio, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.36-8.39). Late-onset HC, which occurred beyond 3 weeks after allo-HCT, was more frequently associated with GVHD than early-onset HC (p=0.007). Our data suggest that a portion of late-onset HC might be a manifestation of GVHD.","['Lee, Gyeong-Won', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Choi, Seong-Jun', 'Kim, Shin', 'Seol, Miee', 'Kim, Woo-Kun', 'Lee, Jung-Shin', 'Lee, Kyoo-Hyung']","['Lee GW', 'Lee JH', 'Choi SJ', 'Kim S', 'Seol M', 'Kim WK', 'Lee JS', 'Lee KH']","['Department of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea. jhlee3@www.amc.seoul.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,"['Adult', 'Cystitis/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/complications/pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Hemorrhagic Disorders/epidemiology/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Transplantation Conditioning']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2004/03/19 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['200304191 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2003.18.2.191 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2003 Apr;18(2):191-5. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2003.18.2.191.,,,,PMC3055015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate the efficacy of AS-ODNs as purging agents in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, K562 cells, a human CML cell line, were treated in vitro with various types of AS-ODNs and interferon-alpha. Cells were treated in vitro for 0 and 36 hr with 40 microgram/mL of AS-ODNs, respectively, and incubated at 37 degrees C for 36 hr. Cytotoxic effects were measured by counting the number of viable cells as well as by MTT test. Clonogenic activities were evaluated by methylcellulose culture for 2 weeks. The effects of purging agents on the rearrangement of bcrabl gene were evaluated by RT-PCR. AS-ODNs inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells with time in cell count assay and MTT test. AS-ODNs were superior to INF-alpha in inhibiting clonogenic activity (recovery rate; 26.3% vs 64.0%). After incubation with bcr-abl AS-ODNs primers and mRNA isolated from K562 cells, positive bands were abolished, especially of b3a2 type and phosphorothioate type.

Therefore, bovine cDNAs (boAP3delta) that are highly homologous to the candidate gene were cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences suggested that the boAP3delta cDNA encodes the delta subunit of boAP3 without transmembrane domains. Part of the AP3delta cDNA isolated from the lymph node, spleen and MDBK cells, from which the BLVR candidate cDNA was derived, has almost the same nucleotide sequences as the boAP3delta cDNA. A boAP3delta protein tagged with green fluorescent protein was localized in the cytoplasm and incorporated into AP-3 in bovine cells. Unlike the previous report about the candidate gene, the boAP3delta gene introduced into murine NIH 3T3 cells did not increase the susceptibility of the cells to BLV infection.

It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that this does not give an accurate or complete picture of the effects of most environmental exposures, which tend to be of low dose and protracted over time. We have initiated direct studies of low dose exposures, and using the relatively responsive ML-1 cell line, have shown that changes in gene expression can be triggered by doses of gamma-rays of 10 cGy and less in human cells. We have now extended these studies to investigate the effects on gene induction of reducing the rate of irradiation. In the ML-1 human myeloid leukemia cell line, we have found that reducing the dose rate over three orders of magnitude results in some protection against the induction of apoptosis, but still causes linear induction of the p53-regulated genes CDKN1A, GADD45A, and MDM2 between 2 and 50 cGy. Reducing the rate of exposure reduces the magnitude of induction of CDKN1A and GADD45A, but not the magnitude or duration of cell cycle delay. In contrast, MDM2 is induced to the same extent regardless of the rate of dose delivery. Microarray analysis has identified additional low dose-rate-inducible genes, and indicates the existence of two general classes of low dose-rate responders in ML-1. One group of genes is induced in a dose rate-dependent fashion, similar to GADD45A and CDKN1A. Functional annotation of this gene cluster indicates a preponderance of genes with known roles in apoptosis regulation. Similarly, a group of genes with dose rate-independent induction, such as seen for MDM2, was also identified. The majority of genes in this group are involved in cell cycle regulation. This apparent differential regulation of stress signaling pathways and outcomes in response to protracted radiation exposure has implications for carcinogenesis and risk assessment, and could not have been predicted from classical high dose studies.","['Amundson, Sally A', 'Lee, Richard Anthony', 'Koch-Paiz, Christine A', 'Bittner, Michael L', 'Meltzer, Paul', 'Trent, Jeffrey M', 'Fornace, Albert J Jr']","['Amundson SA', 'Lee RA', 'Koch-Paiz CA', 'Bittner ML', 'Meltzer P', 'Trent JM', 'Fornace AJ Jr']","['Division of Basic Science, National Cancer Institute and National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. amundson@box-a.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cancer Res,Molecular cancer research : MCR,101150042,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/radiation effects', 'Cell Cycle/genetics/radiation effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', '*Gamma Rays', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2004/04/16 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;1(6):445-52.,,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (GADD45A protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both proteins facilitate efficient viral DNA replication, late protein expression, and prevention of concatenation of viral genomes. Additionally, E4 ORF6 is involved in the shutoff of the host cell protein synthesis through its interaction with the E1B 55K protein. This complex also leads to the degradation of p53. A unique function of E4 ORF3 is the reorganization of nuclear structures known as PML oncogenic domains (PODs). The function of these domains is unclear, but PODs have been implicated in a number of important cellular processes, including transcriptional regulation, apoptosis, transformation, and response to interferon. The goal of this study was to determine the functional significance of the reorganization of PODs by E4 ORF3. Point mutations were made in the E4 ORF3 gene. These mutants were recombined into a virus lacking E4 ORF6 and expressed under the control of the natural virus E4 promoter. The panel of mutant viruses was used to investigate the role of E4 ORF3 during the course of the viral infection program. One of the mutant viruses exhibited aberrant reorganization of PODs and had a severe defect in viral DNA replication, thus leading to a dramatic decrease in virus production. A number of mutants accumulated viral DNA and infectious virus particles to wild-type levels but showed significant viral genome concatenation. These data show that E4 ORF3 is a multifunctional protein and that a specific rearrangement of nuclear PML domains is coupled to efficient viral DNA replication. This function is distinct from the role of E4 ORF3 in the regulation of virus genome concatenation via inhibition of cellular double-strand break repair.","['Evans, Jared D', 'Hearing, Patrick']","['Evans JD', 'Hearing P']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, New York 11794-5222, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Adenovirus E4 Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adenoviruses, Human/*genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus Structures', '*DNA Replication', 'DNA, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', '*Genome, Viral', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Point Mutation']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.9.5295-5304.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(9):5295-304. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.9.5295-5304.2003.,"['P01 CA028146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Adenovirus E4 Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)']",,PMC153982,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This model is very useful for investigating the mechanism of tumorigenesis and malignant cell growth of adult T-cell leukemia (ATL)/lymphoma, which still remains unclear. Nine HTLV-1-infected cell lines were inoculated subcutaneously in the postauricular region of NOG mice. As early as 2 to 3 weeks after inoculation, seven cell lines produced a visible tumor while two transformed cell lines failed to do so. Five of seven lines produced a progressively growing large tumor with leukemic infiltration of the cells in various organs that eventually killed the animals. Leukemic cell lines formed soft tumors, whereas some transformed cell lines developed into hemorrhagic hard tumors in NOG mice. One of the leukemic cell lines, ED-40515(-), was unable to produce visible tumors in NOD-SCID mice with a common gamma-chain after 2 weeks. In vivo NF-kappaB DNA binding activity of the ED-40515(-) cell line was higher and the NF-kappaB components were changed compared to cells in vitro.

For Moloney murine leukemia virus, primer removal at the RNA/DNA junction leaves the 3' terminus of the plus-strand primer abutting the downstream plus-strand DNA, but this 3' terminus is not efficiently reutilized for another round of extension. The RNase H cleavage to create the plus-strand primer might similarly result in the 3' terminus of this primer abutting downstream RNA, yet efficient initiation must occur to synthesize the plus-strand DNA. We hypothesized that displacement synthesis, RNase H activity, or both must participate to initiate plus-strand DNA synthesis. Using model hybrid substrates and RNase H-deficient reverse transcriptases, we found that displacement synthesis alone did not efficiently extend the plus-strand primer at a nick with downstream RNA. However, specific cleavage sites for RNase H were identified in the sequence immediately following the 3' end of the plus-strand primer. During generation of the plus-strand primer, cleavage at these sites generated a gap. When representative gaps separated the 3' terminus of the plus-strand primer from downstream RNA, primer extension significantly improved. The contribution of RNase H to the initiation of plus-strand DNA synthesis was confirmed by comparing the effects of downstream RNA versus DNA on plus-strand primer extension by wild-type reverse transcriptase. These data suggest a model in which efficient initiation of plus-strand synthesis requires the generation of a gap immediately following the plus-strand primer 3' terminus.","['Schultz, Sharon J', 'Zhang, Miaohua', 'Champoux, James J']","['Schultz SJ', 'Zhang M', 'Champoux JJ']","['Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195-7242, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA', 'RNA, Viral/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/*metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.9.5275-5285.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(9):5275-85. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.9.5275-5285.2003.,"['R01 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA051605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,PMC153992,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary target of PVC-211 MuLV infection in the brain is the brain capillary endothelial cell (BCEC), which is resistant to F-MuLV infection. Previous studies have shown that changes in the envelope gene of PVC-211 MuLV confer BCEC tropism to the virus. However, little is known about how infection of BCECs by PVC-211 MuLV induces neurological disease. Previous results suggest that nitric oxide (NO), which has been implicated as a potential neurotoxin, is involved in PVC-211 MuLV-induced neurodegeneration. In this study, we show that expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), which produces NO from L-arginine, is induced in BCECs from PVC-211 MuLV-infected rats. Furthermore, elevated levels of a 32-kDa cellular protein modified by 3-nitrotyrosine, which is a hallmark of NO production, were observed in virus-infected BCECs. BCECs from rats infected with BCEC-tropic but nonneuropathogenic PVF-e5 MuLV, which is a chimeric virus between PVC-211 MuLV and F-MuLV, fail to induce either iNOS expression or elevation of tyrosine nitration of a 32-kDa protein. These results suggest that expression of iNOS and nitration of tyrosine residues of a 32-kDa protein in PVC-211 MuLV-infected BCECs may play an important role in neurological disease induction.","['Jinno-Oue, Atsushi', 'Wilt, Susan G', 'Hanson, Charlotte', 'Dugger, Natalie V', 'Hoffman, Paul M', 'Masuda, Michiaki', 'Ruscetti, Sandra K']","['Jinno-Oue A', 'Wilt SG', 'Hanson C', 'Dugger NV', 'Hoffman PM', 'Masuda M', 'Ruscetti SK']","['Basic Research Laboratory, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Brain/*blood supply/enzymology/metabolism/virology', 'Capillaries/virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/enzymology/metabolism/*virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Nervous System/pathology/virology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*biosynthesis', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/physiopathology/virology', 'Tyrosine/*analogs & derivatives/*metabolism']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.9.5145-5151.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(9):5145-51. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.9.5145-5151.2003.,,"['0 (Proteins)', '3604-79-3 (3-nitrotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, rat)']",,PMC153958,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, M. spicilegus neonates were inoculated with Moloney ecotropic MLV (MoMLV). All 17 inoculated mice produced infectious ecotropic virus after 8 to 14 weeks, and two unusual phenotypes distinguished the isolates from MoMLV. First, most of the M. spicilegus isolates grew to equal titers on M. dunni and SC-1 cells, although MoMLV does not efficiently infect M. dunni cells. The deduced amino acid sequence of a representative clone differed from MoMLV by insertion of two serine residues within the VRA of SUenv. Modification of a molecular clone of MoMLV by the addition of these serines produced a virus that grows to high titer in M. dunni cells, establishing a role for these two serine residues in host range. A second unusual phenotype was found in only one of the M. spicilegus isolates, Spl574. Spl574 produces large syncytia of multinucleated giant cells in M. dunni cells, but its replication is restricted in other mouse cell lines. Sequencing and mutagenesis demonstrated that syncytium formation could be attributed to a single amino acid substitution within VRA, S82F. Thus, viruses with altered growth properties are selected during growth in M. spicilegus. The mutations associated with the host range and syncytium-inducing variants map to a key region of VRA known to govern interactions with the cell surface receptor, suggesting that the associated phenotypes may result from altered interactions with the unusual ecotropic virus mCAT1 receptor carried by M. dunni.","['Jung, Yong Tae', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Jung YT', 'Kozak CA']","['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-0460, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/classification/*genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Muridae/*virology', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Infections/virology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Tumor Virus Infections/virology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/28 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/28 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.9.5065-5072.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 May;77(9):5065-72. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.9.5065-5072.2003.,,"['0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,PMC153962,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Family history of cancer might interact with environmental exposures to produce associations that are otherwise difficult to detect. In addition to family history of leukemia or other hematopoietic cancers, family history of breast cancer could be a marker of susceptibility, because leukemia and breast cancer are known to cluster in families that have specific germ-line mutations. In a population-based case control study of 779 incident adult acute leukemia patients and 625 controls, we estimated the relative risk for exposed individuals with a family history compared with unexposed individuals without a family history (RR(11)), along with a measure of interdependence, the interaction contrast ratio. Combined with a family history of breast cancer, ever-smoking [RR(11) = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-4.8], general solvent exposure (RR(11) = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1-3.4), aromatic hydrocarbon exposure (RR(11) = 3.8, 95% CI: 1.1-14), and diagnostic ionizing radiation exposure (RR(11) = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2-3.8) were all associated with increased incidence. Furthermore, there was no increased incidence associated with any of these exposures in the absence of a family history of breast cancer and no increased incidence for family history of breast cancer in the absence of exposures. The pattern of relative risks strongly suggested synergy across exposures. Family history of breast cancer might be a marker of susceptibility to a range of leukemia risk factors, whose effects are generally weak or nonexistent when considered alone.","['Rauscher, Garth H', 'Sandler, Dale P', 'Poole, Charles', 'Pankow, James', 'Shore, David', 'Bloomfield, Clara D', 'Olshan, Andrew F']","['Rauscher GH', 'Sandler DP', 'Poole C', 'Pankow J', 'Shore D', 'Bloomfield CD', 'Olshan AF']","['Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60612, USA. garthr@uic.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Air Pollutants/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms, Male/epidemiology/etiology', 'Canada', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Family Health', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocarbons, Aromatic/adverse effects', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology/genetics', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Solvents/adverse effects', 'Statistics as Topic', 'United States']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2003 Apr;12(4):289-94.,"['CA09330-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57699-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Air Pollutants)', '0 (Hydrocarbons, Aromatic)', '0 (Solvents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To characterize factors important for colonic homeostasis and its dysregulation, human fetal colonic epithelial cells were isolated and seeded on a collagen type I matrix with embedded colonic fibroblasts. The epithelial cells rapidly spread from clusters and proliferated, and within 3 days, a columnar layer of polarized epithelium surrounded the surface of the constricted collagen matrix. The polarized enterocytes developed brush borders, tight junctions and desmosomes, and goblet and enteroendocrine cells were present. A balance of growth and differentiation was maintained for several weeks in the presence of collagen-embedded fibroblasts and a complex mixture of growth factors. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was critical for proliferation of enterocytes and inhibited expression of the differentiation marker carbonic anhydrase II. In the presence of LIF, the relative number of goblet cells remained stable, whereas enteroendocrine relative cell number declined. LIF-stimulated epithelial cells remained dependent on the presence of fibroblasts in the matrix. In combination with stem cell factor and endothelin 3, LIF induced formation of disorganized structures of stratified and semi-stratified cells, suggesting that the homeostatic balance in the normal human colon requires cooperation with differentiation-inducing factors.","['Kalabis, Jiri', 'Patterson, Michael J', 'Enders, Greg H', 'Marian, Brigitte', 'Iozzo, Renato V', 'Rogler, Gerhard', 'Gimotty, Phyllis A', 'Herlyn, Meenhard']","['Kalabis J', 'Patterson MJ', 'Enders GH', 'Marian B', 'Iozzo RV', 'Rogler G', 'Gimotty PA', 'Herlyn M']","['The Wistar Institute, 3601 Spruce St., Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,IM,"['Carbonic Anhydrase II/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Collagen Type I', 'Colon/anatomy & histology/*cytology/embryology', 'Enterocytes/enzymology', 'Epithelial Cells/cytology/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Models, Biological', 'Organ Culture Techniques/*methods']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1096/fj.02-0852fje [doi]', '02-0852fje [pii]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 2003 Jun;17(9):1115-7. doi: 10.1096/fj.02-0852fje.

METHODS: To investigate the effect of etoposide-induced apoptosis by PPARgamma ligands, leukemia cell lines were treated with troglitazone and 15-deoxy-Delta12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) in the presence of etoposide and studied about various biological responses. RESULTS: We found the enhancement of etoposide-induced apoptosis by PPARgamma ligands in several leukemia cell lines, which was dependent on the expression of PPARgamma and specific for TopoIIalpha inhibitor. We also observed the increased expression of TopoIIalpha protein by 15d-PGJ2 in Jurkat and HUVEC cells, which might lead to the increased sensitivity to etoposide. Furthermore, we demonstrated that 15d-PGJ2 enhanced the promoter activity of human TopoIIalpha promoter construct with a DR1-like site by sevenfold when expressed with PPARgamma and RXRalpha. The mutation of DR1-like site decreased the promoter activity, although the direct binding between DR1-like site and PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer was not demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the induction of TopoIIalpha expression by PPARgamma ligands via DR1-like site is an important mechanism for the enhancement of etoposide-induced apoptosis and a DR1-like site in TopoIIalpha promoter is involved in transcriptional regulation dependent on PPARgamma ligands and PPARgamma/RXRalpha heterodimer.","['Kanbe, Eiki', 'Abe, Akihiro', 'Towatari, Masayuki', 'Kawabe, Tsutomu', 'Saito, Hidehiko', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Kanbe E', 'Abe A', 'Towatari M', 'Kawabe T', 'Saito H', 'Emi N']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan. ekanbe@tsuru.med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Chromans/pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia', 'Ligands', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Prostaglandin D2/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', '*Thiazolidinediones', 'Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Troglitazone', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X03000031 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00003-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Apr;31(4):300-8. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(03)00003-1.,,"['0 (15-deoxy-delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J2)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Thiazolidinediones)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (down-regulator of transcription 1)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'I66ZZ0ZN0E (Troglitazone)', 'RXY07S6CZ2 (Prostaglandin D2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DSB can either be properly repaired, restoring genomic integrity, or misrepaired resulting in drastic consequences, such as cell death, genomic instability, and cancer. It is well established that exposure to DSB-inducing agents is associated with chromosomal abnormalities and leukemogenesis. The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is considered a major route for the repair DSB in mammalian cells. Although the mechanism(s) by which repair of DSB lead to leukemia are poorly understood, recent evidence is beginning to emerge that a poorly defined and error-prone branch of the NHEJ pathway plays a pivotal role in this process.

Here we describe heat-directed targeting of an activated form of the Gibbon ape leukemia virus env protein (GALV FMG) to tumor cells. GALV FMG mediates cell-cell fusion, and when expressed in tumor cells can produce bystander effects of up to 1:200. Transient transfection of a HSE70b.GALV FMG minigene caused extensive syncytia formation in HeLa and HT-1080 cells following mild heat treatment (44 degrees C/30 min). Stable transfection into HT-1080 cells produced a cell line (HG5) that exhibits massive syncytia formation and a 60% reduction in viability relative to a vector-only control (CI1) following heat treatment in vitro. Mild hyperthermia also resulted in syncytia formation, necrosis, and complete macroscopic regression of HG5 xenograft tumors grown in the footpads of mice with severe combined immunodeficiency disorders (SCID). Median survival increased from 12.5 (in heated CI1 controls) to 52 days after a single heat treatment.

Inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis are the major mechanisms of cytotoxic agents to cause tumor cell death. Therefore, we studied whether Ara-C in combination with the purine analogues exerts synergistic or antagonistic effects on cell proliferation, phosphatidylserine exposure and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in the AML cell lines HL60 and HEL. Furthermore, effects of the combination of Ara-C with bendamustine, a new bifunctional agent with alkylating activity and a purine nucleus, was investigated. Assessment by combination index analysis showed that Ara-C combined with fludarabine or bendamustine exhibited additive to antagonistic effects on inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis as well as on disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, independent of a simultaneous or consecutive (purine analogues before Ara-C) incubation schedule. In contrast, the combination of Ara-C with 2-CdA exclusively yielded synergistic effects. While inducing IC50 levels of apoptosis neither the antagonistic nor the synergistic drug combinations caused a specific expression pattern of apoptosis-associated proteins such as the pro- or antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, executioner caspases, IAPs (inhibitor of apoptosis proteins), proapoptotic Par-4, PARP, or p53. In conclusion, we here demonstrate that the in vitro efficacy of drug combinations containing Ara-C and purine analogues depends on the purine analogue applied, whereas incubation schedules or escalating dosages do not contribute to the synergistic effects.","['Chow, Kai U', 'Boehrer, Simone', 'Napieralski, Simone', 'Nowak, Daniel', 'Knau, Andrea', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Mitrou, Paris S', 'Weidmann, Eckhart']","['Chow KU', 'Boehrer S', 'Napieralski S', 'Nowak D', 'Knau A', 'Hoelzer D', 'Mitrou PS', 'Weidmann E']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Hematology and Oncology, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60590 Franfurt/Main, Germany. chow@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Purines/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000054670 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):165-73. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000054670.,,"['0 (Purines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, high MRP activity did not influence treatment outcome in either T- or B-lineage ALL. Multivariate Cox regression analysis, showed P-gp activity to be the only unfavourable prognostic factor for overall survival in T-ALL. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the prognostic relevance of P-gp activity in T-ALL. Since the majority of the patients with high P-gp activity were adults, P-gp might contribute to the poor prognosis of adult T-ALL.","['Plasschaert, Sabine L A', 'Vellenga, Edo', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M', 'van der Kolk, Dorina M', 'Veerman, Anjo J P', 'Sluiter, Wim J', 'Daenen, Simon M G', 'de Vries, Elisabeth G E', 'Kamps, Willem A']","['Plasschaert SL', 'Vellenga E', 'de Bont ES', 'van der Kolk DM', 'Veerman AJ', 'Sluiter WJ', 'Daenen SM', 'de Vries EG', 'Kamps WA']","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Male', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000040288 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):85-95. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000040288.,,"['0 (ABCC2 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Protein 2)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1YV0492L5Z (multidrug resistance-associated protein 3)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to define incidence and calculate health care cost associated with HU and TLS. 788 acute leukaemia and NHL patients from Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain and UK were screened retrospectively for HU and TLS. Resource use related to HU and TLS was recorded and costs were calculated applying local unit costs. Results showed that HU occurred in 18.9% of patients, and 27.8% of them fulfilled TLS criteria. The cost of HU without TLS was 672 euros (SE 181), the cost of TLS 7,342 euros (SE 1,412). TLS requiring dialysis incurred an average cost of 17,706 euros. In conclusion, it is noted that the observed incidence rates were lower than earlier reports. In addition, some risk factors for HU and TLS (e.g. paediatric patients versus adults) were not associated with increased rates of HU or TLS as a consequence of higher rates of prevention. TLS cases incurred 11 times higher costs than HU cases in which TLS was absent. The main cost drivers in TLS are interventions requiring intensive care.","['Annemans, L', 'Moeremans, K', 'Lamotte, M', 'Garcia Conde, J', 'van den Berg, Henk', 'Myint, H', 'Pieters, R', 'Uyttebroeck, A']","['Annemans L', 'Moeremans K', 'Lamotte M', 'Garcia Conde J', 'van den Berg H', 'Myint H', 'Pieters R', 'Uyttebroeck A']","['Health Economics and Disease Management, Brusselsesteenweg 91, 1860 Meise, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Disease Management', '*Health Care Costs', 'Health Resources/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*economics/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Renal Dialysis/economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors', 'Spain/epidemiology', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*economics/*epidemiology/etiology', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000054661 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):77-83. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000054661.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A descriptive and prognostic clinicopathologic study of 29 cases.,59-69,"Large series of patients with Sezary syndrome (SS), the leukemic variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), have been reported infrequently because of its low incidence. Here we recorded several clinical, histopathological and immunophenotypical features of 29 cases of leukemic CTCL patients from four Dermatology Departments of Catalonia, Spain, and analyzed their prognostic value. Clinical data included sex, age, delay of SS diagnosis, previous diagnosis of lymphoma, B-symptoms, type of skin lesions, peripheral adenopathy, histologic evaluation of lymph node biopsy, visceral involvement, percentage of circulating Sezary cells, serum LDH and beta-2-microglobulin levels, first treatment and response, disease-free interval, further therapies and survival. Histopathological data examined were epidermotropism, depth and thickness of the infiltrate, cell size, adnexal involvement, presence of granuloma, eosinophils and plasma cells, mitotic rate. The percentage of CD45Ro, CD43, CD20, CD30 and CD8 positive dermal cells were also recorded. Survival showed a mean actuarial risk of 57% at 3 years and 38% at 5 years, with a median survival of 48 months. Analysis of actuarial survival demonstrated as following as features linked with a bad prognosis: fast evolution of the disease (from symptoms onset up to diagnosis) (p = 0.0274) raised levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase (p = 0.0379) and beta-2-microglobulin (p = 0.0151), the latter being the most important prognostic factor. In conclusion although SS had been traditionally considered as a low-grade lymphoma, the present study agrees with the recent classification rating SS as an aggressive type of CTCL with a poor prognosis. Our results show that some simple clinical and blood test data can be useful as prognostic indicators in this disease.","['Marti, R M', 'Pujol, R M', 'Servitje, O', 'Palou, J', 'Romagosa, V', 'Bordes, R', 'Gonzalez-Castro, J', 'Miralles, J', 'Gallardo, F', 'Curco, N', 'Gomez, X', 'Domingo, A', 'Estrach, T']","['Marti RM', 'Pujol RM', 'Servitje O', 'Palou J', 'Romagosa V', 'Bordes R', 'Gonzalez-Castro J', 'Miralles J', 'Gallardo F', 'Curco N', 'Gomez X', 'Domingo A', 'Estrach T']","['Department of Dermatology, Hospital Clinic, Villarroel 170.08036 Barcelona, Spain. rmarti@clinic.ub.es']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Size', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Sezary Syndrome/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Skin/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000054652 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):59-69. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000054652.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We collected 53 cases: 23 adults and 30 children. We confirm the wide heterogeneity of adult M7. In adults, the cytogenetic abnormalities are frequently those of secondary leukaemia while a few patients have a previous history and morphological features of dyshaematopoiesis; their outcome is very poor. Among children, besides the well-known Down syndrome M7, we in particular, studied ten t(1;22) M7 and one OTT-MAL transcript positive case with normal karyotype presenting specific features. We were already aware of their younger age, female and tumoral presentation, but we also found a lower percentage of bone marrow blasts, sometimes without any megakaryoblastic bone marrow involvement, but always, with a dysmegakaryocytopoiesis associated with micromegakaryocytes. They are generally good responders to intensive AML chemotherapy with very long disease-free survivals (DFS). Accordingly, OTT-MAL transcript study, in infant M7 with normal karyotype, is recommended and we feel that this entity should be added to the WHO AML classification.","['Duchayne, Eliane', 'Fenneteau, Odile', 'Pages, Marie-Pierre', 'Sainty, Danielle', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Garand, Richard', 'Flandrin, Georges']","['Duchayne E', 'Fenneteau O', 'Pages MP', 'Sainty D', 'Arnoulet C', 'Dastugue N', 'Garand R', 'Flandrin G']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Hopital Purpan, 31059 Toulouse-Purpan, France. duchayne.e@chu-toulouse.fr""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Blood Cells/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Size', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*classification/complications/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000040279 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):49-58. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000040279.,,,,,,"[""Groupe Francais d'Hematologie Cellulaire"", 'Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the results of CALGB study 9013, providing a 10-year follow-up on 88 evaluable previously untreated patients. Cycles of therapy with rIFNalpha-2b and araC sufficient to cause a decline in either the white blood cell (WBC) count to < 2000/microl or platelets to < 50,000/microl were given. The starting dose of rIFNalpha-2b was 5 million units (mu)/m2/day subcutaneously (s.c.) and of araC 10 mg/m2 twice daily s.c. Treatment was discontinued when cytopenia occurred and was restarted when both the WBC and platelet counts had recovered. Bone marrow was obtained regularly for morphologic, cytogenetic and molecular studies. Medians at entry included age 48 years, WBC = 89,900/microl and platelets = 345,000/microl. The performance status was 0 or 1 in 88%; splenomegaly was present in 46%. Fifty five (63%) patients had a complete hematologic response and 10 (11%) had a partial hematologic response for an overall response rate of 74%. Median time to best response was 5.3 months. Median survival for all patients from study entry was 81 months, the 5-year survival probability was 65%.

Sixty-three patients had adequate follow-up cytogenetic studies: 10 had a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR), 23 partial (PCyR, 50-99% normal cells), 20 minor and 10 no response (CALGB criteria). Thus, the CCyR plus PCyR rate among these 63 patients was 52%. Assuming the 25 patients with no cytogenetic follow-up as non-responders, 38% of the 88 patients had at least a PCyR. The median time to CCyR or PCyR was 5.6 months. The median time to best response in these 33 patients was 10.0 months, and median duration of cytogenetic response was 28 months. Cytogenetic responders had significantly longer survival than non-responders (p = 0.01) using a landmark analysis at 18 months.

In relapsed leukaemia post-stem cell transplant, DLI can achieve durable remissions in 60-73% patients. Technical improvements in molecular methods of detection of the BCR-ABL transcripts permit the prediction of relapse with increased sensitivity and reproducibility. Use of DLI early at relapse is important since responses to DLI are less likely in the face of bulky or blast-phase disease. Exogenous interleukin-2 may enhance the response to DLI but total cell dose is also relevant to the efficacy of DLI with the effective cell dose (ECD) required being lower in HLA matched unrelated DLI donors compared to siblings. Donor T-lymphocytes target minor histocompatibility (H) antigens and the relative tissue distribution of these may influence the toxicity of DLI, which includes graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD). Modified methods of delivery such as selective deletion of CD8+ cells or escalating cell dosage regimens have reduced the incidence of serious morbidity due to GVHD without compromising the GVL effect mediated by DLI. These approaches have not removed the risk of GVHD entirely and conditional suicide protocols utilising the HSV-tk or fas receptor derived genes are being developed in the clinic. Since significant morbidity and mortality is attributable to the conditioning regimen used prior to HSCT, awareness of the potency of DLI has driven the development of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. The purpose of RIC is to enhance tolerisation of the host to the graft while permitting the establishment of donor haemopoiesis. DLI may then be used subsequently to enhance the GVL effect.","['Gilleece, Maria H', 'Dazzi, Francesco']","['Gilleece MH', 'Dazzi F']","['Department of Haematology and Immunology, Imperial College Faculty of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK. maria.gilleece@nww-tr.wales.nhs.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/adverse effects/*methods', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",62,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000050061 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Jan;44(1):23-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000050061.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) the role of ABMT is well defined. Some studies suggest that it is also beneficial for adult patients with high-risk factors or with relapse. However, these inferences are based on a relatively small number of patients with short follow-up. Nevertheless patients with high-risk ALL are candidates for ABMT if no histocompatible sibling is available. Similarly patients in second or later complete remission (CR) in the absence of a histocompatible donor may derive benefit from ABMT. The different conditioning regimens used by the treatment centers are associated with different toxicities but none has been proven to be superior than others. In the majority of studies the marrow has been purged of leukemic cells, but this maneuver has never been evaluated in a randomized comparative trial. Transplant related mortality rate of ABMT is low compared to allogeneic transplantation. The GvL effect, which is important to eliminate malignant cells in acute and chronic myelocytic leukemia, has not been definitively demonstrated in ALL. The tyrosine-kinase inhibitor STI 571 offers new perspectives for patients with the Phl/bcr/abl translocation.

In patients with solid tumors, a low-grade activated coagulation can result in systemic and cerebral arterial or venous thrombosis. Cancer treatments may also contribute to this coagulopathy, which usually, but not exclusively, occurs in the setting of advanced malignant disease. There may be TIAs or cerebral infarctions. Because of the widespread distribution of cerebral thromboses, there may be a superimposed encephalopathy; sometimes this is the only sign. Concurrent systemic thrombosis is present in many patients and is a useful clue to the diagnosis. In cerebral venous occlusion, the initial symptom is usually a headache. Except for cerebral intravascular coagulation that is unassociated with NBTE, neuriomaging studies usually demonstrate one or more parenchymal infarctions. MRI or MRV may demonstrate venous thrombosis. The laboratory evidence of coagulopathy is difficult to distinguish from the asymptomatic coagulopathy that often accompanies advanced cancer, and the test results must be interpreted cautiously. NBTE can be diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiography. There is no established treatment for the thrombotic coagulopathy associated with cancer, but anticoagulation should be considered. In leukemia and lymphoma, the coagulopathy is typically acute DIC that can lead to systemic and brain hemorrhages. It is especially common in acute myelogenous leukemias. The clinical signs of cerebral hemorrhage are fulminant and may be fatal. The bleeding usually occurs in the brain or subdural compartment, and rarely in the subarachnoid space. The diagnosis can be suspected by the clinical setting and by systemic thrombosis or hemorrhage. It can be established by examination of the peripheral smear, the platelet count, and tests of coagulation function. Therapy of acute DIC is controversial and should be individualized for the clinical setting. Cerebrovascular disorders can complicate metastatic or primary tumor in the brain, skull, dura, or leptomeninges. The clinical signs of infarction are indistinguishable from other causes of stroke, except that tumor-related venous occlusion will usually first produce signs of increased intracranial pressure. The diagnosis of tumor-related infarction can usually be established by neuroimaging studies that show infarction and may show extracerebral sites of tumor. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing leptomeningeal metastasis. A search for lung or cardiac tumor should be performed when embolic tumor infarction is suspected. Primary or metastatic tumors in the brain or dura may hemorrhage, producing the initial clinical signs of the brain tumor or a change in chronic signs induced by the tumor. There are helpful clues to a neoplastic hemorrhage on brain CT or MRI scans. The brain hemorrhage may require evacuation and the underlying tumor will usually require additional antineoplastic treatment. Hyperleukocytosis (extreme elevation of the cell count) in acute myelogenous leukemia is a less common cause of brain hemorrhage in recent years because of improved methods to lower the cell count. Cerebral arterial or venous thrombosis is sometimes the result of cancer therapy. The attribution of thrombosis to chemotherapy in many published cases is only speculative, because carefully conducted prospective studies that include investigation for other thrombotic causes are not available. The best-known associations with thrombosis are L-asparaginase, which is typically used in the induction therapy of acute lymphocytic leukemia, and combination hormonal therapy and chemotherapy for breast cancer. Radiation to the head and neck, typically administered for head and neck epithelial cancers or lymphoma, may result in delayed carotid atherosclerosis. The distribution of stenosis or occlusion is within the radiation portal and is typically more extensive than is atherosclerosis that develops in the absence of radiation. Small clinical series suggest that surgical treatment is equally effective as in nonirradiated carotid atherosclerosis. In children, the cerebral vessels can be affected by brain radiation resulting in stenosis or occlusion. Brain hemorrhages can result from chemotherapy effects on the hemostatic system or a microangiopathic anemia. Hemorrhages from radiation-induced vascular abnormalities are rare. Opportunistic infections, especially fungal infections, can complicate cancer or its treatment. Septic cerebral emboli may result in focal cerebral signs, seizures, or encephalopathy. Sometimes there is an associated hemorrhagic vasculitis or cerebritis. Rarely, mycotic aneurysms may bleed. A high index of suspicion is needed to diagnose fungal infection because of the difficulty in culturing the organism from the blood or CSF. A clinician can usually establish the cause of stroke in the cancer patient by performing a careful review of the clinical setting--including the type and extent of cancer and the type of antineoplastic therapy--in which the stroke occurred. Systemic thrombosis, embolism, or hemorrhage can be a clue to the cause, and appropriate neuroimaging and coagulation studies to aid in the diagnosis are available. Therapy may ameliorate symptoms or prevent further episodes. The identification of one of these unusual stroke syndromes that leads to the diagnosis of an occult and treatable cancer can be particularly rewarding.","['Rogers, Lisa R']",['Rogers LR'],"['Departments of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Hermelin Brain Tumor Center, Henry Ford Hospital, 2799 West Grand Boulevard, Detroit, MI 48202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Neurol Clin,Neurologic clinics,8219232,IM,"['Brain/pathology', 'Cerebral Angiography', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neoplasms/*complications']",87,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0733-8619(02)00066-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0733-8619(02)00066-x [doi]']",ppublish,Neurol Clin. 2003 Feb;21(1):167-92. doi: 10.1016/s0733-8619(02)00066-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic antigen presenting cells (APCs) combining optimal antigen presentation and tumour antigenicity could be used as potent T cell activators. For clinical purposes it is desirable to culture APCs under serum-free conditions. Therefore, we compared morphological, immunophenotypical and functional outcome of the serum-free culture of AML-APCs to their serum-enriched culture. METHODS: AML blasts (n=19) were cultured in the presence of either a cytokine mix or calcium ionophore (CI) for 14 and 2 days, respectively, in FCS-containing medium (FCS), StemSpan serum-free medium (SP) and CellGro serum-free medium (CG). After culture relative yields were calculated and immunophenotypic analysis of APC markers was performed. The mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) was used to determine T cell stimulating capacity. RESULTS: Serum-free culture of AML-APCs resulted in comparable morphology, relative yields and immunophenotype to serum-enriched culture. By comparing both serum-free media we observed a trend towards a more mature phenotype of CI-cultured AML-APCs in SP. MLR showed that serum-free cultured cells have equal T cell stimulatory capacity in comparison with serum-enriched culture. CONCLUSION: These data show that the serum-free culture of AML-APCs is feasible and that these APCs are comparable to serum-enriched cultured AML-APCs with regard to morphological, immunophenotypical and functional characteristics. These AML-APCs are suitable for the development of active specific immunisation protocols which meet the criteria for good clinical practise (GCP).","['Houtenbos, Ilse', 'Westers, Theresia M', 'Stam, Anita G M', 'de Gruijl, Tanja D', 'Scheper, Rik J', 'Ossenkoppele, Gert J', 'van de Loosdrecht, Arjan A']","['Houtenbos I', 'Westers TM', 'Stam AG', 'de Gruijl TD', 'Scheper RJ', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'van de Loosdrecht AA']","['Department of Haematology BR 250, VU University Medical Center, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Survival', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Vaccination']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/26 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2002/10/31 00:00 [received]', '2003/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-003-0389-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Jul;52(7):455-62. doi: 10.1007/s00262-003-0389-4.

In the present study Hsp70 membrane expression was studied on primary malignant melanomas, melanoma metastases, melanocytes, human skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes, together with expression of the melanoma-associated markers Mel-1, Mel-2 and Mel-5, major histocompatibility complex class I and the fibroblast-specific marker ASO2. As previously shown, fibroblasts and peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy human volunteers were found to be negative for Hsp70 and for the melanoma-associated markers Mel-1, Mel-2 and Mel-5. Human melanocytes from healthy human donors were also negative for Hsp70, but were positive for Mel-1 and Mel-5. Independent of the Clark's level, all the malignant melanomas (n = 9) and metastases (n = 11) exhibited were positive for both Mel-1 and Mel-2. The primary melanomas could be divided into two groups according to their Hsp70 and Mel-5 expression pattern: those with an Hsp70-negative and a Mel-5-positive phenotype (-/+) (five out of nine), and those with an Hsp70-positive and a Mel-5-negative phenotype (+/-) (four out of nine). All the melanoma metastases (n = 11) had an Hsp70-positive, Mel-5-negative phenotype (+/-). These data provide the first hint that the marker combination Hsp70 positive/Mel-5 negative might be useful in estimating the metastatic potential of a melanoma.

Resveratrol inhibited proliferation of both cell lines in a dose-dependent fashion (5-75 microM) by arresting the cells at S phase, thus preventing their progression through the cell cycle; IL-1beta partially reversed this inhibitory effect. Resveratrol significantly reduced production of IL-1beta in OCIM2 cells. It also suppressed the IL-1beta-induced activation of transcription factor nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB), which modulates an array of signals controlling cellular survival, proliferation, and cytokine production. Indeed, incubation of OCIM2 cells with resveratrol resulted in apoptotic cell death. Because caspase inhibitors Ac-DEVD-CHO or z-DEVD-FMK partially reversed the antiproliferative effect of resveratrol, we tested its effect on the caspase pathway and found that resveratrol induced the activation of the cysteine protease caspase 3 and subsequent cleavage of the DNA repair enzyme poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase. Finally, resveratrol suppressed colony-forming cell proliferation of fresh AML marrow cells from 5 patients with newly diagnosed AML in a dose-dependent fashion. Taken together, our data showing that resveratrol is an effective in vitro inhibitor of AML cells suggest that this compound may have a role in future therapies for AML.","['Estrov, Zeev', 'Shishodia, Shishir', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Harris, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Aggarwal, Bharat B']","['Estrov Z', 'Shishodia S', 'Faderl S', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, Box 422, University of Texas M.

It is known that fibronectin (FN) produced and assembled by the malignant hairy cells (HCs) themselves is a major component of this fibrosis. It is also known that FN production is greatly enhanced by adhesion of HCs to hyaluronan (HA) via CD44. The aim of the present study was to establish the roles of fibrogenic autocrine cytokines (fibroblast growth factor-2 [FGF-2] and transforming growth factor beta [TGFbeta]) and of different isoforms of CD44 in this FN production. We show that HC adhesion to HA stimulates FGF-2, but not TGFbeta, production and that HCs possess FGF-2 receptor. In a range of experiments, FN production was greatly reduced by blocking FGF-2 but not TGFbeta. Moreover FN, but not FGF-2, secretion was blocked by down-regulation of the v3 isoform of CD44 and by addition of heparitinase. These results show that autocrine FGF-2 secreted by HCs is the principal cytokine responsible for FN production by these cells when cultured on HA. The central role of FGF-2 in the pathogenesis of the BM fibrosis of HCL was supported by our immunohistochemical demonstration of large amounts of this cytokine in fibrotic BM but not in HCL spleen where there is no fibrosis. As regards CD44 isoforms, the present work demonstrates that CD44v3 is essential for providing the heparan sulfate necessary for HC stimulation by FGF-2, whereas the signal for production of the cytokine was provided by HA binding to CD44H, the standard hematopoietic form of the molecule.","['Aziz, Khalil A', 'Till, Kathleen J', 'Chen, Haijuan', 'Slupsky, Joseph R', 'Campbell, Fiona', 'Cawley, John C', 'Zuzel, Mirko']","['Aziz KA', 'Till KJ', 'Chen H', 'Slupsky JR', 'Campbell F', 'Cawley JC', 'Zuzel M']","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Fibronectins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Hyaluronic Acid/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*etiology/metabolism', 'Protein Isoforms/physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis', 'Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2', 'Receptors, Fibroblast Growth Factor/analysis', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/biosynthesis']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3737 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50588-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1051-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3737.

P-glycoprotein (Pgp) confers resistance to GO and is associated with a worse clinical response. To address whether multidrug resistance protein (MRP) affects GO susceptibility, we characterized Pgp, MRP1, and MRP2 expression in CD33+ cell lines and CD33+ AML samples and analyzed the effect of the Pgp inhibitor cyclosporine (CSA) and the MRP inhibitor MK-571 on GO-induced cytotoxicity. MRP1, but not MRP2, expression correlated with MRP activity. MK-571 enhanced GO-induced cytotoxicity in Pgp-negative/MRP-positive NB4 and HL-60 cells. CSA, but not MK-571 alone, restored GO susceptibility in Pgp-positive/MRP-positive TF1 cells; however, MK-571 enhanced cytotoxicity in the presence of CSA. All patient samples exhibited MRP activity, and 17 of 23 exhibited Pgp activity. CSA increased GO-induced cytotoxicity in 12 Pgp-positive samples, whereas MK-571 alone was effective in only one sample with minimal Pgp activity. In 3 Pgp-positive/MRP-positive samples, MK-571 enhanced GO-induced cytotoxicity in the presence of CSA. Thus, MRP1 may attenuate susceptibility to GO. This effect was comparatively less than that for Pgp and required the inhibition of Pgp for detection in cells that coexpressed both transporters. Because MK-571 and CSA failed to affect cytotoxicity in a portion of Pgp-positive/MRP-positive AML samples, additional resistance mechanisms are likely important.","['Walter, Roland B', 'Raden, Brian W', 'Hong, Tom C', 'Flowers, David A', 'Bernstein, Irwin D', 'Linenberger, Michael L']","['Walter RB', 'Raden BW', 'Hong TC', 'Flowers DA', 'Bernstein ID', 'Linenberger ML']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. rwalter@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gemtuzumab', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Propionates/pharmacology', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-02-0396 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44319-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 15;102(4):1466-73. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-02-0396.

We report here that the active phosphorylated form of MAPK/ERK is aberrantly expressed in cultured and primary HD cells. Inhibition of the upstream MAPK kinase (also called MEK) by the small molecule UO126 inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK and demonstrated a dose- and time-dependent antiproliferative activity in HD cell lines. UO126 modulated the levels of several intracellular proteins including B-cell lymphoma protein 2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and caspase 8 homolog FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP), and induced G2M cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis. Furthermore, UO126 potentiated the activity of apoliprotein 2/tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (APO2L/TRAIL) and chemotherapy-induced cell death. Activation of CD30, CD40, and receptor activator of nuclear kappabeta (RANK) receptors in HD cells by their respective ligands increased ERK phosphorylation above the basal level and promoted HD cell survival. UO126 inhibited basal and ligand-induced ERK phosphorylation, and inhibited ligand-induced cell survival of HD cell lines.

A cooperating mutation that enhanced survival (BCL2) was not sufficient to complete transformation and was associated with multiple numeric abnormalities, whereas cooperating mutations that deregulated growth and enhanced survival were associated with normal karyotypes (IL3) or simple karyotypic changes (IL3R, FLT3).

Although it has been suggested that these T cells might be tumor specific, concrete evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. We performed a detailed immunophenotypic analysis of the T-cell compartment in the peripheral blood of 28 patients with B-CLL (Rai 0, n = 12; Rai I-II, n = 10; Rai III-IV, n = 6) and 12 healthy age-matched controls and measured the ability of these patients to mount specific immune responses. In all Rai stages a significant increase in the absolute numbers of CD3+ cells was observed. Whereas the number of CD4+ cells was not different from controls, patients with B-CLL showed significantly increased relative and absolute numbers of CD8+ cells, which exhibited a CD45RA+CD27- cytotoxic phenotype. Analysis of specific immune responses with tetrameric cytomegalovirus (CMV)-peptide complexes showed that patients with B-CLL had significantly increased numbers of tetramer-binding CMV-specific CD8+ T cells. The rise in the total number of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells was evident only in CMV-seropositive B-CLL patients. Thus, our data suggest that in patients with B-CLL the composition of T cells is shifted toward a CD8+ cytotoxic cell type in an effort to control infections with persistent viruses such as CMV. Moreover, they offer an explanation for the high incidence of CMV reactivation in CLL patients treated with T cell-depleting agents, such as the monoclonal antibody (mAb) alemtuzumab (Campath; alpha-CD52 mAb). Furthermore, because in CMV-seronegative patients no increase in cytotoxic CD8+ T cells is found, our studies do not support the hypothesis that tumor-specific T cells account for T-cell expansion in B-CLL.","['Mackus, Wendelina J M', 'Frakking, Florine N J', 'Grummels, Annette', 'Gamadia, Laila E', 'De Bree, Godelieve J', 'Hamann, Dorte', 'Van Lier, Rene A W', 'Van Oers, Marinus H J']","['Mackus WJ', 'Frakking FN', 'Grummels A', 'Gamadia LE', 'De Bree GJ', 'Hamann D', 'Van Lier RA', 'Van Oers MH']","['Department of Hematology, Academic Medical Center, Rm F4-210, University of Amsterdam, PO Box 22660, 1100 DD Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'CD8 Antigens/analysis', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytomegalovirus/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/*virology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/analysis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 7/analysis']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0182 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50589-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1057-63. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0182.

The apoptosis was associated with a concomitant activation of caspase-3 without evidence of dependence on functional p53 or Bcl-2 family modulation. In this study, we examined flavopiridol-induced apoptosis in terms of upstream caspase activity, cell cycle distribution and signal transduction, in order to elucidate the mechanism of action of this potent cytotoxic agent. Flavopiridol-induced apoptosis was significantly abrogated by the caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK (p = 0.002; paired t-test) but was not altered by the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK (p = 0.37; paired t-test). There was a concentration-dependent increase in a sub G0/G1 peak indicative of apoptotic cells but if these cells were excluded by gating no other cell cycle perturbations were observed suggesting that flavopiridol is capable of inducing apoptosis in cells in all phases of the cell cycle. Significantly, apoptosis was associated with activation of p38 MAP kinase and suppression of ERK activity (p = 0.0036 and p = 0.0048, respectively; paired t-test). These results show for the first time that flavopiridol modulates specific cellular signal transduction pathways in B-CLL cells thereby altering the balance between survival and cell death signals and providing a rationale for the p53-independent nature of flavopiridol-induced apoptosis. Further work is required to identify whether combinations of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and novel agents like flavopiridol can be used to improve patient outcomes in the treatment of B-CLL.","['Pepper, Chris', 'Thomas, Alun', 'Fegan, Chris', 'Hoy, Terry', 'Bentley, Paul']","['Pepper C', 'Thomas A', 'Fegan C', 'Hoy T', 'Bentley P']","['Department of Haematology, Llandough Hospital, Penlan Road, Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, CF64 2XX, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Piperidines/*pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Signal Transduction', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000029984 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Feb;44(2):337-42. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000029984.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Piperidines)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible migration and autocrine mechanism.",329-36,"Chemokine receptors mediate the migration of lymphocytes through the binding of ligands, and the expression is differentially regulated in lymphocyte subsets. CXCR3 is usually expressed in Th1 T cells, however, recently is reported to be expressed in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type lymphoma (MALT) (extranodal marginal zone lymphoma), and other B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Our study was designed to investigate the expression of CXCR3 and its ligand Mig, and their relationships in MALT using immunohistochemistry. In addition, CCR4, which is characteristic Th2 helper phenotype, and its ligand thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), were compared with CXCR3, as Th1 phenotype. We studied 14 cases of gastric B cell lymphoma [low-grade MALT, 5 cases; high-grade MALT, 5 cases; and diffuse large (DL), 4 cases] and 16 cases of thyroid B cell lymphoma [low-grade MALT, 4 cases; high-grade MALT, 5 cases; and DL, 7 cases]. CXCR3-expressing lymphoid cells were detected in all cases. In double immunostaining (CXCR3-CD20), gastric and thyroid low/high MALT showed CXCR3-positive neoplastic B cells, but DL, except two cases, did not. In DL, CXCR3-positive lymphoid cells were mainly reactive T-cells (CD3-positive cells). Mig was expressed mainly in stromal cells (histiocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells). In gastric lymphoma, low-grade MALT contained abundant Mig-strongly expressing cells, while staining in high-grade MALT and DL was mild. In thyroid lymphoma, staining was strong in low- and high-grade MALT, but moderate in DL. In double-staining, CXCR3-Mig-coexpressing lymphoma cells were abundant in high MALT of the stomach and thyroid, but rare in other subtypes. TARC-positive cells and CCR4-positive cells were rarely encountered in all cases. Our results indicate a tendency for low-grade MALT to contain CXCR3(+)Mig- lymphoma cells, high-grade to contain CXCR3(+)Mig+ and DL to contain CRCR3(-)Mig- lymphoma cells. We speculate that CXCR3 is associated with migration of lymphoma cells in low-grade MALT, and autocrine function in high-grade MALT, and not associated with any function in DL.","['Ohshima, Koichi', 'Suefuji, Hiroaki', 'Karube, Kennosuke', 'Hamasaki, Makoto', 'Hatano, Ben', 'Tutiya, Takeshi', 'Yamaguchi, Takahiro', 'Suzuki, Keiko', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Kikuchi, Masahiro']","['Ohshima K', 'Suefuji H', 'Karube K', 'Hamasaki M', 'Hatano B', 'Tutiya T', 'Yamaguchi T', 'Suzuki K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka 814-0180, Japan. ohshima@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Movement', 'Chemokine CCL17', 'Chemokine CXCL9', 'Chemokines, CC/analysis', 'Chemokines, CXC/*analysis/physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*analysis/physiology', 'Ligands', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/chemistry/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, CXCR3', 'Receptors, CXCR4/analysis', 'Receptors, Chemokine/*analysis/physiology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/chemistry', 'Th1 Cells/chemistry', 'Th2 Cells/chemistry', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819031000060546 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Feb;44(2):329-36. doi: 10.1080/1042819031000060546.,,"['0 (CCL17 protein, human)', '0 (CXCL9 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR3 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CCL17)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL9)', '0 (Chemokines, CC)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Chemokine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little information is available concerning the origin of ECs after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in CML. To determine the extent of mixed chimerism (MCh) a simultaneous immunohistochemical and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) study was performed on BM biopsies derived from patients following sex-mismatched BMT with full unmanipulated BM. ECs were identified by their staining with CD34 and the myofibroblasts (MFs) of large vessels were labeled by an antibody against alpha-smooth muscle actin. For sex-typing and demonstration of the bcr/abl fusion product appropriate commercially available probes and detection systems were applied. Contrasting a total congruence of labeling in control samples five patients showed donor type ECs in the early posttransplant period in about 20%. In the remaining four patients the amount of donor type ECs increased slightly after the third month up to 30%. A total of 26 MFs could be identified lining large capillaries and arterioles that exclusively revealed a host origin. Following successful engraftment only very few of the persistent host-derived ECs also displayed the bcr/abl gene. In five patients, a conversion of MCh from donor to host type ECs was recognizable during the evolution of leukemic relapse. This finding was accompanied by a bcr/abl rearrangement of about 10% of these cells. In conclusion, following myelo-ablative therapy, a survival of a considerable number of ECs and MFs of the vessel walls has been found implying persistence of host-derived vascular structures of the BM stroma. However, in only a small proportion bcr/abl+ ECs and thus minimal residual disease was detectable. Evolution of leukemic relapse was characterized by conversion of MCh with almost total loss of donor type ECs and increase in number of bcr/abl+ ECs.","['Kvasnicka, Hans M', 'Wickenhauser, Claudia', 'Thiele, Juergen', 'Varus, Eva', 'Hamm, Katharina', 'Beelen, Dietrich W', 'Schaefer, Ullrich W']","['Kvasnicka HM', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Thiele J', 'Varus E', 'Hamm K', 'Beelen DW', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmannstr.9, D-50924 Cologne, Germany. hm.kvasnicka@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Vessels/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/*blood supply', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000035699 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Feb;44(2):321-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000035699.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical manifestations of mastocytosis range from disseminated maculopapular skin lesions (= urticaria pigmentosa [UP]) that may spontaneously regress to highly aggressive neoplasms like mast cell leukemia or mast cell sarcoma. Recently, it could be shown that systemic mastocytosis (SM) is a clonal disorder often exhibiting mutations of c-kit, a protooncogene encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor (SCF). Mutations of c-kit are considered to play a key role in the pathogenesis of mastocytosis. Therefore, we investigated the unique case of a 36 year-old male patient with indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) evolving from UP (cutaneous mastocytosis) by means of histology, immunophenotyping and molecular biology. At the time of initial diagnosis the bone marrow showed only a mild diffuse increase in mast cells but compact infiltrates were missing. The serum tryptase levels were normal. Five years later, however, the bone marrow histology displayed patchycompact mast cell infiltrates, which now allowed to establish the diagnosis of an ISM. The serum tryptase levels at this time were markedly elevated. At both time points, mast cells were analyzed by immunohistochemistry using anti-tryptase antibody AA1, by flow cytometry using antibodies against CD2 and CD25, and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on laser-microdissected, single pooled mast cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong tryptase-positivity of mast cells in both cutaneous and bone marrow infiltrates. Flow cytometry yielded an aberrant expression of CD2 and CD25 on bone marrow mast cells. However, repeated thorough PCR analysis failed to unveil c-kit mutation in atypical mast cells of skin and bone marrow samples of both dates. These findings clearly show that ISM can evolve from UP. Moreover, our study provides further evidence that the c-kit mutation Asp-816-Val is not invariably present in ISM.","['Noack, F', 'Escribano, L', 'Sotlar, K', 'Nunez, R', 'Schuetze, K', 'Valent, P', 'Horny, H P']","['Noack F', 'Escribano L', 'Sotlar K', 'Nunez R', 'Schuetze K', 'Valent P', 'Horny HP']","['Department of Pathology, University of Luebeck, Ratzeburger Allee 160, Luebeck, 23538, Germany. noack@patho.mu-luebeck.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'CD2 Antigens/analysis', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Cutaneous/diagnosis/pathology', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/analysis', 'Serine Endopeptidases/analysis', 'Tryptases', 'Urticaria Pigmentosa/diagnosis/*pathology']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000037967 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Feb;44(2):313-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000037967.,,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remission rates of over 95% have been obtained, however, about 5% of stage I and II patients will suffer from progressive disease while on therapy and an additional 15-20% will relapse. Chemotherapy (Ch) alone has not been adequately tested in early-stage HD. In this study, all HD stage I and II patients treated with Ch alone in the University Hospital ""Clinica Puerta de Hierro"" between 1980 and 1997 were reviewed. Thirty-five patients were treated between 04/80 and 12/97. All patients achieved complete remission. The median follow-up was 119 months (range 21-240 months), no patients were lost at follow-up. Overall survival (OS) was 97% (IC 95%, 92-100) at 5 years and 88% (IC 95%, 75-100) at 10 years. Failure free survival (FFS) was 93% (IC 95%, 83-100) at 5 years and 66% (IC 95%, 47-86) at 10 years. Three (8.5%) patients died: two due to a second tumour (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and myeloid acute leukaemia) and the other due to sepsis post-Ch.

Other prognostic factors did not reveal significant differences with respect to failure free or OS. In conclusion, we believe that death from HD in early-stage patients is unusual and mortality from causes other than HD occurs many years later.

Indeed, p35Nck5a and/or Cdk5 activity has been demonstrated to be present in human and rat promyelocytic cell lines, and in normal human monocytes. Further, monocytes from mice in which p35Nck5a gene was deleted do not express non-specific esterase, an enzyme present in normal monocytes, while transfection of Cdk5 together with p35Nck5a into myeloblastic cells leads to the expression of this marker of the monocytic phenotype.

They are frequently characterized by leukemic manifestations with peripheral blood and/or bone marrow involvement. B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), a disease which is now accepted as derived from immunologicallycompetent antigen-activated B-cells, is the most common in the western countries. Although for several decades it was considered as a unique entity, a body of evidences is now emerging indicating the biological heterogeneity of B-CLL. Molecular and immunophenotypic data induce to consider two main subgroups of B-CLL exist at the cellular level: in fact, B-CLL cases can be divided into two categories according to IgV gene mutation status. One group develops from ""memory"" B-cells after antigenic stimulation in the germinal center of secondary follicles, displays mutated gene IgV and lacks CD38 expression; the second one derives from the so-called ""naive"" antigen inexperienced B-cells, does not present IgV gene mutations and displays CD38 surface molecule. The two groups seem to be characterised by different clinical outcomes with the ""mutated"" group expected to have a more benign course than that arising from a ""naive"" B-cell. Thus, the definition of the biological features of these different groups could be of help for clinicians in order to recognize patients needing more intensive therapeutic approaches.","[""D'Arena, Giovanni"", 'Di Renzo, Nicola', 'Brugiatelli, Maura', 'Vigliotti, Maria L', 'Keating, Michael J']","[""D'Arena G"", 'Di Renzo N', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Vigliotti ML', 'Keating MJ']","['Hematology and Oncology Unit, C.R.O.B.

In this study, we examined the effect of activation of protein kinase C (PKC) in c-Myc protein expression in association with the induction of apoptosis and differentiation in TNF-alpha-treated HL-60 cells. Pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of PKC, prevented TNF-alpha-induced rapid onset of apoptosis, which occurs at 3 h culture with TNF-alpha, concomitantly with the up-regulation of c-Myc protein expression. In addition, PMA enhanced TNF-a-induced differentiation at 24h treatment. This was documented by the expression of integrin Mac-1 molecule (CD11b) on the cell surface and the cellular adhesion to the plastic bottom of the flask, indicating the differentiation along with the monocyte/macrophage lineage. These results indicate that activation of PKC not only counteracts apoptosis but also enhances differentiation in TNF-alpha-treated HL-60 cells. Up-regulation of c-Myc protein evoked by pretreatment with PMA for a short time could disturb the signaling pathway of the ceramide and sphingosine, which are known to function as the endogenous modulators mediating the apoptotic signal of TNF-alpha. Our results strongly suggest the role of c-Myc protein as a mediator of cytoprotective effect of PKC pathway, and PKC pathway opposes apoptosis and consequently undergo differentiation via rapid up-regulated c-Myc protein expression during TNF-alpha signaling of HL-60 cells. Our findings provide a new insight for a role of PKC and c-Myc protein with special reference to the regulatory mechanisms in the decision of cellular fate, differentiation or apoptosis.","['Kumakura, Shunichi', 'Ishikura, Hiroto', 'Maniwa, Yasuhisa', 'Munemasa, Shoso', 'Tsumura, Hiroto', 'Masuda, Junichi', 'Kobayashi, Shotai']","['Kumakura S', 'Ishikura H', 'Maniwa Y', 'Munemasa S', 'Tsumura H', 'Masuda J', 'Kobayashi S']","['Division of Blood Transfusion, Shimane Medical University, Izumo, 693-8501, Japan. kumakura@shimane-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'CD11b Antigen/analysis', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', '*Genes, myc', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000047010 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):497-503. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000047010.,,"['0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used the chemotherapy protocol for ALL patients according to the St Jude Total XI study group. Medical records of all 194 patients who achieved complete remission were reviewed to determine the absolute blast count (ABC) in peripheral blood smears from day 0 of treatment until day 8. A target response of 1,000 blast/mm3 was employed. The time in which ABC remained > or = 1,000/mm3 and the EFS rates were assessed in group A (n = 44) and B (n = 51) of high risk patients. Group A and B patients were branched to chemotherapy schedules (A1, B1: steroid + vincristine + daunorubicine + intrathecal + 3 doses L-asparaginase; A2, B2: steroid + vincristine + daunorubicine + intrathecal; A3, B3: only steroid monotherapy). Number of patients from whom the ABC remained > or = 1,000/mm3 during all 7 days of induction treatment and the median number of days for blasts to reach the target level were significantly lower in group B1 than A1 (p < 0.05), concordantly the 8-year EFS was higher in group B1 (p = 0.01). In comparison of the subgroups, results of A2 and A3 were worse than of group B2 and B3. These findings strongly suggest that the effects of HDMP on blast cytoreduction and EFS are more potent than conventional dose steroids.","['Yetgin, Sevgi', 'Cetin, Mualla']","['Yetgin S', 'Cetin M']","[""Faculty of Medicine, Department of Paediatric Haematology, Section of Haematology, Hacettepe University, Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital, Ankara, 06100, Turkey. yetgins@superonline.com""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000055048 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):489-95. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000055048.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may be implicated in this protective mechanism. The aim of the present study was to determine the expression of apoptosis-related proteins in cHL among adult patients and correlate them with EBV expression, clinical findings and survival. EBV was detected by in situ hybridization (Epstein-Barr Encoded RNA, EBER, probe). Immunohistochemistry was used on paraffin sections to detect LMP-1/EBV, CD15 and the apoptosis-related proteins (bcl-2, bax, bcl-X, mcl-1 and CD95). Seventy-eight patients seen at our Institution were studied: 36 male and 42 female. Median age was 31 years (15-75 years). Histological types of cHL were: 61 nodular sclerosis (47 NS1 and 14 NS2), 15 mixed cellularity (MC), 1 lymphocyte depletion and 1 unclassified. In 50 cases there was EBV expression (64%). At least one apoptosis-associated protein was expressed in 92% and CD15 in 57.7% of the cases. In the univariate analysis, the following variables were related to a better overall survival: expression of CD15 (p = 0.023), expression of mcl-1 protein (p = 0.029), expression of bcl-2 protein (p = 0.028, only in a Cox model after stratification for histology) and expression of LMP-1 (p = 0.042). EBV expression presented a borderline inverse correlation with bcl-2. A prognostic index (PI) developed in the present study revealed that simultaneous expression of bcl-2, mcl-1 and LMP-1 was significant and independently correlated with an excellent survival.","['Vassallo, Jose', 'Metze, Konradin', 'Traina, Fabiola', 'de Souza, Carmino A', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene']","['Vassallo J', 'Metze K', 'Traina F', 'de Souza CA', 'Lorand-Metze I']","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas (UNICAMP), PO Box 6111, 13081-970 Campinas, Sao Paulo, Brazil. glaujv@fcm.unicamp.br']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*metabolism/mortality/pathology/virology', 'Humans', 'Lewis X Antigen/*analysis', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis', 'RNA, Viral/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Virus Infections/metabolism', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/analysis', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/analysis']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000037958 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):483-8. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000037958.,,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (EBV-associated membrane antigen, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 1)', '0 (Epstein-Barr virus encoded RNA 2)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (fas Receptor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, the Karpas 1718 cell line, which was derived from a patient with transformed SMZL and carried a trisomy of 3q, also evidenced the spontaneous loss of the extra 3q during the culturing process. Other acquired abnormalities observed exclusively in the transformation phase included amplification and/or translocation of bands 7p22-q22 and 19p13. These findings suggest that the loss of + 3q and the acquisition of other genomic imbalances may represent unique markers for the transformation process of SMZL.

This gene was also expressed in some of the hematological malignancies, including acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma. We and others have extensively evaluated the PRAME expression in various hematological malignancies and demonstrated high expression of the PRAME gene in subsets of AML, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma. In addition, we have demonstrated that PRAME was a useful marker for detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with leukemia, particularly those leukemias in which tumor specific markers are currently unavailable. Since PRAME was first identified as a tumor antigen recognized by T cells, the possibility that PRAME is a leukemia antigen recognized by T cells was evaluated, and it was found that PRAME-positive leukemia cell lines and fresh leukemia cells were susceptible to lysis by the PRAME-specific CTL. Five CTL epitopes associated with either HLA-A*0201 or HLA-A*2402 have recently been identified. It is, therefore, an attractive strategy to apply PRAME specific immunotherapy on patients with PRAME positive leukemia in MRD condition.","['Matsushita, Maiko', 'Yamazaki, Rie', 'Ikeda, Hideyuki', 'Kawakami, Yutaka']","['Matsushita M', 'Yamazaki R', 'Ikeda H', 'Kawakami Y']","['Division of Cellular Signaling, Institute forAdvanced Medical Research, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Mail code 160-8582 Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*immunology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",36,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000035725 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):439-44. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000035725.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been the focus of major efforts to develop potent drugs for several decades, but until recently cure rates remained low. A breakthrough in CML therapy was very likely accomplished with the clinical introduction of STI-571 [imatinib mesylate; Gleevec (USA); Glivec (other countries)] in 2000/2001. Despite the hope that STI-571 has generated for many CML patients, development of resistance to this drug is already apparent in some cases, especially if the CML is diagnosed in its later stages. Therefore, novel drugs which can be used alone or in combination with STI-571 are highly desirable. This review briefly summarises the current understanding and therapy of CML and then discusses in more detail basic laboratory research that attempts to target Grb2, an adaptor protein known to directly interact with the Bcr portion of the Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Blocking the binding of Grb2 to the GDP-releasing protein SoS is well known to abrogate the activation of the GTPase Ras, a major driving force of the central mitogenic (MAP kinase) pathway. Additional Grb2 effector proteins may also contribute to the proliferation-inhibiting effects observed upon uncoupling Grb2 from its downstream signalling system. Since Grb2 is a known signal transducer for several major human oncogenes, this approach may have applications for a wider range of human cancers.","['Feller, Stephan M', 'Tuchscherer, Gabriele', 'Voss, Jan']","['Feller SM', 'Tuchscherer G', 'Voss J']","['Cell Signalling Group, Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK. stephan.feller@.cancer.org.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Design', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Forecasting', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Piperazines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'ras Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'src Homology Domains']",263,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000037930 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):411-27. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000037930.,,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Son of Sevenless Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)', 'Y031I2N1EO (leptomycin B)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several investigations have revealed that these agents are active also in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Synergistic interaction between FA or 2-CdA with cytarabine (Ara-C) have been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. PNA enhance the cell concentration of Ara-CTP, which is active metabolite of Ara-C. It is likely that the addition of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may further improve the effects of FA (FLAG) or 2-CdA (CLAG). The addition of anthracyclines to induction therapy does not appear to result in a substantial advantage in terms of CR achievement and duration. An alternative approach to increase FLAG activity might be the addition of investigational drugs with novel mechanism of action, such as topoiromerase I inhibitors. The addition of anthracyclines to induction therapy does not appear to result in a substantial advantage in terms of CR achievement and duration. Clinical studies have confirmed the efficacy of PNA alone or in combination protocols in the treatment of AML. These regimens seem to produce superior results with acceptable toxicities in previously treated and relapsed, poor risk AML. However, early relapses remain a significant problem in a majority of refractory or relapsed patients in CR after treatment with PNA based regimens. To prolong remission duration or even cure AML, auto--or allo stem cell transplantation should be considered. However, FAMP or 2-CdA containing regimens may impair mobilization and collection of stem cells from peripheral blood for autotransplantation. Few studies have analyzed the role of PNA in CML. 2-CdA, FAMP and DCF can induce hematologic response in chronic phase of CML but cytogenetic responses have not been observed. Preliminary results suggest, that PNA used alone or in combination may be used as palliation in blast phase of the disease. However, currently, the role of these agents in CML is insignificant because of the high activity of Glivec in this disease. Finally, PNA, especially FA play an important role in non-myeloablative conditioning regimens for allogenic stem cell transplantation in high-risk patients, possibly also with myeloid malignancies.","['Robak, Tadeusz']",['Robak T'],"['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, 93-513 Lodz, Pabianicka 62 Poland. robaktad@csk.am.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cladribine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pentostatin/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Remission Induction', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",128,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000035608 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):391-409. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000035608.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'FLAG protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An absolute CD8+ lymphocytosis correlates with disease progression and low expression of CD4 and CD8 (as found in autoimmune disease) is seen with abnormal expression of other surface molecules. Although the expression of T cell surface activation markers, CD25 and CD152, may be increased on culture in B-CLL serum, response to the common mitogens, PHA and PWM, is reduced. This and the excess of CD8 cells may explain partly the variable cooperation of T cells with B cell production of immunoglobulin in B-CLL. In the context of T cell cross-talk with antigen presenting cells, B-CLL B cells are poor antigen presenters. But the T cells themselves have significant abnormalities of expression of the many antigens and ligands necessary for this process. In particular, they exhibit variable expression of the low affinity and non-specific adhesion molecules LFA-1 and ICAM-1, variable, clonally restricted and skewed expression of the TCR repertoire (implying repeated antigenic stimulation possibly by CLL antigens), reduced CD28 and CD152 expression (implying impairment of ability to start or stop an immune response) and reduced IL2 and CD25 (IL2 R) expression (critical for positive feed-back in maintenance and expansion of the T cell response to antigen presentation). Although the production of IL2 and other cytokines by the T cell in B-CLL may be impaired, production of the anti-apoptotic cytokine IL4 is not and there may be a unique and expanded subset of CD8/CD30 cells capable of releasing IL4. The relationship of this T cell subset to the malignant B cell in vivo is unknown. However, T cells which are CD4+/CD152+/CCR4+ migrate selectively in vitro in response to the chemokine CCL22 (specific for the receptor CCR4) produced by the malignant B cells and are always seen amongst the malignant cells in bone marrow and lymph nodes from B-CLL patients. Other abnormalities of cytokine secretion are described. These findings suggest that the T cell in B-CLL may be unable to start, maintain and complete an immune response to the malignant B cell and other antigens and may be involved directly in sustaining the tumour. However, autologous tumour specific cytotoxicity has been shown in vitro and T cells which recognise tumour-derived heavy chain fragments circulate in vivo. If adoptive immunotherapy of any nature is to succeed in B-CLL, manipulation to optimise these CTL responses is needed to overcome the profound and variable T cell dysfunction in this disease.","['Scrivener, S', 'Goddard, R V', 'Kaminski, E R', 'Prentice, A G']","['Scrivener S', 'Goddard RV', 'Kaminski ER', 'Prentice AG']","['Plymouth Post-graduate Medical School, Derriford Combined Laboratories, Derriford Hospital, Plymouth PL6 8DH, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Antibody Formation', 'Antigens, CD/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Cooperation', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology/physiology', 'Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology/metabolism']",80,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000029993 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2003 Mar;44(3):383-9. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000029993.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptor-CD3 Complex, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This stem cell disorder, characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome is dependent on the constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity of the BCR-ABL oncoprotein. A novel promising treatment modality is the selective inhibition of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase, by the Signal Transduction inhibitor (STI 571) imatinib mesylate which may cause a high response rate of clinical and cytogenetic remission and raise hope for a possible cure of disease by drug therapy alone. Combination of imatinib with established or investigational antileukaemic agents may lead to an increased response rate and remission duration.

Any routinely used staging system does not distinguish exactly the probable course of the disease at the time of diagnosis. Therefore the new prognostic factors, which help to assess the optimal therapeutic plan of patients, are searched intensively. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 154 patients with the B-CLL at the time of diagnosis--133 of them were retrospectively divided into two groups--one with stable form and the other with progressive form of the disease. We compared these two groups of patients with some of the prognostic factors (absolute lymphocyte count, the level of C-reactive protein, lactatdehydrogenase, beta-2-microglobulin, tumour necrosis factor, the immunoglobulin levels, the expression of CD38, FMC7, surface immunoglobulins, the type of bone marrow infiltration, and the cytogenetic abnormalities (trisomy 12, del(13)(q14), del(17)(p13) a del(11)(q23)). We found higher absolute lymphocyte count, level of beta-2-mikroglobulin, tumour necrosis factor, expression of CD38, light chains lambda, lower expression of FMC7 and less frequent nodular type of bone marrow infiltration by the patients with progressive disease. The correlation of the cytogenetic abnormalities and the course of the disease or stage according to the RAI et al. [27] staging system were not significant may be due to the small number of evaluated patients and short period of follow up. CONCLUSION: The routine evaluation of some risk factors in patients with B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia at the time of diagnosis helps to distinguish those with the probable more aggressive course of the disease and have the implication for the design of risk-adapted treatment strategies. The prognostic impact of the cytogenetic abnormalities and other risk factors has to be evaluated on larger group of patients during longer follow up period and repeated evaluations.","['Cmunt, E', 'Michalova, K', 'Sindelarova, L', 'Karban, J', 'Zemanova, Z', 'Kurkova, S', 'Brezinova, J', 'Schwarz, J', 'Bosakova, Z']","['Cmunt E', 'Michalova K', 'Sindelarova L', 'Karban J', 'Zemanova Z', 'Kurkova S', 'Brezinova J', 'Schwarz J', 'Bosakova Z']","['I. interni klinika Vseobecne fakultni nemocnice a 1. lekarske fakulty Univerzity Karlovy, U nemocnice 2, 128 08 Praha 2, Czech Republic. cmunt@vfn:cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Sb Lek,Sbornik lekarsky,0025770,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sb Lek. 2002;103(3):359-70.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,Vyznam prognostickych faktoru pacientu s B-chronickou lymfatickou leukemii v dobe diagnozy.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrary to Greenberg's group of the MDS patients there are only three risk-groups in our study: low risk (score 0-0.5), intermediate (1-2) and high risk (> 2); the median survival and the risk of the evolution to the acute leukemia (p = 0.0001) are significantly different.","['Siskova, M', 'Dohnalova, A', 'Neuwirtova, R', 'Penickova, J', 'Karban, J', 'Cmunt, E']","['Siskova M', 'Dohnalova A', 'Neuwirtova R', 'Penickova J', 'Karban J', 'Cmunt E']","['I. interni klinika 1. lekarske fakulty Univerzity Karlovy a Vseobecne fakultni nemocnice, U nemocnice 2, 128 08 Praha 2, Czech Republic. siskova@vfn.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Czech Republic,Sb Lek,Sbornik lekarsky,0025770,IM,"['Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*diagnosis', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Sb Lek. 2002;103(3):333-8.,,,,,,,Mezinarodni prognosticky bodovaci system u pacientu s primarnim myelodysplastickym syndromem.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-six patients have been enrolled into this study (24 ALL and 22 control, nonleukemic cases). The peripheral blood was tested for WT1 gene expression using a sensitive nested RT-PCR technique. The assay was sensitive enough to detect 10(2) leukemic cells among 10(6) normal leukocytes. In agreement with the literature 96% of childhood ALL (23/24) expressed WT1 independent of the prognostic factors of the disease. On the other hand, no WT1 gene expression was found in the peripheral blood of nonleukemic hematological diseases, except myelodysplasia. WT1 became negative in the peripheral blood of these patients at the end of the induction phase of the therapy in the majority of the cases (19/24), whereas clinical remission was achieved in all patients except one. WT1 gene expression changes in the peripheral blood was monthly monitored in 20 ALL patients for 1 year and in 16 cases during the second year (for a maximum of 21 months). Although continuous monitoring detected transient (1- to 3-month long) WT1 expression in the majority of the ALL cases (16/20), clinical relapse occurred in 2 cases only when the WT1 expression was maintained for 11-15 months. Follow up studies of the WT1 gene expression in the peripheral blood of WT1-positive childhood ALL may enable researchers to monitor MRD and detect a very low leukemic cell count (perhaps called ""molecular relapse""). According to this study, the transient WT1 positivity for 1-3 months does not predict clinical relapse of childhood ALL, unlike a longer-lasting positivity.","['Magyarosy, E', 'Varga, N', 'Timar, J', 'Raso, E']","['Magyarosy E', 'Varga N', 'Timar J', 'Raso E']","[""Department of Hematology, Heim Pal Children's Hospital, Budapest, Hungary.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Hungary', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Jan-Feb;20(1):65-74.,,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conditioned media from the cultures (MNC-CM) were collected after stimulation with various concentrations of phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The proliferation-inhibiting and differentiation-inducing activities of the PHA-MNC-CM on U937 cells were evaluated. The growth inhibition activity of uremic patients' PHA-MNC-CM was lower than that of controls. The differentiation-inducing effects were evaluated by morphological scoring, superoxide production, and monocyte-associated antigen expression (CD14 and CD68). All three parameters demonstrated that the differentiation-inducing effect of MNC-CM increased with increasing doses of PHA. These effects, however, were significantly less in uremic patients compared to controls at higher doses of PHA. The levels of TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in PHA-MNC-CM increased in a PHA dose-dependent manner and were much higher in the controls.

The present study showed, that normal PB and BM cells expressed low levels of MDM2. Overexpression of this protein was more frequently found in leukemic cells, namely in samples of patients with advanced, than those in incipient clinical stage of disease at examination. Of the 34 leukemias tested in our laboratory 24 (70%) showed abnormal expression of the MDM2 protein. This include 8/12 (66%) ALL, 10/13 (76%) B-CLL, and 6/9 (66%) AML. Since MDM2 and p53 are functionally related and overexpression of MDM2 can abrogate wild (wt)-p53 tumor suppressive function, we examined simultaneously with MDM2 protein expression also the expression of both wt-p53 and mutant (mt)-p53 with two MoAbs (Ab5 and Pab240). As measured by flow cytometry only a small part of the observed wt-p53 protein was in true wt-conformation (Ab5+), while most was in mt-conformation (Pab240+), which could mean, that most of the p53 protein in the cells was not functional, as in its usual role as a suppressor of the cell cycle. The MDM2 positive cases were negative for p53 (Pab240-) in hematopoietic cells of patients with B- and T-ALL at diagnosis and in relapsed disease. Samples of patients in remission with immunophenotype of normal cells were p53 and MDM2 negative. The expression of Ki67 antigen a nuclear protein associated with cell proliferation was used to verify the proliferative activity of the leukemic cells. Results of the two-color flow cytometric assay, which allows better definition of pathologic cell populations and nuclear fluorescence data for p53, MDM2 or Ki67 on a population of cells expressing only a given surface blast marker, confirmed their coexpression in the same cell. Our preliminary results supported the view that the expression of p53 is very probably involved in the regulation of leukemic hematopoiesis and that the inhibition of p53 expression could modulate the proliferation of leukemic cells. It appears, that MDM2 overexpression, which may be p53-dependent, or also p53-independent plays an important role in leukemogenesis and/or disease progression.","['Konikova, E', 'Kusenda, J']","['Konikova E', 'Kusenda J']","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovak Republic. exonneo@savba.sk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Child', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Ki-67 Antigen/metabolism', 'Leukemia/blood/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/blood/*metabolism']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/07/29 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Neoplasma. 2003;50(1):31-40.,,"['0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A participation of early hemopoietic precursors in immunopathology development was analyzed on the next models: age-related immunodeficiency in CBF1 mice, autoimmune hemolytic anemia in NZB mice and leukemia in AKR mice. NZB mice have an augmented number of CFUs in S-phase, as a prerequisit for elevated sensitivity to Rauscher leukemia virus, as well to autoimmune disorder development. The increased stem cell proliferation (45% of CFUs in S-phase) in AKR mice is accompanied by changes in CFU redistribution: a decrease of CFU number in bone marrow and their increase in spleen. The hallmark of ""disregulation"" in bone marrow of old mice is the augmentation of erythroid precursors and the decrease in the number of myeloid precursors (GM-CFU and M-CFU), in other words the shift of differentiation to erythropoiesis. The augmentation of stem cell proliferation is accompanied by the increase in the number of erythroid precursors to the detriment of myeloid precursors. Therefore, the disturbances in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of CFUs may contribute to the formation of the immunopathologies. The correction of HSC proliferation and differentiation may be one of the important approaches to the treatment of immune disorders.","['Orlovskaya, Irina A.', 'Kozlov, Vladimir A.']","['Orlovskaya IA', 'Kozlov VA']","['Institute of Clinical Immunology, Siberian Branch of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Russia (Federation),Russ J Immunol,Russian journal of immunology : RJI : official journal of Russian Society of Immunology,9713940,,,,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/04/11 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['00601167 [pii]'],ppublish,Russ J Immunol. 2001 Jul;6(2):167-176.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No expression of p104-110 has been found on resting and activated T cells as well as on monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells. FACS analysis of mononuclear cells derived from normal human bone marrow has revealed the presence of p104-110 on committed CD34(-); CD38(+) mononuclear cell subset that composes only the minor part of mature CD20(+) B cells being mostly CD20 negative.

The enhancement of apoptotic activity has been revealed to be the universal mechanism of delayed effect of antileukemic chemotherapy for all the compartments of hemopoiesis, including granulocyte/macrophage precursors. The expression of this phenomenon is decreasing with the time period elapsed after treatment withdrawal. However, approximation analysis shows that the recovery of normal values of blood cell apoptosis occurs not earlier than 8 years after therapy withdrawal. Therein, in should be noted that the numbers of leukocytes don't differ from normal values at all the periods of observation.

It was determined that 88 kDa protein was a highly glycosylated version of 66 kDa protein. Staining blood cells and bone marrow cells with FITC-labelled specific monoclonal antibodies demonstrated that CD34(+) cells produced this peptide.

Specifically, involvement of actin dynamics in the regulation of nonvoltage-gated sodium channels has been shown. Herein, inside-out patch clamp experiments were performed to study the effect of the heterodimeric actin capping protein CapZ on sodium channel regulation in leukemia K562 cells. The channels were activated by cytochalasin-induced disruption of actin filaments and inactivated by G-actin under ionic conditions promoting rapid actin polymerization. CapZ had no direct effect on channel activity. However, being added together with G-actin, CapZ prevented actin-induced channel inactivation, and this effect occurred at CapZ/actin molar ratios from 1:5 to 1:100. When actin was allowed to polymerize at the plasma membrane to induce partial channel inactivation, subsequent addition of CapZ restored the channel activity. These results can be explained by CapZ-induced inhibition of further assembly of actin filaments at the plasma membrane due to the modification of actin dynamics by CapZ. No effect on the channel activity was observed in response to F-actin, confirming that the mechanism of channel inactivation does not involve interaction of the channel with preformed filaments. Our data show that actin-capping protein can participate in the cytoskeleton-associated regulation of sodium transport in nonexcitable cells.","['Shumilina, Ekaterina V', 'Negulyaev, Yuri A', 'Morachevskaya, Elena A', 'Hinssen, Horst', 'Khaitlina, Sofia Yu']","['Shumilina EV', 'Negulyaev YA', 'Morachevskaya EA', 'Hinssen H', 'Khaitlina SY']","['Institute of Cytology Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg 194064, Russia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Biol Cell,Molecular biology of the cell,9201390,IM,"['Actins/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'CapZ Actin Capping Protein', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Ion Transport/drug effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Muscle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sodium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Sodium Channels/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Viscosity']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/06/25 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1091/mbc.e02-09-0622 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Biol Cell. 2003 Apr;14(4):1709-16. doi: 10.1091/mbc.e02-09-0622.,,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (CapZ Actin Capping Protein)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Muscle Proteins)', '0 (Sodium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Sodium Channels)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)']",,PMC153133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ELL is an RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) transcriptional elongation factor that interacts with the recently identified EAF1 protein. Here, we show that ELL and EAF1 are components of Cajal bodies (CBs).

Treatment of cells with actinomycin D, DRB, or alpha-amanitin, specific inhibitors of Pol II, disperses ELL and EAF1 from CBs, indicating that localization of ELL and EAF1 in CBs is dependent on active transcription by Pol II. The concentration of ELL and EAF1 in CBs links the transcriptional elongation activity of ELL to the RNA processing functions previously identified in CBs. Strikingly, CBs are disrupted in MLL-ELL leukemia. EAF1 and p80 coilin are delocalized from CBs in murine MLL-ELL leukemia cells and in HeLa cells transiently transfected with MLL-ELL. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation revealed diminished expression of p80 coilin and EAF1 in the nuclei of MLL-ELL leukemia cells [corrected].

DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive case series study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All NHLs (nodal and extra nodal) diagnosed between January 1991-December 2001 in the section of Histopathology, Department of Pathology, The Aga Khan University, Karachi were retrieved by using SNOMED coding system. Cases were reviewed and those presenting with skin involvement were selected. Further characterization of these tumours was done by morphology and Immunohistochemistry. Panel of antibodies included leukocyte common antigen (CD45), Pan B markers (CD20 and CD 79a), Pan T markers(UCHL1), Ki-1(CD30) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). RESULTS: The total number of NHLs (nodal and extra nodal) diagnosed in our department during the study period of 10 years were 1610. Out of these, 133 cases (8.26%) of NHLs presented with skin involvement. Out of these 44.4% (n=59) were NHLs of B cell phenotype while 23.3% (n=31) cases were of T cell phenotype. Out of 133 cases, 14(10.5%) were of mycosis fungoides (MF), and 3 (2%) each were of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL:Ki-1), lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia. In 17.3% (n=23) cases the phenotype could not be ascertained. There were 97(73%) males and 36(27%) females with a M:F ratio of 2.7:1. All types of NHLs showed a site predilection for the head and neck region except MF which presented mainly as generalized body lesions. CONCLUSION: NHLs presenting as skin lesions are more commonly of B cell phenotype followed by T cell phenotype (NOS) and mycosis fungoides. Probable reasons for the high frequency of cutaneous involvement by B-cell NHL are the advanced nature of the disease at the time of presentation and biological behavior of the tumors in our population.","['Yaqoob, Nausheen', 'Noorali, Samina', 'Nasir, Muhammad Israr', 'Pervez, Shahid']","['Yaqoob N', 'Noorali S', 'Nasir MI', 'Pervez S']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Health Sciences, The Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. nausheen.yaqoob@aku.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,9606447,IM,"['Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Mycosis Fungoides/diagnosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Skin Diseases/*diagnosis']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2002/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']","['01.2003/JCPSP.2932 [doi]', '040579197 [pii]']",ppublish,J Coll Physicians Surg Pak. 2003 Jan;13(1):29-32. doi: 01.2003/JCPSP.2932.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It functions as a tumor suppressor protein. p14ARF suppresses growth through p53-dependent and p53-independent pathways. RESULTS: p14ARF protein localizes primarily to the nucleoli. Here we show that in transfected cells p14ARF also appears in Hsp70 positive extranucleolar inclusions. The formation of p14ARF inclusions induces the parallel re-localization p53 and HDM2 to these sites that are also targeted by PML bodies and proteasomes. CONCLUSION: Our data show that co-localization between p53, HDM2 and p14ARF occurs at extranucleolar sites. Accumulation of PML and proteasomes at these sites suggest that the components of the nuclear inclusions are targeted for proteasome-mediated degradation.","['Kashuba, Elena', 'Mattsson, Karin', 'Klein, George', 'Szekely, Laszlo']","['Kashuba E', 'Mattsson K', 'Klein G', 'Szekely L']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center (MTC), Karolinska Institute, S 171 77, Stockholm, Sweden.

Although hypercoagulability and thrombosis are well-described phenomena in solid tumors and in myeloproliferative neoplasms, CLL is generally not associated with an acquired coagulopathy.

To examine this proposition, further, we have screened samples from 79 AML patients for mutations in the major FA gene, FANCA. No truncating FANCA mutations were detected.

Cellular drug resistance might be one of the reasons of therapy failure in AML. The aim of the study was the analysis of ex vivo drug resistance profile in childhood initial and relapsed AML in comparison to initial ALL. Fifty-three AML samples were tested for chemosensitivity and results were compared with those of 106 initial ALL samples. Ex vivo drug resistance was tested by means of the MTT assay. Up to 29 cytotoxic drugs were tested for each patient. When compared to de nova ALL samples, myeloblasts from initial AML samples were significantly more resistant to most tested drugs, except cytarabine, mercaptopurine and thioguanine. Relapsed AML samples, in relation to initial AML samples, showed comparable sensitivity to cytarabine, idarubicin, fludarabine and cladribine. Patients, who have died due to refractory or relapsing disease, were already on first diagnosis 2-fold more resistant to cytarabine, 6.4-fold more resistant to cisplatin and 3-fold more resistant to carboplatin, when compared to those who stay in remission. Resistance to prednisolone was observed in 85% initial and all relapsed AML samples, in comparison to 33% of ALL samples. Resistance to cytarabine occurred in 2.1% of ALL and 12% of AML cases while a patient with Down syndrome presented the most sensitive drug resistance profile. In conclusion this study shows that no drug was found which, on average, was more effective in AML than in ALL samples.

B-cell CLL cells are known to be resistant to killing by anticancer and other agents. This resistance is associated with alterations in apoptosis and cell cycle regulated genes. In our earlier studies, we have demonstrated that CLL cells have differential expression of genes that are associated with apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, including elevated expression of Bcl-2, DAD-1, Cyclin D3 and cyclin dependent kinase 4 inhibitor. Therefore, in this study, in an attempt to study the role of Cyclin D3 in the resistant behavior of CLL cells, Cyclin D3 was down regulated using antisense oligonucleotide (AS-ODN) in WSU-CLL, a human CLL cell line. The down regulation of Cyclin D3 was confirmed by RT-PCR and flow cytometry techniques. The Cyclin D3 expression down-regulated WSU-CLL cells were then tested for their susceptibility to fludarabine, a chemotherapeutic agent. Our results showed that the Cyclin D3 expression down-regulated WSU-CLL cells were more susceptible to fludarabine mediated killing. Following treatment with fludarabine, there was a significant increase in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis in Cyclin D3 expression down-regulated WSU-CLL cells as determined by Annexin-V assay, cell cycle analysis for DNA content, and cytomorphology. Thus, our results indicate Cyclin D3 down regulation increases the killing of WSU-CLL cells with fludarabine by increasing the number of cells undergoing apoptosis.","['Wang, Peng', 'Pavletic, Z Steven', 'Joshi, Shantaram S']","['Wang P', 'Pavletic ZS', 'Joshi SS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6395, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Annexin A5/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Coloring Agents/pharmacology', 'Cyclin D3', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cyclins/*biosynthesis/metabolism', '*Down-Regulation', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tetrazolium Salts/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000006411 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Sep;43(9):1827-35. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000006411.,,"['0 (Annexin A5)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (CCND3 protein, human)', '0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Cyclin D3)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Dad-1 protein, C elegans)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK4 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To define the natural history of fludarabine (Fludara) refractory patients with CLL, we reviewed the response to first salvage therapy of 147 patients who were refractory to Fludara or had a remission less than six months in duration after a Fludara-containing regimen. Thirty-three (22%) patients responded to their first salvage attempt. However, the median survival was only 10 months. Responders survived significantly longer than non-responders. The most effective salvage regimens were combinations of purine analogs and cyclophosphamide. Patients still possibly sensitive to alkylating agents had a superior response than alkylating agent resistant or naive patients. Subsequent salvage therapy was administered to 61 patients. The most promising results noted in the group were transplantation and the use of Campath-1H antibody. The major morbidity and cause of death were associated with infections. The probability of infection was most strongly associated with the response to salvage therapy. Gram-positive organisms were most commonly associated with infection. However, gram-negative bacilli or opportunistic infection such as fungi, Pneumocystis carinii, acid-fast bacilli and legionella were prominent causes of infection. Fludara-refractory patients are a poor prognosis group and need more effective therapeutic regimens and well-designed infection prophylactic regimens.","['Keating, M J', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Kontoyiannis, D', 'Plunkett, W', 'Koller, C', 'Beran, M', 'Lerner, S', 'Kantarjian, H']","['Keating MJ', ""O'Brien S"", 'Kontoyiannis D', 'Plunkett W', 'Koller C', 'Beran M', 'Lerner S', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd., Box 61, Houston, TX 77030, USA. mkeating@mdanderson.org']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/1042819021000006547 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2002 Sep;43(9):1755-62. doi: 10.1080/1042819021000006547.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median numbers of colonies derived from cytokine-stimulated BMMCs significantly differed between patients with favorable karyotypes (2/10(6)), intermediate cytogenetics (12/10(6)) and unfavorable abnormalities (51.5/10(6)). Colony growth in the absence of stimulatory cytokines was assessed in 113 patients. Individuals with unfavorable karyotypes exhibited significantly more often partial or full autonomous growth in vitro when compared to the intermediate and favorable prognostic group. Median stimulated colony growth of patients who entered complete remission (CR) was 9/10(6) BMMCs compared with 63 in patients with no response. Both, cytokine-stimulated as well as autonomous colony formation, significantly discriminated between patients regarding survival. However, multiple regression analysis revealed cytogenetic risk groups as the most important predictor for achieving CR, with colony growth adding no additional prognostic information.

We must consider novel therapeutic drugs against other AML to develop a differentiation therapy for leukemia. Regulators that play an important role in the differentiation and development of plants may also affect the differentiation of human leukemia cells through a common signal transduction system, and might be clinically useful for treating AML. Cytokinins are important purine derivatives that serve as hormones that control many processes in plants. Cytokinins such as kinetin, isopentenyladenine (IPA) and benzyladenine were very effective at inducing nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and morphological changes in human myeloid leukemia cells into mature granulocytes. On the other hand, cytokinin ribosides such as kinetin riboside, isopentenyladenosine (IPAR) and benzyladenine riboside were the most potent for inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis. When the cells were incubated with cytokinin ribosides in the presence of an O2- scavenger, antioxidant or caspase inhibitor, apoptosis was significantly reduced and differentiation was greatly enhanced. These results suggest that both cytokinins and cytokinin ribosides can induce the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, but cytokinin ribosides also induce apoptosis prior to differentiation. Cotylenin A has been isolated as a plant growth regulator exhibits cytokinin-like activity. Although it has a different structure than cytokinins, it also induces the differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.

Prevalence of BLV in this herd was 0.807. Predictive value of a positive test was 1.00, and predictive value of a negative test was 0.421. The percentage of cows correctly classified by PCR assay was 73.5%. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A positive PCR assay result provided definitive evidence that a cow was infected with BLV. Sensitivity and negative predictive value for PCR assay were low. Consequently, PCR assay alone is unreliable for routine detection of BLV in herds with high prevalence of the disease.","['Nagy, Dusty W', 'Tyler, Jeff W', 'Kleiboeker, Steven B', 'Stoker, Aaron']","['Nagy DW', 'Tyler JW', 'Kleiboeker SB', 'Stoker A']","['Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61802, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Am Vet Med Assoc,Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,7503067,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/blood/isolation & purification', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/*diagnosis/epidemiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/veterinary', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods/*veterinary', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/04/11 05:00,2003/06/06 05:00,['2003/04/11 05:00'],"['2003/04/11 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/javma.2003.222.983 [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Vet Med Assoc. 2003 Apr 1;222(7):983-5. doi: 10.2460/javma.2003.222.983.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Woburn has a 130-year industrial history that resulted in significant local deposition of tannery and chemical manufacturing waste. In 1979, two of the city's eight municipal drinking water wells were closed when tests identified contamination with solvents including trichloroethylene. By 1986, 21 childhood leukemia cases had been observed (5.52 expected during the seventeen year period) and the case-control investigation discussed herein was begun. Nineteen cases and 37 matched controls comprised the study population. A water distribution model provided contaminated public water exposure estimates for subject residences. Results identified a non-significant association between potential for exposure to contaminated water during maternal pregnancy and leukemia diagnosis, (odds ratio = 8.33, 95% CI 0.73-94.67). However, a significant dose-response relationship (P < 0.05) was identified for this exposure period. In contrast, the child's potential for exposure from birth to diagnosis showed no association with leukemia risk. Wide confidence intervals suggest cautious interpretation of association magnitudes.

They complicate approximately 1 per 1000 pregnancies. The most common malignancies associated with pregnancy include malignant melanoma, malignant lymphomas and leukemia, and cancer of the cervix, breast, ovary, colon and thyroid. Since it is impossible for prospective randomized clinical trials to be conducted in this field, relevant data have been generated from case reports and matched historical cohort studies in order to evaluate the treatment outcomes and the issues complicating the management of malignancy in the pregnant patient. There is almost always a conflict between optimal maternal therapy and fetal well-being. The maternal interest is for an immediate treatment of the recently diagnosed tumor. However, the optimal therapy, be it chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery, may impose great risks on the fetus. Consequently, either maternal or fetal health, or both, will be compromised. Therefore, both the pregnant patient and her physician are often in a dilemma as to the optimal course. On the basis of the medical facts, we discuss the issues raising potential ethical conflicts and present a practical ethical approach which may help to increase clarity in maternal-fetal conflicts. We review the available data informing the incidence and impact of the most common malignancies during pregnancy and their treatment on both the pregnant woman and her fetus. The optimal therapy for the tragic diagnosis of cancer in pregnancy requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach between gynecologists, oncologists, obstetricians, surgeons, neonatologists, psychologists, nursing staff and other disciplines. The purpose of this article is not to answer specific questions or to construct management schemes for specific tumors but to provide a framework for approaching some of these complex issues.","['Oduncu, F S', 'Kimmig, R', 'Hepp, H', 'Emmerich, B']","['Oduncu FS', 'Kimmig R', 'Hepp H', 'Emmerich B']",,['eng'],['Editorial'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/pathology/therapy', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Maternal-Fetal Relations', 'Melanoma/pathology/therapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/*pathology/therapy', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/pathology/therapy']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2002/05/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/11/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00432-002-0406-6 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2003 Mar;129(3):133-46. doi: 10.1007/s00432-002-0406-6.

In this study, the differential effects of oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor on cell survival and decidualization of normal human endometrial stromal cells were investigated by using 8-Br-cAMP-induced decidualization assay. Oncostatin M did not affect the viable cell numbers or the prolactin release of unstimulated stromal cells. However, oncostatin M dose-dependently suppressed prolactin releases from 8-Br-cAMP-stimulating stromal cells but enhanced their viable cell numbers. Although oncostatin M significantly enhanced viable cell numbers of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated stromal cells, it did not affect prolactin secretion from 8-Br-cAMP-induced decidualized cells. Leukemia inhibitory factor significantly enhanced viable cell numbers of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulating cells in a dose-dependent manner as did oncostatin M, while leukemia inhibitory factor did not show any significant suppression of PRL secretion from 8-Br-cAMP-stimulating cells. These results indicate that oncostatin M inhibits the 8-Br-cAMP-induced decidualization process via oncostatin M-specific receptors and that oncostatin M and leukemia inhibitory factor enhance cell survival of 8-Br-cAMP-stimulated prolactin-non-secreting stromal cells mainly via leukemia inhibitory factor receptors. Thus, oncostatin M may autoregulate human endometrial stromal cell survival and decidualization in a paracrine manner.","['Tanaka, Tetsuji', 'Umesaki, Naohiko']","['Tanaka T', 'Umesaki N']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Wakayama Medical University, Japan. tetanaka@wakayama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,IM,"['8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endometrium/*cytology/*drug effects/physiology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/*pharmacology', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/*metabolism']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2003 May;11(5):627-30.,,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', '23583-48-4 (8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of caspase-3/7 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO on IDA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 and Jurkat cells. Ac-DEVD-CHO abolished IDA-induced caspases-3/7 activation in both cell lines. We have also found that L-carnitine can inhibit recombinant caspase-3 activity in vitro. L-carnitine treatment prevented IDA-induced caspases-3/7 activation in both cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.

The G1 arrest of U937 cells and U937/Bcl-2 cells induced by treatment with 20 nM PMA is associated with cyclin A down-regulation and accumulation of p21, cdks inhibitor. However, PMA had no effect on the levels of cyclin A expression and p21 expression under the same conditions of time and concentration of PMA in the R-U937 cells. Treatment with 20 nM PMA for 24 h produced morphological features of apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in U937 and U937/Bcl-2 cells, but not in R-U937 cells. This was associated with the caspase 3 activation and cyctochrome c release. R-U937 cells exhibited less cytochrome c release and sustained phosphorylation level of Akt during PMA-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that R-U937 cells are resistant to PMA-induced apoptosis by a mechanism of the signaling defect in the activation of the caspase 3 that is involved in the execution of apoptosis.","['Hah, Jeong-Ok', 'Lee, Kyung-Ah', 'Choi, Yun Jung', 'Kim, Won-Duck', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Hah JO', 'Lee KA', 'Choi YJ', 'Kim WD', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yeungnam University Medical Center, Taegu, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transfection', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/08/12 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2003 May;22(5):1111-6.,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In OCI/AML-6 cells, Delta proteins suppressed the growth and self-renewal capacity while inducing differentiation into macrophage-like cells. We additionally found that Notch ligands needed to be immobilized on culture wells to affect the cells.

We studied in vitro effects of As2O3 at low concentrations (1.0-2.0 microM) on two human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, HL-60, an acute myeloid leukemia cell line, and RL, a B-cell lymphoma cell line. As2O3 inhibited proliferation of HL-60 cells and RL cells to the similar degree to the reported inhibition by an APL cell line, NB4. As2O3-treated cell lines exhibited typical morphologic changes of apoptosis such as nuclear condensation and apoptotic bodies, and a cell cycle arrest at the subG1 phase. As2O3-treated cell lines also showed upregulation of CD95/CD95L expression and activation of caspases 8 and 3. Treatment of these cells with anti-CD95 antibodies capable of blocking the CD95 signaling pathway ameliorated As2O3-induced apoptosis. These data suggest that As2O3 can inhibit growth of leukemia/lymphoma cells by inducing the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis that is partially mediated by the CD95/CD95L system.","['Zhu, Jiebin', 'Okumura, Hirokazu', 'Ohtake, Shigeki', 'Nakamura, Shinobu', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Zhu J', 'Okumura H', 'Ohtake S', 'Nakamura S', 'Nakao S']","['Cellular Transplantation Biology, Kanazawa University Graduate School of Medical Science, Takara-machi 13-1, Kanazawa 920-8641, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Leukemia/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/12/19 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2003 May-Jun;10(3):705-9.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the pathogenesis of this disease is not entirely understood, altered apoptosis is believed to play a relevant role in B-CLL. In this study, we compared the expression of CD95, the best characterized surface molecule involved in triggering the apoptotic machinery, on normal and CLL B cells before and after in vitro activation with polyclonal stimulators. Cell activation was monitored by verifying the induced expression of the early activation antigen CD69. Freshly analyzed CLL B cells showed significantly lower levels of CD95 than normal B cells. Moreover, following in vitro culture with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) + ionomycin, phytohemagglutinin, or pokeweed mitogen, CLL B cells failed to upregulate CD95 expression as efficiently as normal B cells. Impairment of CD95 upregulation was mainly observed following PMA + ionomycin treatment. In contrast, CLL B cells were shown to express CD69 as well as normal B cells, regardless of the activator used, indicating that CLL B cells retain the ability to respond to activating stimuli but are unable to efficiently implement the CD95-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) program. In conclusion, these results suggest that prolonged survival of CLL B cells may be contributed to by alterations in AICD mechanisms.","['De Fanis, Umberto', 'Romano, Ciro', 'Dalla Mora, Liliana', 'Sellitto, Ausilia', 'Guastafierro, Salvatore', 'Tirelli, Angelo', 'Bresciano, Elio', 'Giunta, Riccardo', 'Lucivero, Giacomo']","['De Fanis U', 'Romano C', 'Dalla Mora L', 'Sellitto A', 'Guastafierro S', 'Tirelli A', 'Bresciano E', 'Giunta R', 'Lucivero G']","['Division of Internal Medicine and Immunoallergology, Department of Gerontology, Geriatrics and Metabolic Diseases, The Second University of Naples School of Medicine, Piazza Luigi Miraglia 3, I-80138 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Oncol Rep,Oncology reports,9422756,IM,"['Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Ionophores/pharmacology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Up-Regulation', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/12/19 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncol Rep. 2003 May-Jun;10(3):653-8.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD69 antigen)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ionophores)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that Aplidine at nM concentrations (10-100 nM) induced apoptosis in human leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cell cultures from leukemic patients. Inhibition of the Fas (CD95)/Fas ligand (CD95L) signaling pathway with an antagonistic anti-Fas antibody partially inhibited Aplidine-induced apoptosis. L929 cells were resistant to Aplidine action but underwent apoptosis after transfection with human Fas cDNA. Aplidine induced a rapid and sustained c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation, and pretreatment with curcumin or SP600125 inhibited Aplidine-induced c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase activation and apoptosis. However, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 kinase signaling pathways did not affect Aplidine-induced apoptosis. Aplidine induced caspase-3 activation, and caspase inhibition prevented Aplidine-induced apoptosis. Aplidine failed to induce apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, defective in caspase-3, additionally implicating caspase-3 in its proapoptotic action. Aplidine also triggered an early release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and overexpression of bcl-2 by gene transfer abrogated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Aplidine rapidly induced cleavage of Bid, a mediator that connects the Fas/CD95 cell death receptor to the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Primary cultures of normal human cells, including hepatocytes and resting peripheral blood lymphocytes, were spared or weakly affected after Aplidine treatment. Nevertheless, mitogen (phytohemagglutinin/interleukin-2)-activated T lymphocytes resulted sensitively to the apoptotic action of Aplidine. Thus, Aplidine is an extremely potent and rapid apoptotic inducer on leukemic cells that triggers Fas/CD95- and mitochondrial-mediated apoptotic signaling routes, and shows a rather selective apoptotic action on cancer cells and activated T cells.","['Gajate, Consuelo', 'An, Feiyun', 'Mollinedo, Faustino']","['Gajate C', 'An F', 'Mollinedo F']","['Centro de Investigacion del Cancer, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas-Universidad de Salamanca, Campus Miguel de Unamuno, E-37007 Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Anthracenes/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Curcumin/pharmacology', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', '*Depsipeptides', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', '*JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Protein Transport', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1535-45.,,"['0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'Y76ID234HW (plitidepsin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, these aberrations are of clinical and biological importance. We identified 58 cases with secondary abnormalities in addition to t(9;22)(q34;q11.2) or its variants in a review of 137 CML patients treated with imatinib mesylate (STI571). Clinically 13 patients were in chronic phase, 24 in accelerated phase, and 21 in blastic phase. RESULTS: More than 50% of cases showed the major routes of CML clonal evolution [+8, i(17q), +Ph, and/or +19]. The remainder exhibited minor routes of secondary abnormalities with -17/17p-, 11p-/rearr(11p), and -7/rearr(7) as the most frequent abnormalities. Of particular interest, one case developed an inv(16)(p13q22) as a secondary anomaly during blastic transformation. The bone marrow was consistent with myelomonocytic morphology with eosinophilia. Cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate occurred in 15 of 58 (26%) patients; 12 achieved complete cytogenetic remission, 2 had a major response, and 1 had a minor response, with most responses noted within 3-6 months. Seven patients remain in remission >17-30 months, 2 patients relapsed between 12 and 19 months on therapy, and 1 patient was treated by bone marrow transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Although some Ph+ CML patients with clonal evolution can have a complete cytogenetic response to imatinib mesylate, responses tend to be brief, and such patients may benefit from subsequent stem cell transplantation. Therefore, CML patients with clonal evolution may require therapy additional to imatinib mesylate for maximal eradication of the Ph+ leukemic cells.","['Mohamed, Anwar N', 'Pemberton, Pamela', 'Zonder, Jeffrey', 'Schiffer, Charles A']","['Mohamed AN', 'Pemberton P', 'Zonder J', 'Schiffer CA']","['Department of Pathology and the Division of Hematology/Oncology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. anwar_mohamed@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1333-7.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1248-52.

However, STI571 is only transiently effective in blast crisis, and drug resistance emerges by amplification of or development of mutational changes in Bcr-abl. We have screened a family of TK inhibitors of the pyrido [2,3-d]pyrimidine class, unrelated to STI571, and describe here a compound with substantial activity against STI-resistant mutant Bcr-abl proteins. This compound, PD166326, is a dual specificity TK inhibitor and inhibits src and abl in vitro with IC(50)s of 6 and 8 nM respectively. PD166326 inhibits the growth of K562 cells with IC(50) of 300 pM, leading to apoptotic G(1) arrest, whereas non-Bcr-abl cell types require >1000 times higher concentrations. We tested the effects of PD166326 on two of the clinically observed STI571-resistant Bcr-abl mutants. PD166326 potently inhibits the E255K mutant Bcr-abl protein and the growth of Bcr-ablE255K-driven cells. The T315I mutant Bcr-abl protein, which is mutated within the ATP-binding pocket, is resistant to PD166326; however, the growth of Bcr-ablT315I-driven cells is partially sensitive to this compound, likely through the inhibition of Bcr-abl effector pathways. These findings show that TK drug resistance is a structure-specific phenomenon and can be overcome by TK inhibitors of other structural classes, suggesting new approaches for future anticancer drug development. PD166326 is a prototype of a new generation of anti-Bcr-abl compounds with picomolar potency and substantial activity against STI571-resistant mutants.","['Huron, David R', 'Gorre, Mercedes E', 'Kraker, Alan J', 'Sawyers, Charles L', 'Rosen, Neal', 'Moasser, Mark M']","['Huron DR', 'Gorre ME', 'Kraker AJ', 'Sawyers CL', 'Rosen N', 'Moasser MM']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Program in Pharmacology, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', '*Mutation', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2004/01/21 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1267-73.,['GM07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (PD 166326)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,['Clin Cancer Res. 2003 Apr;9(4):1233-4.

The mechanism by which curcumin initiates apoptosis remains poorly understood. In the present report we investigated the effect of curcumin on the activation of the apoptotic pathway in human leukemia U937 cells. Curcumin induces apoptosis in U937 cells via a mechanism that appears to involve down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL, and IAP proteins, release of cytochrome c, and activation of caspase 3. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of mitochondrial uniporter, specifically inhibits curcumin-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Cotreatment with ruthenium red markedly prevented the activation of caspase 3, cytochrome c release, and cell death, suggesting a role for intracellular Ca(2+) in this process. Curcumin induced a marked depletion of [Ca(2+)](i) in Caki cells bathed with both Ca(2+)-containing and -free solutions. Thapsigargin (TG), cyclopiazonic acid (CPA), and dantolene (DAN) had no effect. Ruthenium red, an inhibitor of mitochondrial uniporter, only attenuated the curcumin-induced [Ca(2+)](i) depletion in a dose-dependent manner. These data indicate that curcumin acts as a stimulator of intracellular Ca(2+) uptake into mitochondria via uniporter pathway and may involve in the execution of apoptosis.","['Bae, Jae Hoon', 'Park, Jong-Wook', 'Kwon, Taeg Kyu']","['Bae JH', 'Park JW', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, 194 DongSan-Dong, Jung-Gu, Taegu 700-712, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Calcium/analysis', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/*pharmacology', 'Calcium Channels', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Curcumin/*pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/chemistry', 'Cytoprotection', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Ruthenium Red/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/05/30 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X03004790 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00479-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Apr 18;303(4):1073-9. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00479-0.,,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (mitochondrial calcium uniporter)', '11103-72-3 (Ruthenium Red)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, the 20S proteasome was purified from WEHI-3B D(+) cells and the effects of LiCl on chymotrypsin-like (Chtl) activity and peptidyl-glutamyl peptide hydrolyzing (PGPH) activity were determined. LiCl functions to inactivate both proteasomal activities in a time-dependent manner, without affecting non-proteasomal proteases. The half-lives for inactivation of Chtl and PGPH hydrolyzing activities were approximately 23 and 36min, respectively, at 10mM LiCl. Both SDS and peptide substrate increased the rate of inactivation. Partial enzymatic activity was recovered after dialysis in the absence of SDS, indicating that the off-rate for lithium was extremely slow. The findings suggest that the inactivation of Chtl and PGPH activities by LiCl occurs through a proteasomal conformational change.","['Holtz, Kathleen M', 'Rice, Anna M', 'Sartorelli, Alan C']","['Holtz KM', 'Rice AM', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Chymotrypsin/metabolism', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*drug effects/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Lithium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*drug effects/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/10 05:00,2003/05/30 05:00,['2003/04/10 05:00'],"['2003/04/10 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/10 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006291X0300473X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00473-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2003 Apr 18;303(4):1058-64. doi: 10.1016/s0006-291x(03)00473-x.,['CA-02817/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'G4962QA067 (Lithium Chloride)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The neuroendocrine tumor was present as nodules that replaced approximately 15% of the bone marrow medullary space and was composed of round cells with fine chromatin, indistinct nucleoli, and relatively abundant, granular, eosinophilic cytoplasm. Histochemical stains showed cytoplasmic reactivity with Grimelius and Fontana-Masson stains, and immunohistochemical studies showed positivity for keratin and chromogranin. The histologic, cytochemical, and immunohistochemical features resembled a carcinoid tumor, and metastasis to the bone marrow was considered initially. The patient was asymptomatic without diarrhea, flushing, or cardiac valve disease. Serotonin production, assessed by the measurement of serum 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and substance P levels, was normal. Extensive clinical and radiologic work-up and endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract to detect a primary site other than the bone marrow were negative. Follow-up bone marrow biopsy 7 years after the initial diagnosis was positive for persistent neuroendocrine tumor. The patient has not received any therapy specific for the neuroendocrine tumor and has had no clinical symptoms or evidence of progression after 9 years of clinical follow-up.

Because MLV replication proceeds through an RNA genome that is generated under the control of viral enhancer and promoter elements, vectors were developed that delete such elements during transduction to reduce the generation of replication-competent virus. It was shown recently that replication of amphotropic MLV in certain human cells is possible without the 75 bp transcription enhancers. It is now demonstrated that enhancer-independent replication requires functional elements within U3 and is repressed by an extended deletion in the U3 region comprising enhancers, promoter and flanking sequences.

IF may also present de novo. To date, treatment strategies for both spent-phase PV and IF have frustrated both clinicians and patients, with little clear progress made over the past 50 years. Treatment modalities with some benefit in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), such as interferon (IFN), have been used to shrink the massive organomegaly seen in these patients and to improve their marrow function, but are not curative, and not all patients respond or can tolerate the agent. A curative approach is allogeneic peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The preparative regimens used in fully ablative techniques rule out older patients for consideration, and many younger patients with good prognostic criteria may do sufficiently well on medical treatment or observation to avoid transplantation. Older patients may have the option to undergo a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplant using a reduced intensity preparative regimen in order to minimize peritransplant mortality. Thus a prerequisite to the broad use of transplantation is objective determination of candidacy. Several evaluation methods agree that anemia, age, and cytogenetic abnormalities all predict poor survival in IF, suggesting that patients with anemia and an abnormal karyotype are the prime candidates for allogeneic transplantation. Experimental peripheral blood models that may reflect the degree of marrow fibrosis, such as the serum procollagen 3 peptide assay, have been used to determine if they are more informative of patient status than a single, random bone marrow sampling. Marrow fibrosis may be patchy, and thus a marrow biopsy alone without other data about marrow function may be misleading. Considerable long-term success in eradicating fibrosis and restoring normal cytogenetics, normal bone marrow morphology, and normal complete blood cell counts through transplantation has been reported. Many questions remain to be answered, however, before the appropriate role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the setting of both spent-phase PV and IF can be determined.","['Fruchtman, Steven M']",['Fruchtman SM'],"['Division of Hematology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, One Gustave L.

Recently, three phase II studies of imatinib mesylate (STI571), a new inhibitor specific for tyrosine kinase of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein, have been reported. They led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve use of this agent to treat CML patients following failure of or withdrawal from IFN-alpha.

With the cloning and characterization of thrombopoietin (TPO) our understanding of the generation of megakaryocytes and platelets has advanced steadily. One of the unexpected properties of TPO is its effect on hematopoietic stem cells: genetic elimination of the cytokine or its receptor reduces stem cell numbers by seven- to eightfold. A corollary of this finding is that TPO or the c-Mpl receptor is a candidate for involvement in the genesis of chronic myeloproliferative diseases (MPD), disorders of hematopoietic stem cells. Evidence has accumulated that dysregulation of growth factors such as TPO and/or impaired expression of its receptor may be leukemogenic and myelofibrogenic, and will be reviewed. Moreover, the expression of c-Mpl in multiple pathologic states is under investigation as potential means of improving the diagnosis of chronic MPDs. Thus, TPO and Mpl may prove to be effective targets for both diagnosis and therapeutic management of MPD.","['Kaushansky, Kenneth']",['Kaushansky K'],"['Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego Medical Center, San Diego, CA 92103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*blood/etiology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/blood', 'Receptors, Cytokine/blood', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/complications/genetics', 'Thrombopoietin/*blood/therapeutic use']",36,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50027 [doi]', 'S0037196303500166 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Jan;40(1 Suppl 1):6-9. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50027.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Diagnosis is largely clinical with assistance from conventional laboratory techniques. Although the sine qua non of PV is erythrocytosis, survey data indicate that approximately 22% of American Society of Hematology members diagnose PV without the benefit of red blood cell mass and plasma volume measurements. These tests are essential in any suspected case of PV because erythrocytosis can be masked by an elevated plasma volume in this disorder. Recognition of defective platelet thrombopoietin receptor (Mpl) expression and overexpression of the PRV-1 gene in PV neutrophils has led to studies demonstrating the potential use of these molecular abnormalities as diagnostic markers for PV and for risk-stratifying patients with ET for disease conversion to PV or IMF. Enumeration of peripheral blood CD34(+) cells may prove useful in the diagnosis of IMF if current data regarding the disease-related specificity of this measurement are validated prospectively in larger numbers of patients.","['Spivak, Jerry L']",['Spivak JL'],"['Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Hematology Division, Traylor 924, 720 Rutland Ave, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/therapy', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/therapy', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/therapy', 'Thrombocytosis/diagnosis/therapy']",15,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/11/08 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/shem.2003.50026 [doi]', 'S0037196303500154 [pii]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2003 Jan;40(1 Suppl 1):1-5. doi: 10.1053/shem.2003.50026.,,['0 (Biomarkers)'],,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Here we use high-resolution mapping in genetically heterogeneous mice to show that a quantitative trait locus influencing conditioned fear can be separated from loci influencing open-field activity. Mapping in two different heterogeneous stocks, the Boulder and Northport HS, gave similar map locations for open-field activity at two positions on the current mouse physical map, one at 162 Mb on chromosome one (negative log P-value 5.4) the other at 173 Mb (negative log P-value 4.8), while mapping of contextual conditioned fear in the Boulder HS identified a locus at 170 Mb (negative log P-value 5.4).

In order for this technique to gain wide applicability, it is critically important to establish a uniform method for normalization of RNA input. In this study, we have determined the best method to quantify the RNA/cDNA input per reaction and searched for the most useful endogenous control genes for normalization of the measurements, based on their abundance and lowest variability between different types of lymphoid cells. To accomplish these aims, we have analyzed the RNA expression of 11 potential endogenous control genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, peptidylprolyl isomerase A, beta 2 microglobulin, protein kinase cGMP-dependent, type I, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1, TATA box binding protein, transferrin receptor, large ribosomal protein, beta-glucoronidase and 18S ribosomal RNA). In all, 12 different B- and T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines, 80 B- and T-cell NHL specimens, and resting and activated normal B and T lymphocytes were screened. Normalization of the nucleic acid input by spectrophotometric OD(260) measurement of RNA proved more reliable than spectrophotometric or fluorometric measurements of cDNA or than electrophoretic estimation of the ribosomal and mRNA fractions. The protein kinase cGMP-dependent, type I (PRKG1) and the TBP genes were expressed at common abundance and exhibited the lowest variability among the cell specimens.

Flow cytometric MRD detection by the establishment of a leukemia-associated phenotype (LAP) at diagnosis can be used in 80% of AML patients, allowing detection and functional characterization of MRD in follow-up bone marrow. One of the mechanisms contributing to inefficient chemotherapy is apoptosis resistance. Measuring apoptosis parameters in MRD cells will help to unravel the importance of apoptosis resistance in AML. We therefore developed a four-color flow cytometry method that enables establishment of apoptosis-related protein expression such as Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), Mcl-1 and Bax at diagnosis and in MRD. Firstly, validation of this assay using Western blot analysis in five leukemia cell lines showed a significant correlation (R=0.70: P<0.0001). Secondly, the influence of the permeabilization procedure on LAP expression was investigated in 38 AML samples at diagnosis and in 42 MRD samples. Quantification of the frequency of LAP+ cells with and without permeabilization showed no significant differences (diagnosis: P= 0.57, follow-up: P= 0.43). The flow cytometric protocol thus enables analysis of apoptosis-related proteins at different stages of the disease, which will lead to a better understanding of the role of apoptosis resistance in the emergence of MRD in AML.","['van Stijn, A', 'Kok, A', 'van der Pol, M A', 'Feller, N', 'Roemen, G M J M', 'Westra, A H', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['van Stijn A', 'Kok A', 'van der Pol MA', 'Feller N', 'Roemen GM', 'Westra AH', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Haematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Saponins/pharmacology', 'Specimen Handling', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402885 [doi]', '2402885 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):780-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402885.,,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Saponins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, they are at high risk of progression to symptomatic myeloma, with a median time to progression of approximately 1-2 years. We report the final results of a phase II trial of thalidomide as initial therapy for early-stage multiple myeloma in an attempt to delay progression to symptomatic disease. In total, 31 patients with smoldering or indolent multiple myeloma were studied at the Mayo Clinic. Two patients were deemed ineligible because they were found to have received prior therapy for myeloma, and were excluded from analyses except for toxicity. Thalidomide was initiated at a starting dose of 200 mg/day. Patients were followed-up monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Of the 29 eligible patients, 10 (34%) had a partial response to therapy with at least 50% or greater reduction in serum and urine monoclonal (M) protein. When minor responses (25-49% decrease in M protein) were included, the response rate was 66%. Three patients had progressive disease while on therapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of progression-free survival are 80% at 1 year and 63% at 2 years. Major grade 3-4 toxicities included two patients with somnolence and one patient each with neuropathy, deep-vein thrombosis, hearing loss, weakness, sinus bradycardia, and edema. Thalidomide has significant activity in early-stage myeloma and has the potential to delay progression to symptomatic disease.

An interesting candidate signal is hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF), since its receptor Met is expressed on MM cells, while HGF is produced by BM stromal cells and by some MM cell lines, enabling para- or autocrine interaction. To explore this hypothesis, we studied the biological effects of HGF stimulation on MM cell lines and on primary MMs. We observed that Met is expressed by the majority of MM cell lines and by approximately half of the primary plasma cell neoplasms tested. Stimulation of MM cells with HGF led to the activation of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/PKB) pathways, signaling routes that have been implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival. Indeed, functional studies demonstrated that HGF has strong proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects on both MM cell lines and primary MM cells. Furthermore, by applying specific signal-transduction inhibitors, we demonstrated that MEK is required for HGF-induced proliferation, whereas activation of PI3K is required for both HGF-induced proliferation and for rescue of MM cells from apoptosis. Taken together, our data indicate that HGF is a potent myeloma growth and survival factor and suggest that the HGF/Met pathway is a potential therapeutic target in MM.","['Derksen, P W B', 'de Gorter, D J J', 'Meijer, H P', 'Bende, R J', 'van Dijk, M', 'Lokhorst, H M', 'Bloem, A C', 'Spaargaren, M', 'Pals, S T']","['Derksen PW', 'de Gorter DJ', 'Meijer HP', 'Bende RJ', 'van Dijk M', 'Lokhorst HM', 'Bloem AC', 'Spaargaren M', 'Pals ST']","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Aged', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Female', 'Hepatocyte Growth Factor/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology', 'ras Proteins/physiology']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402875 [doi]', '2402875 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):764-74. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402875.,,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '67256-21-7 (Hepatocyte Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Application of the new FISH assays to a series of 24 angioimmunoblastic and 12 cutaneous T-cell lymphomas confirmed the cytogenetic evidence of lack of breakpoints in the TCRA/D or TCRB locus. Simultaneous detection of TCRA/D or TCRB breaks was achieved in a multicolor approach, which was further combined with detection of the T-cell-specific CD3 antigen in a multicolor FICTION (Fluorescence Immunophenotyping and Interphase Cytogenetics as a Tool for the Investigation of Neoplasm) assay. These new FISH and FICTION assays provide sensitive, rapid and accurate tools for the diagnosis and biological characterization of T-cell malignancies.","['Gesk, S', 'Martin-Subero, J I', 'Harder, L', 'Luhmann, B', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Grote, W', 'Siebert, R']","['Gesk S', 'Martin-Subero JI', 'Harder L', 'Luhmann B', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Grote W', 'Siebert R']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosome Painting/methods', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7/*genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta/*genetics', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sezary Syndrome/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402884 [doi]', '2402884 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):738-45. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402884.,,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, this type of AML often shows eosinophilia and has a high complete remission rate with conventional chemotherapy. t(8;21) AML is also frequently associated with additional karyotypic aberrations, such as a loss of the sex chromosome; however, it is unclear whether these aberrations change the biological and clinical characteristics of t(8;21) AML. To investigate this issue, 94 patients with t(8;21) AML were categorized according to their additional karyotypic aberrations, which were detected in more than three cases, and then morphologic features, phenotypes, expression of cytokine receptors, and clinical features were compared to t(8;21) AML without other additional aberrant karyotypes. t(8;21) AML with loss of the sex chromosome and abnormality of chromosome 9 were found in 27 cases (29.3%) and 10 cases (10.6%), respectively; however, no differences were observed from the t(8;21) AML without other additional karyotypes in terms of morphological and phenotypic features. There was also no significant difference in the clinical outcome among these three groups. On the other hand, trisomy 4 was found in three cases (3.2%) and these cells showed low expressions of CD19 (P=0.06) and IL-7 receptor (P=0.05), and high expressions of CD33 (P=0.13), CD18 (P=0.03), and CD56 (P=0.03) when compared to t(8;21) AML without additional karyotypes. Moreover, all three t(8;21) AML cases with trisomy 4 did not show eosinophilia in their bone marrow and died within 2.4 years. These observations suggest that additional karyotypic aberration, t(8;21) with trisomy 4 is rare, but it may constitute a distinctive subtype of t(8;21) AML.","['Nishii, K', 'Usui, E', 'Katayama, N', 'Lorenzo, F 5th', 'Nakase, K', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Miwa, H', 'Mizutani, M', 'Tanaka, I', 'Nasu, K', 'Dohy, H', 'Kyo, T', 'Taniwaki, M', 'Ueda, T', 'Kita, K', 'Shiku, H']","['Nishii K', 'Usui E', 'Katayama N', 'Lorenzo F 5th', 'Nakase K', 'Kobayashi T', 'Miwa H', 'Mizutani M', 'Tanaka I', 'Nasu K', 'Dohy H', 'Kyo T', 'Taniwaki M', 'Ueda T', 'Kita K', 'Shiku H']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Tsu, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/*ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Japan', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Receptors, Interleukin-7/analysis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', '*Translocation, Genetic', '*Trisomy']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402871 [doi]', '2402871 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):731-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402871.,,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-7)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2003 Sep;17(9):1915; author reply 1915-6.

Lymphocytes, monocytes and leukaemic blasts with their corresponding intracellular cytokine profiles were evaluated by four-colour flow cytometry. In 50 microl samples of whole blood, surface labelling for CD45, CD8 and CD3 was used for cell identification prior to intracellular staining for interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, IL-12 and interferon (IFN)-gamma. Absolute numbers of CD8(+) and CD8(-) (putative CD4(+)) T-cells, NK cells (CD8(+)/CD3(-)) and monocytes were determined by reference to a fixed number of added fluorescent beads. The absolute numbers of CD8(-) and CD8(+) T-cells in the blood of patients with AML were similar to those of normal controls. More of the lymphocytes in the blood of leukaemic patients spontaneously produced cytokines compared with those of controls. Furthermore, primary AML blasts secreted predominantly IFN-gamma. After recovery from chemotherapy, lymphocyte counts tended to be lower than in normals and reduction of NK cells reached significance after the second chemotherapy (P=0.01). A prominent CD8(lo)/CD3(lo-int) lymphocyte subset appeared after recovery in some patients. This laboratory application of the study of cell subsets and intracellular cytokines in patients undergoing treatment may be helpful in monitoring immunological responses in AML.","['Panoskaltsis, N', 'Reid, C D L', 'Knight, S C']","['Panoskaltsis N', 'Reid CD', 'Knight SC']","['Antigen Presentation Research Geroup, Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College London and Department of Haematology, Northwick Park Hospital, Harrow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/economics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/economics/*methods', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood', 'Interleukin-10/*blood', 'Interleukin-12/*blood', 'Interleukin-4/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', '*Neoplastic Cells, Circulating', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Subtraction Technique']",,2003/04/15 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/15 05:00'],"['2003/04/15 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/15 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402835 [doi]', '2402835 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):716-30. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402835.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological and clinical significance of HLA Class II antigen expression by AML cells is not known. Therefore, we sought to characterize cases of AML without detectable HLA-DR expression. Samples from 248 consecutive adult AML patients were immunophenotyped by multiparameter flow cytometry at diagnosis. HLA-DR antigens were not detected on AML cells from 43 patients, including 20 with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), and 23 with other subtypes of AML. All APL cases had t(15;17), but there were no characteristic chromosome abnormalities in non-APL cases. No direct expression of other antigens was identified in HLA-DR-negative APL and non-APL cases. Interestingly, cells from three HLA-DR-negative non-APL patients had similar morphology to that of the hypogranular variant of APL. This morphology, however, was not present in any HLA-DR-positive AML cases. Treatment response was similar in the 23 HLA-DR-negative non-APL and the 205 HLA-DR-positive patients. Finally, relapse was infrequently associated with changes in HLA-DR antigen expression, as the HLA-DR antigen was lost at relapse in only 4% of HLA-DR-positive cases, and was gained at relapse in only 17% of HLA-DR-negative cases. We conclude that HLA-DR-negative AML includes approximately equal numbers of APL and non-APL cases, and that the morphology of HLA-DR-negative non-APL cases can mimic the hypogranular variant of APL. The diagnosis of APL cannot be based on morphology and lack of HLA-DR antigen expression; rather, it requires cytogenetic or molecular confirmation.","['Wetzler, M', 'McElwain, B K', 'Stewart, C C', 'Blumenson, L', 'Mortazavi, A', 'Ford, L A', 'Slack, J L', 'Barcos, M', 'Ferrone, S', 'Baer, M R']","['Wetzler M', 'McElwain BK', 'Stewart CC', 'Blumenson L', 'Mortazavi A', 'Ford LA', 'Slack JL', 'Barcos M', 'Ferrone S', 'Baer MR']","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/pathology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402865 [doi]', '2402865 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):707-15. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402865.,"['CA 16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 67108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The substantial sample size allowed separate analyses according to age younger or older than 12 months for the various cytogenetic subsets. Infants with t(4;11) ALL had an especially dismal prognosis when their disease was characterized by a poor early response to prednisone (P=0.0005 for overall comparison; 5-year event-free survival (EFS), 0 vs 23+/-+/-12% s.e. for those with good response), or age less than 3 months (P=0.0003, 5-year EFS, 5+/-+/-5% vs 23.4+/-+/-4% for those over 3 months). A poor prednisone response also appeared to confer a worse outcome for older children with t(4;11) ALL. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation failed to improve outcome in either age group. Among patients with t(11;19) ALL, those with a T-lineage immunophenotype, who were all over 1 year of age, had a better outcome than patients over 1 year of age with B-lineage ALL (overall comparison, P=0.065; 5-year EFS, 88+/-+/-13 vs 46+/-14%). In the heterogeneous subgroup with del(11)(q23), National Cancer Institute-Rome risk criteria based on age and leukocyte count had prognostic significance (P=0.04 for overall comparison; 5-year EFS, 64+/-+/-8% (high risk) vs 83+/-+/-6% (standard risk)). This study illustrates the marked clinical heterogeneity among and within subgroups of infants or older children with ALL and specific 11q23 abnormalities, and identifies patients at particularly high risk of failure who may benefit from innovative therapy.","['Pui, C-H', 'Chessells, J M', 'Camitta, B', 'Baruchel, A', 'Biondi, A', 'Boyett, J M', 'Carroll, A', 'Eden, O B', 'Evans, W E', 'Gadner, H', 'Harbott, J', 'Harms, D O', 'Harrison, C J', 'Harrison, P L', 'Heerema, N', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Kamps, W', 'Masera, G', 'Pullen, J', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Richards, S', 'Riehm, H', 'Sallan, S', 'Sather, H', 'Shuster, J', 'Silverman, L B', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Vilmer, E', 'Zhou, Y', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Schrappe, M']","['Pui CH', 'Chessells JM', 'Camitta B', 'Baruchel A', 'Biondi A', 'Boyett JM', 'Carroll A', 'Eden OB', 'Evans WE', 'Gadner H', 'Harbott J', 'Harms DO', 'Harrison CJ', 'Harrison PL', 'Heerema N', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Kamps W', 'Masera G', 'Pullen J', 'Raimondi SC', 'Richards S', 'Riehm H', 'Sallan S', 'Sather H', 'Shuster J', 'Silverman LB', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Vilmer E', 'Zhou Y', 'Gaynon PS', 'Schrappe M']","[""St. Jude Chidren's Research Hospital and University of Tennessee, Memphis, 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/ultrastructure', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States/epidemiology']",41,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402883 [doi]', '2402883 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Apr;17(4):700-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402883.,"['CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78824/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect was dose dependent, dependent on E:T ratio and the time between tumor inoculation and administration of bscCD19xCD3. No therapeutic effect was seen in the presence of human lymphocytes alone, a vehicle control, or with a bispecific single-chain construct of identical T cell-binding activity but different target specificity. In a leukemic nonobese diabetic SCID mouse model, treatment with bscCD19xCD3 prolonged survival of mice in a dose-dependent fashion.

Moreover, glutamate levels increase in the CNS in many pathological conditions in which T cells exert either beneficial or detrimental effects. We discovered that normal human T cells, human T leukemia cells, and mouse anti-myelin basic protein T cells express high levels of glutamate ion channel receptor (ionotropic) of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) subtype 3 (GluR3). The evidence for GluR3 on T cells includes GluR3-specific RT-PCR, Western blot, immunocytochemical staining and flow cytometry. Sequencing showed that the T cell-expressed GluR3 is identical with the brain GluR3. Glutamate (10 nM), in the absence of any additional molecule, triggered T cell function: integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to laminin and fibronectin, a function normally performed by activated T cells only. The effect of glutamate was mimicked by AMPA receptor-agonists and blocked specifically by the selective receptor-antagonists 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX) and 6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxalin-2,3-dione (NBQX), and by relevant anti-integrin mAbs. Glutamate also increased the CXCR4-mediated T cell chemotactic migration toward the key chemokine CXCL12/stromal cell-derived factor-1. GluR3 expression on normal, cancer and autoimmune-associated T cells and the ability of glutamate to directly activate T cell function could be of substantial scientific and clinical importance to normal neuroimmune dialogues and to CNS diseases and injury, and especially to: 1) T cell transmigration to the CNS and patrolling in the brain, 2) T cell-mediated multiple sclerosis, and 3) autoimmune epilepsy, as neurotoxic anti-GluR3 Abs are found and suspected to cause/potentiate seizures and neuropathology in several types of human epilepsies. Thus far, GluR3 was found only on neurons and glia cells; our results reveal a novel peripheral source of this antigenic receptor.","['Ganor, Yonatan', 'Besser, Michal', 'Ben-Zakay, Naomie', 'Unger, Tamar', 'Levite, Mia']","['Ganor Y', 'Besser M', 'Ben-Zakay N', 'Unger T', 'Levite M']","['Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.

Results of the PETHEMA-LAL3/97 study.,445-53,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Short, intensive multiagent chemotherapy has resulted in significant progress in Burkitt's lymphoma and leukemia. A protocol was designed to treat all adult patients with mature B-cell lymphoma or leukemia with the aims of comparing the response to therapy and survival with regards to their HIV infection status. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-three adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt's leukemia were treated. Response to therapy, survival and toxicity were evaluated according to their HIV infection status. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 53 years (range 15-74). There were no differences in CR rates between HIV-negative (77%) and HIV-positive patients (71%). Only age > 60 years was associated with a lower CR rate (OR 0.18, 95%CI 0.04-0.81, p=0.026). The 2-year overall survival (OS) probability was 51% (95%CI, 38%-64%) for the 53 patients. The OS of HIV-negative and HIV-positive patients did not significantly differ. Only age > 60 years was associated with a shorter OS (OR 5.1, 95%CI 2.0-12.7, p=0.001). The 2-year disease free survival (DFS) for the 40 patients achieving CR was 60% (95%CI, 45%-75%). Age > 60 years was the only identified factor associated with a shorter DFS (OR 5.2, 95%CI 1.4-20, p=0.015). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the effectiveness of intensive strategies in adult patients with advanced stage Burkitt's lymphoma or leukemia. It also shows the feasibility of these strategies in individuals with HIV infection with comparable results.

Moreover, monosomy of chromosome 7 and 7q deletions have been associated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Using a panel of 11 polymorphic microsatellite markers at bands 7q21-q36, we investigated fifty patients (acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n=33 and acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL], n=17) for LOH, a hallmark of possible involvement of tumor suppressor genes. In parallel, the same acute leukemia (AL) cases were studied by conventional cytogenetics. RESULTS: A total of 48 spots of allelic loss were observed in 16 (32%) out of 50 patients (AML, n=11 and ALL, n=5). Among LOH+ve cases 3 showed chromosome 7 monosomies, whereas no cytogenetically detectable abnormalities were observed in chromosome 7 in the remaining 13. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Comparison with karyotypic results indicated that presence of LOH at 7q21-q36 was significantly associated with other chromosomal aberrations. In fact, an altered karyotype was detectable in 87% of LOH+ve and in 52% of LOH(-ve) AL cases (p=0.024). In addition, LOH at 7q was prevalently associated with unfavorable cytogenetic lesions (p=0.013). Our study represents the first report of a significant association between LOH and recurrent chromosomal abnormalities in AL patients suggesting that the 7q21-q36, region may be an unstable area prone to chromosome breakage in patients with an abnormal karyotype.","['Basirico, Rosaria', 'Pirrotta, Rosa', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Mirto, Salvo', 'Cascio, Lucia', 'Pagano, Maria', 'Cammarata, Giuseppe', 'Magrin, Silvana', 'Santoro, Alessandra']","['Basirico R', 'Pirrotta R', 'Fabbiano F', 'Mirto S', 'Cascio L', 'Pagano M', 'Cammarata G', 'Magrin S', 'Santoro A']","['Division of Hematology and BMT Unit, Ospedale ""V.

Flt3 is activated by binding of its natural Flt3-ligand (Flt3-L), but Flt3 genes with internal tandem duplications (Flt3-ITD) or Asp(D)-835 point mutations encode molecules with constitutive activation. The aim of this study was to compare functional effects of exogenous Flt3-L on AML blast populations with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities. DESIGN AND METHODS: Native AML blasts were derived from 64 consecutive patients with high blast counts in peripheral blood, and in vitro models were used to characterize the Flt3-L effects. RESULTS: The Flt3 protein levels showed a similar wide variation between AML blast populations with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities. Flt3-L was an autocrine growth factor only for 2 patients. Flt3-ITD+ AML cells had lower responsiveness to exogenous cytokines than cell populations without Flt3 abnormalities, but exogenous Flt3-L increased blast proliferation both for patients without Flt3 abnormalities and patients with Flt3-ITD as well as D835 mutations. This enhancement was observed even in the presence of other exogenous cytokines and included clonogenic AML progenitors. Flt3-L inhibited proliferation only for 1 patient, but had divergent effects on AML blast cytokine release. Flt3-L affected AML blast differentiation (inhibition of erythroid colonies, increased neutrophil granulation) only in a minority of patients, whereas it had an anti-apoptotic effect for a larger subset of patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Intracellular signaling initiated by Flt3 ligation modulates the functional phenotype for native human AML blasts both with and without genetic Flt3 abnormalities.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Hovland, Randi', 'Wergeland, Line', 'Huang, Tien-Sheng', 'Gjertsen, Bjorn Tore']","['Bruserud O', 'Hovland R', 'Wergeland L', 'Huang TS', 'Gjertsen BT']","['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Apr;88(4):416-28.,,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These fusion proteins possess a constitutive PDGFRbeta tyrosine kinase activity, leading to aberrant PDGFRbeta signaling and cellular transformation. The expression of PDGFRbeta fusions in CMML could have therapeutic relevance, as PDGFRb is inhibited by the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. Here, we investigated the possibility of employing imatinib to treat CMML. DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed the effect of imatinib on TEL/PDGFRbeta transformed cells in terms of proliferation, by trypan blue exclusion and 3H-thymidine uptake, and TEL/PDGFRbeta autophosphorylation by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. TEL/PDGFRbeta expression in mononuclear cells from the peripheral blood of 27 clinically diagnosed CMML patients was determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Imatinib potently inhibited the proliferation of TEL/PDGFRbeta transformed cells (IC50=7.5 nM), and TEL/PDGFRbeta kinase activity. However, TEL/PDGFRbeta expression was detected in only 1 of 27 CMML patients (4%, confidence intervals: 0-13%). Additionally, another PDGFRbeta fusion protein, Hip1/PDGFRbeta, had a similarly low incidence in the same samples: 1 of 25 (4%, confidence intervals: 0-14%). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although imatinib represents an attractive therapeutic agent for neoplasias associated with abnormal PDGFRbeta signaling, the low frequency of the TEL/PDGFRbeta and Hip1/PDGFRbeta fusion proteins in CMML suggests that its application to this disease maybe limited. Detection of PDGFRbeta fusion genes in individual patients is necessary in order to employ this drug rationally in CMML.","['Gunby, Rosalind Helen', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Tassi, Elena', 'Le Coutre, Philipp', 'Pogliani, Enrico', 'Specchia, Giorgina', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo']","['Gunby RH', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Tassi E', 'Le Coutre P', 'Pogliani E', 'Specchia G', 'Biondi A', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C']","['Oncogenic Fusion Protein Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale Tumori, 20133 Milan, Italy. rosalind.gunby@istitutotumori.mi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*blood/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2004/09/24 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/09/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Apr;88(4):408-15.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (TEL-PDGFRbeta fusion protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As little is known about the expression of serologically identified CTA in leukemias so far, we investigated the expression of 5 CT genes (SSX-1, HOM-MEL-40/SSX-2, HOM-TES-14/SCP-1, SCP-3 and NY-ESO-1) in leukemic blood samples obtained from patients with either acute lymphatic leukemias (ALL) or myelocytic leukemia (AML). RT-PCR-analyses showed no expression of any of the CT-genes in the leukemia samples of 19 patients with AML, whereas frequent expression was found in ALL. In the 17 ALL cases studied, SCP3a, SSX-1, HOM-MEL-40/SXX-2 and HOM-TES-14/SCP-1 were expressed in 47, 29, 29 and 12%, respectively, whereas no case was positive for NY-ESO-1. 65% of patients with ALL showed expression of at least one, 41% of two or more of the five CT-genes investigated. We conclude that a majority of the ALLs might be amenable for specific immunotherapeutic interventions.

The rationale was that DEX would permit higher doses of cardiotoxic drugs to be given. The drug itself may have therapeutic potential as well. Finally, there are concerns that the drug may, as a protective agent, diminish the effectiveness of various chemotherapeutics. To help resolve the question about potential drug antagonism, we undertook a series of in vitro analyses of DEX and various combinations with anthracyclines and other agents. Colony-forming assays were used to evaluate stem-cell renewal of myeloid cells in vitro, and median-effect analysis was used to evaluate antagonism, synergism, and additivity. The anthracyclines doxorubicin, daunorubicin, and idarubicin were individually combined with DEX to study in vitro effects in leukemic myeloid cell lines. In the hope, we could extend the findings to non-anthracyclines, etoposide and cytosine arabinoside were also evaluated in combination with DEX using the same in vitro model and method. We found that the effects of DEX in combination with any of the anthracyclines were schedule dependent. The antitumor effect was greater for each combination than for any anthracycline alone except when DEX was administered 24h before doxorubicin or daunorubicin. These data were corroborated through median-effect analysis. Etoposide in combination with DEX was synergistic for all combinations and schedules, and the combination of cytosine arabinoside and DEX was effective depending on the schedule used. DEX appears to be a promising drug in the treatment of AML and warrants further clinical study involving novel drug combinations.","['Pearlman, Michael', 'Jendiroba, David', 'Pagliaro, Lance', 'Keyhani, Afsaneh', 'Liu, Baoshun', 'Freireich, Emil J']","['Pearlman M', 'Jendiroba D', 'Pagliaro L', 'Keyhani A', 'Liu B', 'Freireich EJ']","['Departments of Leukemia and Special Medical Education Programs, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Unit 55, The University of Texas, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage', 'Stem Cells/drug effects']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002734 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00273-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Jul;27(7):617-26. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00273-4.,,"['5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We observed that Ran was expressed in a biphasic mode. Following a decrease in mRNA level during the initial hours of induction, Ran re-expressed at 24-48 h, and gradually declined again. To investigate the role of Ran during MEL differentiation we constructed MEL transfectants capable to express or block Ran mRNA production constitutively.

Currently, Gleevec is also being used in protocols for treatment of other malignancies such as melanoma. A few, non-descript cutaneous eruptions have been reported in patients receiving Gleevec. CASE REPORT: A patient with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor developed a centripetal, slightly pruritic, predominantly macular eruption. Histologically, there was a superficial and mid-perivascular cellular infiltrate of hyperchromatic, large lymphocytes with focal epidermotropism, thus resembling mycosis fungoides. The infiltrate was composed predominantly of T cells (CD3), with a 1:1 CD4:CD8 ratio, therefore consistent with a reactive process, i.e. a drug reaction induced by Gleevec. CONCLUSION: Gleevec should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pseudolymphoma drug eruptions.","['Clark, Sandra H', 'Duvic, Madeleine', 'Prieto, Victor G']","['Clark SH', 'Duvic M', 'Prieto VG']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas--MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Benzamides', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/etiology/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/*adverse effects', 'Skin/*pathology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['053 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0303-6987.2003.053.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2003 Apr;30(4):279-81. doi: 10.1046/j.0303-6987.2003.053.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,['J Cutan Pathol. 2004 Jan;31(1):81.

However, no clear association with multiple myeloma (MM) has been reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pathology reports of the 2357 patients with multiple myeloma at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences were reviewed to retrieve cases who had developed SS. Cytogenetic studies and immunoglobulin secretory status were retrieved. Five cases of SS in MM and 25 cases of SS in patients without MM underwent syndecan-1 immunohistochemistry. OBSERVATIONS: Six cases of SS occurring in the setting of MM showed a predominance in patients secreting IgG paraprotein. Five of the six patients received granulocyte-colony stimulating factor while the sixth received granulocyte-monocyte-colony stimulating factor. Fifty percent showed a non-specific cytogenetic anomaly. CONCLUSIONS: There is no specific cytogenetic anomaly associated with SS in the setting of MM. This paraneoplastic syndrome may be secondary to elevated levels of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), possibly with a component of enhanced sensitivity to endogenous G-CSF. The immunoglobulin secretory status parallels that seen in MM with cutaneous involvement, but IgG secretors may be at an increased risk of developing SS compared with their counterparts who secrete other immunoglobulins.","['Bayer-Garner, I B', 'Cottler-Fox, M', 'Smoller, B R']","['Bayer-Garner IB', 'Cottler-Fox M', 'Smoller BR']","['Department of Pathology, Baylor Medical College, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cutan Pathol,Journal of cutaneous pathology,0425124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/blood/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood/metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Paraproteins/analysis', 'Proteoglycans/analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sweet Syndrome/blood/*complications/pathology', 'Syndecan-1', 'Syndecans']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']","['029 [pii]', '10.1046/j.0303-6987.2002.029.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Cutan Pathol. 2003 Apr;30(4):261-4. doi: 10.1046/j.0303-6987.2002.029.x.,,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Paraproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (SDC1 protein, human)', '0 (Syndecan-1)', '0 (Syndecans)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this series, the lead compounds elinafide and bisnafide have reached clinical trials, and the search for more potent analogues remains a priority. In the course of a medicinal chemistry program aimed at discovering novel antitumor drugs based on the naphthalimide skeleton, different dimeric molecules containing two tetracyclic neutral DNA intercalating chromophores were synthesized. The naphthalimide unit has been fused to a benzene ring (azonafide derivatives), an imidazole, a pyrazine, or, as reported here, a furan ring which increases the planar surface of the chromophore and enhances its stacking properties. We report a detailed investigation of the DNA binding capacity of the dimeric molecule MCI3335 composed of two furonaphthalimide units connected by a 12 A long amino alkyl linker [(CH(2))(2)-NH-(CH(2))(3)-NH-(CH(2))(2)] identical to that of elinafide. Qualitative and quantitative binding studies, in particular using surface plasmon resonance, establish that the dimer binds considerably more tightly to DNA (up to 1000 times) than the corresponding monomer and exhibits a higher sequence selectivity for GC-rich sequences. DNase I footprinting experiments attest that the dimer, and to a lesser extent the monomer, preferentially intercalate at GC sites. The strong binding interaction between the drugs and DNA perturbs the relaxation of supercoiled DNA by topoisomerases, but the test compounds do not promote DNA cleavage by topoisomerase I or II. Despite the lack of poisoning effect toward topoisomerase II, MCI3335 displays a very high cytotoxicity toward CEM human leukemia cells, with an IC(50) in the low nanomolar range, approximately 4 times inferior to that of the reference drug elinafide. Confocal microscopy observations indicate that the monomer shows a stronger tendency to accumulate in the cell nuclei than the dimer. The extremely high cytotoxic potential of MCI3335 is attributed to its enhanced capacity to bind to DNA and to inhibit DNA synthesis, as evidenced by flow cytometry experiments using the BrdU assay. The results provide novel mechanistic information that furthers the understanding of the structure-activity relationships in the bisnaphthalimide series and identify MCI3335 as a novel lead compound for further preclinical investigations.","['Bailly, Christian', 'Carrasco, Carolina', 'Joubert, Alexandra', 'Bal, Christine', 'Wattez, Nicole', 'Hildebrand, Marie-Paule', 'Lansiaux, Amelie', 'Colson, Pierre', 'Houssier, Claude', 'Cacho, Monica', 'Ramos, Ana', 'Brana, Miguel F']","['Bailly C', 'Carrasco C', 'Joubert A', 'Bal C', 'Wattez N', 'Hildebrand MP', 'Lansiaux A', 'Colson P', 'Houssier C', 'Cacho M', 'Ramos A', 'Brana MF']","['INSERM U-524 et Laboratoire de Pharmacologie Antitumorale du Centre Oscar Lambret, IRCL, Place de Verdun, 59045 Lille, France. bailly@ lille.inserm.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Imides/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', '*Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",,2003/04/19 05:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/04/19 05:00'],"['2003/04/19 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi027415c [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2003 Apr 15;42(14):4136-50. doi: 10.1021/bi027415c.,,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Initial experimentation indicating that aspirin and MSM also induced the differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells led to a search for common mechanisms involving these two agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Since the major mechanism of action attributed to aspirin is the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), prostaglandin (PG) production was examined under differentiation-inducing conditions in MEL cells. RESULTS: Aspirin at low, nontoxic concentrations induced differentiation leading to terminal cell division. Aspirin had no effect on PGE2 production and minimal inhibitory effect on COX activity. Furthermore, salicylate, a major metabolite of aspirin and an ineffective COX inhibitor, induced differentiation at concentrations comparable to aspirin. Similar experiments with MSM indicated that MSM had no effect on PGE2 production or on COX activity under differentiation--inducing conditions and at concentrations reported in other studies. CONCLUSION: These experiments indicated that aspirin and MSM induced differentiation by a COX-independent mechanism(s) and suggested that a common mechanism for the chemopreventive action invoked by both agents might be the activation of gene functions leading to differentiation and thereby dismantling the cellular capacity for proliferation.","['Ebisuzaki, Kaney']",['Ebisuzaki K'],"['Departments of Microbiology and Immunology and of Biochemistry, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, N6A-5C1, Canada. kebisuza@julian.uwo.ca']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Sulfones/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 Jan-Feb;23(1A):453-8.,,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)', '0 (Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfones)', '9H4PO4Z4FT (dimethyl sulfone)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mutations in BRCA1 account for up to 40-50% of families with hereditary breast cancer only. Mutations in BRCA2 are linked to the other half of inherited breast cancer families and also to male breast cancer. On the contrary, no sporadic breast tumors have been shown to harbor mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. It seems that altered expressions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may contribute to breast cancer development. Moreover, BRCA1 and BRCA2 expressions are regulated in human breast cancer cell lines by estrogen. We addressed the issue of BRCA1 and BRCA2 expression in male breast cancers and gynecomastias. We investigated the presence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in male breast specimens by immunohistochemical analysis with a panel of antibodies elicited against BRCA1 and BRCA2. The specificity of each antibody has been verified by Western blotting in cell lines from different origins. The characterization of 6 anti-BRCA1 antibodies revealed a BRCA1 200-kDa protein detected in breast cell lines (MDA-MB 231, HBL 100, T-47D and MCF7) or in an acute leukemia (MOLT 4), known to overexpress BRCA1. All 5 anti-BRCA2 antibodies detected a BRCA2 384-kDa protein in the HBL100 and MCF7 breast cell lines. By immunohistochemistry, we found nuclear, perinuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi vesicle, secretion and apical cytoplasmic stainings in gynecomastias and sporadic and hereditary male breast cancers, for BRCA1 and BRCA2 protein expressions. We report an extensive expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in different compartments of the mammary gland cells in male breast carcinomas and gynecomastias.

All 6 patients in chronic phase CML were uniformly negative for the survivin transcript, in contrast to 4 Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) CML patients in blastic crisis, all of whom (100%) were positive for survivin with tangible levels of expression. However, survivin expression was markedly down-regulated in 2 atypical CML patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative (Ph-) blastic crisis. Our data indicates that up-regulation of survivin expression may be involved in typical CML evolution from the chronic into the blastic phase of the disease.","['Badran, Adel', 'Yoshida, Akira', 'Wano, Yuji', 'Imamura, Shin', 'Kawai, Yasukazu', 'Tsutani, Hiroshi', 'Inuzuka, Manabu', 'Ueda, Takanori']","['Badran A', 'Yoshida A', 'Wano Y', 'Imamura S', 'Kawai Y', 'Tsutani H', 'Inuzuka M', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Fukui, 910-1193, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survivin']",,2003/04/12 05:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2003/04/12 05:00'],"['2003/04/12 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2003 Jan-Feb;23(1B):589-92.,,"['0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Survivin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal was to provide preliminary information about patients with undiagnosed CMT who develop ALL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five children with ALL who were enrolled in POG B-precursor or T-cell ALL protocols from 1994 to 1999 subsequently were determined to have CMT hereditary neuropathy. Their clinical presentations and treatment records were reviewed in detail. Records of all patients entered on POG 9201 (lesser-risk ALL) were reviewed to identify all cases of significant vincristine toxicity noted in the first 6 months of treatment. RESULTS: The five identified patients all had substantial peripheral neurotoxicity that required alteration in treatment and/or orthopedic/physical therapy evaluation and follow-up. The POG 9201 review identified 25 of 686 patients (3.6%) with significant peripheral neuropathy. Three of 25 were diagnosed with CMT; the others have had no testing reported. CONCLUSIONS: A family history of CMT or other peripheral neuropathy should be sought at the time of diagnosis of ALL. Testing for CMT should be considered in any child with substantial vincristine-induced peripheral neurotoxicity. Treatment of such patients must be individualized.

Case series of IA in the pediatric oncology population are limited but generally report poor overall survival. METHODS: Medical records were reviewed of all patients receiving conventional chemotherapy for malignant disease who developed IA at Children's Hospital and Regional Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2002. RESULTS: During the study period there were 11 cases of IA in pediatric cancer patients treated with conventional chemotherapy. All patients had pulmonary IA; two also had evidence of disseminated disease. All patients underwent diagnostic tissue biopsy. Sixty-four percent required further surgery to excise bulky disease. Medical therapy varied with disease presentation and the overall clinical picture, although prolonged treatment with amphotericin B and itraconazole was the mainstay of therapy. Resolution of clinical disease was seen in 91% of patients. Seventy-three percent received further chemotherapy. The 3-year estimated survival was 82%, with a median follow-up of 32.5 months. CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and aggressive intervention improve long-term survival from IA in immunocompromised pediatric oncology patients. Aggressive surgical resection, prolonged medical therapy after gross resolution of disease, and chemoprophylaxis during subsequent chemotherapy decrease the likelihood of recurrent IA despite subsequent cytotoxic therapy. The ability to proceed with intensive chemotherapy despite a history of IA may improve long-term survival.","['Wright, Jessica A', 'Bradfield, Scott M', 'Park, Julie R', 'Hawkins, Douglas S']","['Wright JA', 'Bradfield SM', 'Park JR', 'Hawkins DS']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington 98105-0371, USA. jawright@u.washington.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Anti-Infective Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', 'Aspergillosis/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality/surgery', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/complications/drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality/surgery', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/drug therapy', 'Neutropenia/complications', 'Opportunistic Infections/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*mortality/surgery', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survivors']",36,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-200304000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2003 Apr;25(4):286-91. doi: 10.1097/00043426-200304000-00004.,,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antifungal Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deviations affected chromosomes 1 (n = 21), 2 (n = 11), 4 (n = 11), 5 (n = 9), 6 (n = 7), 7 (n = 2), 8 (n = 2), 12 (n = 5), 13 (n = 15), 14 (n = 1), 16 (n = 17), 17 (n = 11), 19 (n = 21), 20 (n = 12), and/or 22 (n = 17). None of the imbalances were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Using digoxigenin and biotin-conjugated nucleotides in exemplary cases (n = 5) led to the disappearance of the signal deviations. Repeated CGH experiments using seven different reference DNAs showed remarkable variations in the signal deviations. CONCLUSION: Hybridization differences depend not only on the hapten or fluorochrome-labeled nucleotides used for DNA labeling, but also on the reference DNA chosen. Therefore, close control of CGH experiments is mandatory, and additional techniques such as FISH should be performed to confirm the results obtained by CGH.","['Wilkens, Ludwig', 'Tchinda, Joelle', 'Burkhardt, Dagmar', 'Kreipe, Hans Heinrich']","['Wilkens L', 'Tchinda J', 'Burkhardt D', 'Kreipe HH']","['Institute of Cell and Molecular Pathology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Pathobiology,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",9007504,IM,"['Adult', '*Artifacts', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'DNA/*analysis', '*DNA Probes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/*methods', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/11/06 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2002/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000069330 [doi]', '69330 [pii]']",ppublish,Pathobiology. 2002-2003;70(4):204-8. doi: 10.1159/000069330.,,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 S.

One in 3 grandparent farms was closed due to ALV-J infection in 1998 in Taiwan. The remaining 2 farms were forced to import breeding chicks from different breeding companies afterwards. We report on the ALV-J infection status among these breeders, their progeny and Taiwan native chickens during 2000-2002. The weekly mortality for the male line among the infected breeders was higher than that for the female line. Sixty-three percent (5/8) of the broiler flocks were infected with ALV-J. The surface (SU) portion of the env gene from the ALV-J field isolates was cloned and sequenced. The phylogenetic results show that all of the isolates fell into 2 clusters. Unexpectedly, the isolates from the same breeds fell into different clusters, with a cluster including isolates from different breeding companies. ALV-Js from native chickens crossbred with imported chickens were placed into the same clusters as those from the imported breeds. The high similarities observed in different ALV-J isolates suggest that different ALV-Js were mixed in the pedigree generations in different breeding lines.","['Thu, Wen-Liang', 'Wang, Ching-Ho']","['Thu WL', 'Wang CH']","['Department of Veterinary Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Vet Med Sci,The Journal of veterinary medical science,9105360,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/epidemiology/virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Breeding', 'Chickens/*virology', 'Female', 'Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical', 'Male', '*Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/epidemiology/virology', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/05/24 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1292/jvms.65.325 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Med Sci. 2003 Mar;65(3):325-8. doi: 10.1292/jvms.65.325.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The RA resistant APL cell lines NB4-R1 and NB4-R2 were used as in vitro models. The effect of As(2)O(3) and/or 8-CPT-cAMP was evaluated according to cellular morphology, cell surface antigen and nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) assay. Meanwhile, immunofluorescence analysis and Western blot assay were used to detect the degradation of PML-RAR alpha fusion protein and the change of several key cell cycle regulatory proteins in these cells before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Low dose of As(2)O(3) (0.25 micromol/L) synergized with 8-CPT-cAMP (200 micromol/L) in inducing differentiation of NB4-R1 and NB4-R2 cells, while neither of these two drugs alone could induce differentiation of these cells. In addition, 8-CPT-cAMP was able to inhibit the cell growth by modulating the expression of some important cell cycle regulators and to facilitate the As(2)O(3)-mediated degradation of PML-RAR alpha fusion protein.

METHODS: Antigen peptide mixtures were prepared from different leukaemia cell lines and then bound with Hsp70 in vitro. The activation and proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were observed after the stimulation by different Hsp70-peptide complexes. The cytotoxicity of such activated PBMCs to different target cells was assayed. RESULTS: The antigen peptides from different leukaemia cell lines were mixed ones, which could activate PBMC effectively with Hsp70 and stimulate the activated PBMC to proliferate. The proliferative PBMC had specific cytotoxicity to the corresponding leukaemia cells. To Hut-78 cell, Molt-4 cell and Jurkat cell, the cytotoxicity of PBMC activated by either Hut78-peptides or Molt-4-peptides was significantly stronger than that of PBMC activated by HL-60-peptides (P < 0.05). The cytotoxicity to Jurkat cell of PBMC activated by Hut78/Molt-4-peptides was significantly stronger than that of PBMC activated by Hut78-peptides or Molt-4-peptides alone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Antigen peptide mixture from T lymphocytic leukaemia cells is able to induce specific antitumor immunity. There is a cross-reactivity among antigen peptide mixtures from different T lymphocytic leukaemia cell lines, with the more crossed antigen peptides obtained from the mixtures of different antigen peptides from different T lymphocytic leukaemia cell lines, which suggests that the antigen peptide mixture with broad antigenic spectrum could possibly be prepared by using multiple leukaemia cell lines.","['Huang, Bo', 'Feng, Zuo-hua', 'Li, Dong', 'Zhang, Gui-mei', 'Wang, Hong-tao']","['Huang B', 'Feng ZH', 'Li D', 'Zhang GM', 'Wang HT']","['Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Tongji Medical College, Wuhan 430030, China.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi,Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology],7910681,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cross Reactions', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*drug effects', 'Peptides/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/immunology']",,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/08/12 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Zhong Liu Za Zhi. 2003 Jan;25(1):9-12.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This shortening serves as a ""mitotic clock"" which limits the number of divisions that a normal somatic cell can undergo. Cells undergoing continuous division need some method of bypassing this clock. One such method is the expression of telomerase. This ribonucleoprotein is an enzyme that rebuilds the lost portion of the telomeres. Between 80-95% of tumors are telomerase-positive, including ovarian carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, neuroblastoma, leukemia/lymphoma, and cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, kidneys and bladder, as well as many immortalized cell lines. While absent in most normal tissues, this enzyme is expressed at higher levels in germline tissues, bone marrow, and lymphocytes. Due to the expression of telomerase in most tumor cells and its absence in most normal tissues, telomerase inhibitors are being investigated as possible anticancer agents. This review focuses on non-reverse transcriptase inhibitor, non-oligonucleotide and non-G-quartet interactive agent telomerase inhibitors. These agents include: differentiating agents, kinases and phosphatases, cell cycle and apoptosis regulating agents, immunotherapeutic agents, antibiotics, steroids, bisindole derivatives, and a variety of other compounds.

Collectively, these studies suggest that Fe-deprivation may be a useful anti-cancer strategy. However, the efficacy of DFO is severely limited due to its poor ability to permeate cell membranes and bind intracellular Fe pools. These limitations have encouraged the development of other Fe chelators that are far more effective than DFO. One group of ligands that have been extensively investigated are those of the pyridoxal isonicotinoyl hydrazone (PIH) class. In this review the marked anti-proliferative effects of the PIH analogs are discussed with reference to their mechanisms of action and structure-activity relationships. In particular, we discuss the activity of a novel group of ligands that are ""hybrid"" chelators derived from our most effective PIH analogs and thiosemicarbazones. The anti-tumor activity of the PIH analogs and other chelators such as tachpyridine, O-trensox and the desferrithiocin analogs have been well characterized in vitro.

Increasing multiple resistance to current drugs used for therapy, non-compliance to therapy or co-morbidity are challenging problems that do not allow use of standard therapy in all patients. Quinolones are claimed to be active drugs in TB infection. Moxifloxacin shows the highest intracellular concentration in vitro and in experimental animals, but long-term tolerability is unknown. Our aim was to observe in compliant patients, not eligible for standard therapy, the effect of 6 months of therapy with moxifloxacin, isoniazid and rifampin. Nineteen patients, a control group, were observed for the same period under therapy with streptomycin, pirazinamide, rifampin, isoniazid. The patients were affected by indolent miliary pattern and concomitant lymphoma or leukemia in 3 cases; rare nodular involvement with genitourinary diseases in 3 others; segmental to lobar involvement in 4 others with concomitant multidrug resistance, bone localization, hepatitis. The control group was more uniform and showed segmental to lobar nodular involvement with pleuritis in 3 patients, together with hepatitis in 3. Monthly checks of blood gas analysis, chest X-ray, functional testing, serum titers of antibodies against antigen 60, sputum slides and complete chemical analysis were performed. A follow-up visit was performed 1 month after therapy. Patients under moxifloxacin therapy experienced no toxicity, almost complete sterilization and remission of the disease. Sterilization was obtained in 15 days. Patients under standard therapy also had a good clinical outcome, although therapy was delayed in 3 cases because of increased transaminases within the first 15 days of therapy.

Current methods such as immunoblotting or allergen-specific EUSA are non-functional assays and cannot be used to evaluate the biological allergenic activity of allergen products. We have established an in vitro assay based on polyclonal murine IgE and allergen-dependent mediator release of rat basophilic leukaemia (RBL) cells as an alternative to passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA), an animal model of IgE-mediated allergic reactions. The RBL assay is a functional in vitro test which enables the measurement of biological potency of allergen extracts to be made. Up to now, allergen-specific IgE-containing murine sera were used for sensitisation of RBL cells. Sensitisation with allergen-specific IgE monoclonal antibodies (IgE mAbs) would reduce the number of animals necessary for the production of allergen-specific IgE. In addition, IgE mAbs are better defined and will offer more exact determination of allergens. Since allergen-specific IgE mAbs were not available, the aim of this study was to produce such antibodies. As a new strategy to select IgE-producing hybridomas the RBL mediator release assay was used: the cells were incubated with hybridoma supernatant and stimulated with allergen and crosslinking allergen-specific polyclonal IgG antibodies. By this technology IgE mAbs specific for the birch pollen allergens Bet v 1 and Bet v 6 were produced. In conclusion, this novel strategy enables the production of panels of allergen-specific IgE mAbs by immunisation of a limited number of mice to be made. These IgE mAbs in combination with the RBL mediator release assay may serve as new tools for the evaluation of diagnostic and therapeutic allergen extracts.","['Kaul, S', 'Fotisch, K', 'Karamloo, F', 'Vieths, S', 'Hoffmann, A']","['Kaul S', 'Fotisch K', 'Karamloo F', 'Vieths S', 'Hoffmann A']","['Department of Allergology, Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Dev Biol (Basel),Developments in biologicals,100940058,IM,"['Allergens/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', '*Animal Use Alternatives', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, Plant', 'Betula/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology/metabolism', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Plant Proteins/*immunology/metabolism', 'Pollen/immunology']",,2003/04/08 05:00,2003/07/04 05:00,['2003/04/08 05:00'],"['2003/04/08 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/04 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/08 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Dev Biol (Basel). 2002;111:109-15.,,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Plant)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '126161-14-6 (Bet v 1 allergen, Betula)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cord blood has been reported to be useful as a source of stem cell transplantation for the treatment of leukemia and genetic disease. Furthermore, autologous cord-blood transfusions (ACBT) have been reported to be effective for the treatment of anemia in premature infants. The authors examined the efficacy of ACBT in neonatal surgical patients. METHODS: Autologous cord-blood was stored from 12 infants at delivery, including 2 transvaginal and 10 cesarean section deliveries, from 1998 to 2001. All infants had surgically correctable malformations diagnosed antenatally. The mean gestational age was 37.2 +/- 1.6 weeks, and the birth weight was 2,597 +/- 1.6 g. The results of the blood count, serum electrolyte, and liver function tests of the patients who underwent ACBT only (group 1, n = 7) were compared with those of the 7 neonates who underwent an allogenic transfusion during the same period (group 2, n = 7). RESULTS: The mean volume of the stored blood was 64 +/- 35.6 g (range, 20 to 100). Eleven of the 12 patients underwent transfusions. Ten of 11 patients received autologous cord blood. A mean of 44.1 +/- 37.3 g of cord blood was used. Three of 10 cases also required an allotransfusion because of ECMO circuit preparation and a shortage of the stored blood. One patient underwent allotransfusion only. As a result, 7 of 11 babies (64%) who required transfusion were able to avoid an allotransfusion. The blood potassium levels were lower in group 1 than in group 2. No significant complications were recognized clinically. CONCLUSIONS: ACBT is considered beneficial because it enables neonatal surgical patients to avoid allotransfusions. Therefore, autologous cord-blood storage should be considered in the patients antenatally diagnosed to have surgical malformations. However, the storage volume varies for each case. Improved techniques to obtain an adequate amount of blood also should be developed.","['Taguchi, Tomoaki', 'Suita, Sachiyo', 'Nakamura, Masatoshi', 'Yamanouchi, Takeshi', 'Ogita, Keiko', 'Taguchi, Shohei', 'Uesugi, Toru', 'Nakano, Hitoo', 'Inaba, Shoichi']","['Taguchi T', 'Suita S', 'Nakamura M', 'Yamanouchi T', 'Ogita K', 'Taguchi S', 'Uesugi T', 'Nakano H', 'Inaba S']","['Department of Pediatric Surgery, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University and The Transfusion Service, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['*Blood Loss, Surgical', 'Blood Preservation', '*Blood Transfusion, Autologous', 'Congenital Abnormalities/blood/diagnostic imaging/*surgery', 'Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation', '*Fetal Blood', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Prenatal']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/jpsu.2003.50131 [doi]', 'S0022346802631409 [pii]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2003 Apr;38(4):604-7. doi: 10.1053/jpsu.2003.50131.,,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,,"['Copyright 2003, Elsevier Science (USA).

However, there is no literature that describes the complications that occur at the time of removal of these lines. METHODS: A retrospective review of 136 central line (Broviacs [B], Port-A- Caths [PC] and Hickmans [HC]) removals during the last 5 years was undertaken. RESULTS: A total of 97% were removed after completion of chemotherapy, and 3% because of sepsis or malfunction. Three PC lines broke at the time of removal resulting in a length of line remaining in the central venous system (the superior vena cava, innominate vein, and bracheo-cephalic subclavian junction). Two lines were inserted by a cut-down technique into the external jugular and one line by the percutaneous technique into the subclavian vein.

MDR cells can be sensitized to anticancer drugs when treated concomitantly with an MDR modulator. In this study, we investigated whether or not ginseng saponins could reverse MDR mediated by Pgp or MRP. The chemosensitization and drug accumulation effects of ginseng saponins such as the total saponin, protopanaxadiol ginsenosides (PDG), protopanaxatriol ginsenosides (PTG), ginsenosides-Rb 1, -Rb 2, -Rc, -Rg 1 and -Re were tested on the daunorubicin- and doxorubicin-resistant acute myelogenous leukemia sublines (AML-2/D100 and AML-2/DX100), which overexpress Pgp and MRP, respectively. PTG showed cytotoxicity in both sublines and was able to reverse resistance in the AML-2/D100 subline in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, other ginseng saponins at concentrations less than 300 microg/mL showed neither cytotoxicity nor chemosensitizing activity in both resistant sublines. Flow cytometry analysis showed that the effect of PTG (100 microg/mL) on drug accumulation of daunorubicin in the AML-2/D100 subline was 2-fold higher than that observed in the presence of verapamil (5 microg/mL) and 1.5 times less than cyclosporin A (3 microg/mL). The maximum non-cytotoxic concentrations of PTG did not appear to increase the Pgp levels, which is in contrast to verapamil and cyclosporin A. PTG at 200 microg/mL or more completely inhibited the azidopine photolabeling of Pgp. The results suggest that PTG has a chemosensitizing effect on Pgp-mediated MDR cells by increasing the intracellular accumulation of drugs through direct interaction with Pgp at the azidopine site. In addition, PTG may have a beneficial effect on cancer chemotherapy with respect to the possibility of long-term use without the concern of Pgp activation.","['Choi, Cheol-Hee', 'Kang, Gil', 'Min, Young-Don']","['Choi CH', 'Kang G', 'Min YD']","['Department of Pharmacology, College of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, Korea. chchoi@mail.chosun.ac.kr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Panax', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Preparations/*pharmacology', 'Sapogenins/pharmacology', 'Triterpenes/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-38483 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2003 Mar;69(3):235-40. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-38483.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Sapogenins)', '0 (Triterpenes)', '34080-08-5 (protopanaxatriol)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report, we investigated if the pyranocoumarins, (+/-)-4'- O-acetyl-3'- O-angeloyl- cis-khellactone (or angular pyranocoumarin, APC) isolated from the medicinal plant Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn, could induce human acute myeloid leukemic HL-60 cells to differentiate and elucidated the molecular mechanism(s) involved. The ability of HL-60 cells to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) was significantly increased after APC treatment for 72 h. In these differentiating HL-60 cells, cell surface differentiation markers CD11b (for myeloid cells) and CD14 (for monocytic cells) were detected in 90.3 % and 70.1 % of the cells, respectively. The differentiation inducing effect of APC was time- and dose-dependent. Treatment with 20 microg/mL APC for 72 h inhibited cell growth by 90 % and cell cycle analysis revealed an increase in the proportion of G1 phase cells. In these growth-inhibited cells the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 kip1, but not p21 WAF1, was up-regulated as shown by Western blotting. Differentiation inducing signal pathways were investigated and it was shown that phospho-MEK and phospho-ERK were elevated shortly after the addition of APC. Pre-incubation of the cells with MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 blocked this APC-induced differentiation. Our results suggest that APC are potent inducers of HL-60 cell differentiation along both the myelocytic and monocytic lineages and are potential agents for differentiation-treatment of leukemia.","['Zhang, Jin-Xia', 'Fong, Wang-Fun', 'Wu, Jimmy Yiu-Cheong', 'Yang, Mengsu', 'Cheung, Hon-Yeung']","['Zhang JX', 'Fong WF', 'Wu JY', 'Yang M', 'Cheung HY']","['Bioactive Products Research Group, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Planta Med,Planta medica,0066751,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', '*Apiaceae', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/pathology', '*Phytotherapy', 'Plant Preparations/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyranocoumarins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/metabolism']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2003-38490 [doi]'],ppublish,Planta Med. 2003 Mar;69(3):223-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2003-38490.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Plant Preparations)', '0 (Pyranocoumarins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The apoptotic function of E2F-1 is dependent on its ability to bind DNA; cyclin A kinase activity has been shown to negatively regulate the DNA-binding capacity of E2F-1. In the present study, we sought to determine whether cyclin A kinase activity is involved in mediating the interaction between E2F-1 and chemotherapeutic agents in colon cancer cells. Therefore, human colon adenocarcinoma (SW620) cells were treated with an adenovirus expressing E2F-1 (Ad-E2F-1, multiplicity of infection 20). Immediately following infection, a panel of conventional chemotherapeutic agents with varying modes of cytotoxic action were administered at LD(25 )doses. Three days following treatment, viability and growth inhibition were determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. Apoptosis was confirmed using cellular morphology, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and flow-cytometric analysis. E2F-1 overexpression and cyclin A protein expression were monitored by immunoblot, and cyclin A kinase activity was determined by kinase assay. Vincristine (VIN), camptothecin (CPT), and actinomycin D were found to have a cooperative (>38% over the additive single therapy values) effect on E2F-1-mediated apoptosis. Etoposide, cisplatin (CIS), and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) showed the least cooperation (<or=11.5% over the additive single therapy values) with E2F-1. Ad-E2F-1 treatment alone results in 3.4-fold increase of cyclin A kinase activity compared to Ad-LacZ control (p < 0.05); when combined with chemotherapeutic agents, cyclin A kinase activity was inhibited significantly by VIN, actinomycin D, and etoposide (p < 0.005), but not with CPT, CIS, and 5-FU (p > 0.1) compared to Ad-E2F-1 treatment alone. Combination of Ad-LacZ/5-FU and Ad-LacZ/actinomycin D significantly inhibited cyclin A kinase activity compared to Ad-LacZ treatment alone (p < 0.005). No other Ad-LacZ/drug combinations significantly affected cyclin A kinase activity (p > 0.05). In conclusion, combinations of E2F-1 adenovirus and VIN, CPT, or actinomycin D at LD(25 )had significant cooperative effects on colon cancer apoptotic cell death in vitro. Although inhibition of cyclin A kinase activity was observed in most Ad-E2F-1/drug combination treatments compared to Ad-E2F-1 treatment alone, there was no consistent correlation between degree of inhibition of cyclin A kinase activity and the cooperative effect. Nonetheless, inhibition of cyclin A kinase activity may be an important mechanism by which the chemogene therapy effects involving E2F-1 are modulated.","['Elliott, Mary Jane', 'Baker, James D', 'Dong, Yan Bin', 'Yang, Hai Liang', 'Gleason, John F Jr', 'McMasters, Kelly M']","['Elliott MJ', 'Baker JD', 'Dong YB', 'Yang HL', 'Gleason JF Jr', 'McMasters KM']","['Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Adenoviruses, Human/genetics', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy/*pathology/therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclin A/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'E2F Transcription Factors', 'E2F1 Transcription Factor', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology/virology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/08/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2002/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1159/000069791 [doi]', '69791 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2002 Nov-Dec;23(6):324-36. doi: 10.1159/000069791.,['R01 CA9078-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin A)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2F Transcription Factors)', '0 (E2F1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (E2F1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Therefore, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to identify the pattern of dexamethasone-induced changes in gene expression in two well characterized models of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, the murine lymphoma cell lines S49.A2 and WEHI7.2. Dexamethasone treatment induced a diverse set of gene changes that evolved over a 24-h period preceding the onset of cell death. These include previously reported changes in the expression of genes regulating prosurvival signals mediated by c-Myc and NFkappaB. Unexpectedly, we discovered that glucocorticoid treatment increases expression of the gene encoding Bim, a BH3-only member of the Bcl-2 family that is capable of directly activating the apoptotic cascade. Induction of Bim was confirmed by immunoblotting not only in S49.A2 and WEHI7.2 cells but also in the human leukemia cell line CEM-C7 and in primary murine thymocytes. All three prototypical isoforms of Bim (BimEL, BimL, and BimS) were induced by dexamethasone. Because elevated expression of Bim initiates the execution phase of cell death, this report that Bim is induced by dexamethasone provides novel insight into the mechanism through which glucocorticoid-mediated changes in gene expression induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells.","['Wang, Zhengqi', 'Malone, Michael H', 'He, Huiling', 'McColl, Karen S', 'Distelhorst, Clark W']","['Wang Z', 'Malone MH', 'He H', 'McColl KS', 'Distelhorst CW']","['Departments of Medicine and Pharmacology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA Fingerprinting/methods', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/08/21 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M301843200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)86196-1 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 27;278(26):23861-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M301843200.

Currently, clinical studies are investigating arsenic as a therapeutic agent for a variety of malignancies. In this study, Hodgkin/Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cell lines served as model systems to characterize the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in arsenic-induced apoptosis. Arsenic rapidly down-regulated constitutive IkappaB kinase (IKK) as well as NF-kappaB activity and induced apoptosis in HRS cell lines containing functional IkappaB proteins. In these cell lines, apoptosis was blocked by inhibition of caspase-8 and caspase-3-like activity. Furthermore, arsenic treatment down-regulated NF-kappaB target genes, including tumor necrosis factor-alphareceptor-associated factor 1 (TRAF1), c-IAP2, interleukin-13 (IL-13), and CCR7. In contrast, cell lines with mutated, functionally inactive IkappaB proteins or with a weak constitutive IKK/NF-kappaB activity showed no alteration of the NF-kappaB activity and were resistant to arsenic-induced apoptosis. A direct role of the NF-kappaB pathway in arsenic-induced apoptosis is shown by transient overexpression of NF-kappaB-p65 in L540Cy HRS cells, which protected the cells from arsenic-induced apoptosis. In addition, treatment of NOD/SCID mice with arsenic trioxide induced a dramatic reduction of xenotransplanted L540Cy Hodgkin tumors concomitant with NF-kappaB inhibition. We conclude that inhibition of NF-kappaB contributes to arsenic-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of the IKK/NF-kappaB activity might be a powerful treatment option for Hodgkin lymphoma.","['Mathas, Stephan', 'Lietz, Andreas', 'Janz, Martin', 'Hinz, Michael', 'Jundt, Franziska', 'Scheidereit, Claus', 'Bommert, Kurt', 'Dorken, Bernd']","['Mathas S', 'Lietz A', 'Janz M', 'Hinz M', 'Jundt F', 'Scheidereit C', 'Bommert K', 'Dorken B']","['Max-Delbruck-Center for Molecular Medicine, FG Dorken, Robert-Rossle-Str. 10, D-13125 Berlin, Germany. mathas@rrk-berlin.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/pharmacology', 'Arsenites/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hodgkin Disease/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-kappa B/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxides/pharmacology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Sodium Compounds/pharmacology', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-04-1154 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50585-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1028-34. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-04-1154.

DLI, applied immediately after BMT, induced GVH disease (GVHD), but when DLI was delayed for 3 weeks, GVHD was avoided while a distinct GVL response was allowed to develop. A population of Mac1+Ly6-G+Ly6-C+ immature myeloid cells, found in small numbers in normal mice, strongly expanded in spleens of chimeras, reaching a maximum level at week 3 and returning to base level by week 12. Upon isolation, these cells exhibited interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-dependent, nitric oxide (NO)-mediated suppressor activity toward in vitro alloresponses, suggesting that, after in vivo DLI, they are activated by IFN-gamma to produce NO and suppress GVH reactivity. Because not only alloactivated T-cell proliferation but also leukemia cell growth was found susceptible to inhibition by exogenous NO, in vivo activation of these cells after DLI may explain the occurrence of a GVL effect despite suppression of GVHD. This suggested sequence of events was supported by the finding that the ex vivo antihost proliferative response of spleen cells, recovered shortly after in vivo DLI, was characterized by strong mRNA production of the monokines interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Our data suggest that transiently expanding Mac1+Ly6-G+Ly6-C+ immature myeloid cells (probably as a result of extramedullary myelopoiesis) may play a role in controlling GVH while promoting GVL reactivity of DLI after allogeneic BMT.","['Billiau, An D', 'Fevery, Sabine', 'Rutgeerts, Omer', 'Landuyt, Willy', 'Waer, Mark']","['Billiau AD', 'Fevery S', 'Rutgeerts O', 'Landuyt W', 'Waer M']","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/*analysis', 'Cell Division', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'H-2 Antigens/immunology', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/*analysis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Myeloid Cells/chemistry/*immunology', 'Nitric Oxide/physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Radiation Chimera', 'S-Nitrosoglutathione/pharmacology', 'Spleen/*cytology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/genetics']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1833 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44400-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):740-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1833.

Twelve (9%) of 131 unselected T-cell acute lymphoid leukemias (T-ALLs) expressed CALM-AF10 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction or fluorescence in situ hybridization (or both), including 8% of children and 10% of adults, of whom only half demonstrated a t(10;11) by classical cytogenetics. CALM-AF10 was not found in T-cell-receptor alphabeta (TCRalphabeta) lineage T-ALLs, as defined by expression of TCRalphabeta, cytoplasmic TCRbeta, or TCRbetaVDJ rearrangement in immature cytoplasmic TCRbeta- cases, compared with 19% of TCRgammadelta T-ALLs and 33% of immature delta/gamma T-ALLs. The latter differed from their CALM-AF10- immature counterparts by a CD5+/CD2-phenotype, as found in TCRgammadelta but not TCRalphabeta T-ALLs and in their TCRgamma and TCRdelta configurations, altogether suggesting that CALM-AF10+ immature delta/gammaT-ALLs are TCRgammadelta precursors and that, within T-ALL, CALM-AF10 is specific for this lineage. Nine of 12 immature CALM-AF10 T-ALLs demonstrated 3' fusion transcripts, whereas 6 of 7 TCRgammadelta T-ALLs demonstrated 5' fusion transcripts. The latter retain the AF10 extended LAP/PHD domain necessary for homo-oligomerization. All 8 patients with CALM-AF10+TCRgammadelta T-ALLs are alive, compared with only 3 of 12 with immature CALM-AF10+ T-ALLs. Six CALM-AF10+ non-T acute leukemias all expressed CD7 and demonstrated T-restricted TCRdelta rearrangements, suggesting that they may also be related to the TCRgammadelta lineage. CALM-AF10 is therefore the most common fusion protein in T-ALL. It requires molecular and immunophenotypic characterization for appropriate prognostic evaluation and should be included in diagnostic screening panels of T-ALL and immature acute leukemias. Analysis of immature CALM-AF10+ leukemias will also facilitate analysis of the early stages of development of the TCRgammadelta lineage.","['Asnafi, Vahid', 'Radford-Weiss, Isabelle', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Bayle, Chantal', 'Leboeuf, Daniel', 'Charrin, Christiane', 'Garand, Richard', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, Marina', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Buzyn, Agnes', 'Troussard, Xavier', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Asnafi V', 'Radford-Weiss I', 'Dastugue N', 'Bayle C', 'Leboeuf D', 'Charrin C', 'Garand R', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Delabesse E', 'Buzyn A', 'Troussard X', 'Macintyre E']","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Service d'Histologie, Embryologie, et de Cytogenetic, Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Necker Enfants Malades and University Paris V, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", ""5' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*genetics', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, gamma-delta', 'Survival Rate', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-09-2913 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50581-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1000-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-09-2913.

The clinical trial reported here was undertaken to test the hypothesis that fludarabine can replace cyclophosphamide in this regimen and facilitate donor engraftment with reduced toxicity. The conditioning regimen consisted of 30 mg/m2 intravenous fludarabine daily from day -9 to day -6, and oral busulfan given at 1 mg/kg 4 times a day every 6 hours from day -5 to day -2, with doses adjusted to target plasma levels of 900 +/- 100 ng/mL at steady state. Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis for graft-versus-host disease. Enrolled were 42 patients with high-risk CML (n = 4) or MDS (n = 38). The median patient age was 52 years (range, 12-65 years). Mobilized blood stem cells were obtained from HLA-compatible siblings (n = 16) or unrelated donors (n = 26). Engraftment was achieved in all patients, and the day-100 regimen-related mortality was 7%. With a median follow-up of 18 months (range, 13-27 months), the probabilities of overall survival, disease-free survival, and nonrelapse mortality were 42.4%, 34.9%, and 24%, respectively. These data indicate that the combination of fludarabine and targeted busulfan is sufficiently immunosuppressive to facilitate engraftment of blood stem cells from HLA-matched siblings and unrelated donors.

In the present study, 20 patients with highly stable CLL observed at a single institution over a period of 10 to 23 years and who never required treatment were extensively characterized. The aim was to identify a distinct and reproducible biologic profile associated with disease stability that may be used to recognize at presentation CLL patients who are likely to have a very benign clinical course and for whom treatment is not indicated. The results obtained indicate that numerous parameters are closely associated with disease stability: a typical CLL morphology and immunophenotype, the lack of expression of the CD38 antigen, the mutated immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy (H) chain variable (V) pattern, the absence of p53 mutations, a CD4/CD8 ratio more than 1, the lack of 17p and 11q deletions and of complex karyotypic aberrations, and the occurrence of the 13q14 deletion. No case displayed the VH3-21 gene, linked in mutated CLL with a poor outcome. In addition, the VH1-69 gene associated with unmutated CLL cases was never detected. These biologic features were coupled with an indolent clinical course characterized by an unmodified clinical stage over time, and by lack of autoimmune phenomena and of major infections requiring parental antibiotics. At a time when aggressive therapeutic strategies are always more frequently used in the management of CLL, the distinctive features of patients with long-lived stable disease should be prospectively identified at presentation.","['Guarini, Anna', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Capello, Daniela', 'Mancini, Francesca', 'De Propris, Maria Stefania', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Orsini, Enrica', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Castoldi, Gianluigi', 'Foa, Robert']","['Guarini A', 'Gaidano G', 'Mauro FR', 'Capello D', 'Mancini F', 'De Propris MS', 'Mancini M', 'Orsini E', 'Gentile M', 'Breccia M', 'Cuneo A', 'Castoldi G', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sezione di Ematologia, Via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase/analysis', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Biomarkers', 'CD4-CD8 Ratio', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Survivors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3639 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50586-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):1035-41. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3639.

When the frequency of patients with granulocyte clonality was compared with respect to the presence of increased PNH-type cells, the frequency was significantly lower in AA patients with (PNH+; 21.2%) than without (PNH-; 42.9%) increased numbers of PNH-type cells (P =.049). Clonality was absent in granulocytes from the 15 PNH+ RA patients but present in 13 of 29 (44.8%) PNH- RA patients (P =.0013).

We analyzed population-based childhood cancer incidence rates in California (USA) from 1988 to 1994, by HAP exposure scores, for all California census tracts. For each census tract, we calculated exposure scores by combining cancer potency factors with outdoor HAP concentrations modeled by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We evaluated the relationship between childhood cancer rates and exposure scores for 25 potentially carcinogenic HAPs emitted from mobile, area, and point sources and from all sources combined. Our study period saw 7,143 newly diagnosed cancer cases in California; of these, 6,989 (97.8%) could be assigned to census tracts and included in our analysis. Using Poisson regression, we estimated rate ratios (RRs) adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sex. We found little evidence for elevated cancer RRs for all sites or for gliomas among children living in high-ranking combined-source exposure areas. We found elevated RRs and a significant trend with increasing exposure level for childhood leukemia in tracts ranked highest for exposure to the combined group of 25 HAPs (RR = 1.21; 95% confidence interval, 1.03, 1.42) and in tracts ranked highest for point-source HAP exposure (RR = 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.11, 1.57).

Human studies have demonstrated clear increases in cancer after prenatal exposure to ionizing radiation, and there is suggestive evidence that brain tumors and leukemia are associated with parental exposures to chemicals. Animal experiments have demonstrated increased tumor formation induced by prenatal or neonatal exposure to a variety of chemicals, including direct-acting carcinogens and drugs. Recently, natural estrogens have been classified as known human carcinogens. Prenatal exposure to natural and synthetic estrogens is associated with increases in breast and vaginal tumors in humans as well as uterine tumors in animals. Synthetic halogenated chemicals increase liver tumors after early life-stage exposure. Recently, a prototypical endocrine-disrupting compound, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, has been shown to be a developmental toxicant of the mammary gland in rodents. Dioxin alters multiple endocrine systems, and its effects on the developing breast involve delayed proliferation and differentiation of the mammary gland, as well as an elongation of the window of sensitivity to potential carcinogens. Implications of these new findings suggest that causes of endocrine-related cancers or susceptibility to cancer may be a result of developmental exposures rather than exposures existing at or near the time of tumor detection.","['Birnbaum, Linda S', 'Fenton, Suzanne E']","['Birnbaum LS', 'Fenton SE']","['Experimental Toxicology Division, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Office of Research and Development, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA. birnbaum.linda@epa.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Atrazine/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child', '*Child Development', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dioxins/adverse effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Endocrine System/*drug effects', 'Environmental Pollutants/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Herbicides/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Animal/etiology', 'Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Rodentia', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/etiology']",76,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/07/16 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.5686 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 2003 Apr;111(4):389-94. doi: 10.1289/ehp.5686.,,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dioxins)', '0 (Environmental Pollutants)', '0 (Herbicides)', 'QJA9M5H4IM (Atrazine)']",,PMC1241417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that nucleosomal targeting by MOZ and recruitment of CBP by TIF2 are critical requirements for MOZ-TIF2 transformation and indicate that MOZ gain of function contributes to leukemogenesis.","['Deguchi, Kenji', 'Ayton, Paul M', 'Carapeti, Melina', 'Kutok, Jeffery L', 'Snyder, Cynthia S', 'Williams, Ifor R', 'Cross, Nicholas C P', 'Glass, Christopher K', 'Cleary, Michael L', 'Gilliland, D Gary']","['Deguchi K', 'Ayton PM', 'Carapeti M', 'Kutok JL', 'Snyder CS', 'Williams IR', 'Cross NC', 'Glass CK', 'Cleary ML', 'Gilliland DG']","[""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Harvard Institutes, of Medicine, 4 Blackfan Circle, Room 420, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Cell,Cancer cell,101130617,IM,"['Acetyltransferases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2', 'Nucleosomes/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/09/17 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1535610803000515 [pii]', '10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00051-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Cell. 2003 Mar;3(3):259-71. doi: 10.1016/s1535-6108(03)00051-5.,"['CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK50654/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (NCOA2 protein, human)', '0 (Ncoa2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.- (Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (KAT6A protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular interactions at the embryo-maternal interface during the time of adhesion and subsequent invasion are crucial to the process of embryonic implantation. Both partners, the mother as well as the embryo, play equal roles in the embryo-maternal dialogue, the embryonic part being the main topic in this study. Investigations of the proteins in the extra-embryonic matrices (i.e. zona pellucida) indicate that the embryo participates intensively in this early embryo-maternal signalling. One unique feature during implantation process of primate embryos is the release of chorionic gonadotrophin, which seems to influence endometrial activity by two different mechanisms: (i) luteotrophic activity with increasing progesterone release and (ii) a direct action on the endometrium. Furthermore, embryonic interleukin-1beta may be involved in embryo-maternal signalling. Other significant signals in this interaction are most likely leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and colony-stimulating factor (CSF), which stimulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)/insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) activity and the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, which is modulated by embryonic IGFBP-3. Similar significances are discussed for uteroglobin and haptoglobin. Finally, the phenomenon of maternal immunological tolerance, triggered by the presence of the early embryo, is fundamental to the understanding of implantation and trophoblast invasion. A tightly regulated balance between activated and inactivated T cells at the implantation site may control the beginning of adequate trophoblast invasion and also limit this invasion to a tolerable extent for the maternal system, consequently ensuring a biologically healthy haemo-chorial placenta.","['Herrler, Andreas', 'von Rango, Ulrike', 'Beier, Henning M']","['Herrler A', 'von Rango U', 'Beier HM']","['Department of Anatomy and Reproductive Biology, Medical School, RWTH University of Aachen, 52074 Aachen, Germany. aherrier@ukaachen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Reprod Biomed Online,Reproductive biomedicine online,101122473,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chorionic Gonadotropin/*metabolism', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Cytokines/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Embryo, Mammalian/physiology', 'Endometrium/pathology', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Haptoglobins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1/metabolism', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3/metabolism', 'Interleukin-1/metabolism', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Molecular', 'Placenta/physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatomedins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Uteroglobin/chemistry']",85,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/10/03 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1472-6483(10)61717-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1472-6483(10)61717-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Biomed Online. 2003 Mar;6(2):244-56. doi: 10.1016/s1472-6483(10)61717-8.,,"['0 (Chorionic Gonadotropin)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Haptoglobins)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 1)', '0 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Somatomedins)', '9060-09-7 (Uteroglobin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, we describe clinicopathological, histological, immunophenotypical and genetic findings of RS. The patients with RS, regardless of transformation of pre-existing clone or de novo malignant clone, were resistant to conventional combined chemotherapy and died within months of diagnosis. Molecular techniques can provide convincing results for the clonal relationship of RS to pre-existing B-CLL. When RS carries a same rearrangement band or a same sequence as B-CLL by Southern blotting or nucleotide sequence analyses of immunoglobulin heavy and/or light chain genes, it is suggested to that RS transforms from original B-CLL. These analyses have showed that approximately two-thirds of RS cases evolved from a B-CLL clone. How and where does the B-CLL clone evolve to RS? The genetic alteration of transforming B-CLL clone into RS has been addressed. Abnormalities of chromosomes 11 and 14 were most frequently involved in RS, but non-specific. In addition, RS does not include chromosomal translocation between Ig locus and oncogenes or rearrangements of bcl-6 gene, both of which were found in some de novo DLBCL. Several candidates, such as mutation of p53 gene and abnormalities of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, have been proposed to play an important role in the transformation of a part of B-CLL. However, there is still uncertainty as to how B-CLL progresses or develops into RS.","['Nakamura, Naoya', 'Abe, Masafumi']","['Nakamura N', 'Abe M']","['Department of Pathology, Fukushima Medical University School of Medicine, 1-Hikarigaoka, Fukushima-shi, 960-1295, Japan. nao@fmu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Australia,Pathol Int,Pathology international,9431380,IM,"['Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",84,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/12/31 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1320-5463.2003.01455.x [doi]'],ppublish,Pathol Int. 2003 Apr;53(4):195-203. doi: 10.1046/j.1320-5463.2003.01455.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective analysis was performed to evaluate the utilization and risk factors for RBC transfusions including age and sex of recipient, HLA matching between donor and recipient, disease status at time of BMT, the occurrence of GVHD, ABO blood group compatibility, the source of progenitor cells and the Hb level before BMT (PT-Hb). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 519 consecutive patients receiving transplants between January 1995 and March 2000 were reviewed. The number of RBC transfusions was determined for the following periods: 0 to 60, 61 to 120, and 121 to 180 days after BMT. RESULTS: The transfusion requirements were greatest during the first 60 days after BMT and decreased with time. The total number of units transfused to this cohort of patients was 5398, of which 3505 units were utilized within the first 2 months. The mean number +/- SD of units transfused per patient from 0 to 60 days was 6.8 +/- 6.4; 61 to 120 days, 3.2 +/- 5.5; and 121 to 180 days, 2.0 +/- 4.6. An increased transfusion requirement was associated with lower PT-Hb, major ABO mismatch between donor and recipient, BMT in patients with more advanced disease, use of unrelated donors, older age, and female sex by Spearman's correlation analysis. The source of progenitor cells and the development of GVHD did not influence transfusion requirements. Increased mortality during the 6-month period after transplant was associated with lower PT-Hb, use of unrelated donors, advanced disease status at BMT, and sex by Cox regression analysis. In a multivariate model, PT-Hb remained significant when controlling for the other risk factors. CONCLUSION: The PT-Hb was identified as an independent risk factor for RBC transfusions during alloBMT. As well, a lower PT-Hb was found to be an independent risk factor for increased mortality during the 6-month study period.","['Xenocostas, Anargyros', 'Yee, Angelina', 'Wong, Cindy J', 'Sutton, David M C', 'Lipton, Jeffrey H', 'Kiss, Thomas L', 'Messner, Hans A']","['Xenocostas A', 'Yee A', 'Wong CJ', 'Sutton DM', 'Lipton JH', 'Kiss TL', 'Messner HA']","['Hematology Division, London Health Sciences Center, University of Western Ontario, Canada. anargyros.xenocosta@lhsc.on.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion/adverse effects/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/epidemiology', 'Hemoglobins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['trf339 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00339.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2003 Mar;43(3):373-82. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00339.x.,,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The percentage of platelet recovery was measured after prophylactic transfusion of apheresis units divided from single donors to paired recipients with uncomplicated thrombocytopenia secondary to leukemia chemotherapy. Platelet microaggregation induced by citrate was measured at the time of apheresis. RESULTS: Platelet recoveries in paired recipients correlated strongly when both transfusions were ABO- identical. When one recipient was ABO-identical and the other was ABO-nonidentical, nonidentical transfusions yielded one-third the recovery of ABO-identical transfusions. In ABO-identical transfusions, platelet recovery in donors having microaggregates in the before-apheresis ACD sample was one-third that in donors without microaggregates. This difference was observed at 1 and 24 hours. Expression of P-selectin in the apheresis units at the time of transfusion correlated well with ACD microaggregates in the before-apheresis sample. CONCLUSION: When transfusions of platelets are ABO-identical, donor quality dominates recovery in circulation. Donor quality is predicted by a rapid and simple assay of citrate-induced microaggregation performed at the time of apheresis. When donor quality is factored out, ABO identity prevails.","['Jimenez, Teresa M', 'Patel, Sachin B', 'Pineda, Alvaro A', 'Tefferi, Ayalew', 'Owen, Whyte G']","['Jimenez TM', 'Patel SB', 'Pineda AA', 'Tefferi A', 'Owen WG']","['Section of Hematology Research, Division of Transfusion Medicine and Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Mayo Clinics and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Blood Component Removal', '*Blood Donors', 'Blood Grouping and Crossmatching', 'Citric Acid', 'Edetic Acid', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glucose/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Male', 'P-Selectin/blood', 'Platelet Aggregation', '*Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced/therapy', 'Time Factors']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']","['trf326 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00326.x [doi]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 2003 Mar;43(3):328-34. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.2003.00326.x.,,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (P-Selectin)', '13838-07-8 (acid citrate dextrose)', '2968PHW8QP (Citric Acid)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within 5 min of exposure to pH 4 about 95% of the viruses lost infectiousness. The viruses were completely inactivated after exposure to pH < 3 or pH >11 for 5 min. The inactivation of MoMuLV was irreversible. Electron microscopy revealed that ecotropic MoMuLV remained round-shaped at pH between 7.0 and 5. They became irregular with a convex head at pH < 4. At pH 2, virtually all virion particles were penetrated by stains, causing the accumulation of heavy metals inside the particles. The penetration of heavy metal inside the particles indicated the disassociation of the lipid bilayer of the viruses at low pH.

Here, we describe the characterization of Hsp70-NK cell interaction with binding studies using the human NK cell line YT. Binding of recombinant Hsp70 protein (Hsp70) and the C-terminal domain of Hsp70 (Hsp70C) to YT cells is demonstrated by immunofluorescence studies. A phenotypic characterization revealed that none of the recently described HSP-receptors (alpha2-macroglobulin receptor CD91, Toll-like receptors 2, 4, 9, CD14) are expressed on YT cells. Only the C-type lectin receptor CD94 is commonly expressed by YT cells and Hsp70 reactive NK cells. A correlation of the cell density-dependent, variable CD94 expression and the binding capacity of Hsp70 was detected. Furthermore, Hsp70 binding could be completely abrogated by preincubation of YT cells with a CD94-specific antibody. Competition assays using either unlabeled Hsp70 protein or an unrelated protein (GST) in 20-fold excess and binding studies with escalating doses of Hsp70 protein provide evidence for a specific and concentration-dependent interaction of Hsp70 with YT cells. In addition to Hsp70 and Hsp70C, a 14-mer Hsp70 peptide termed TKD is known to exhibit comparable stimulatory properties on NK cells. Similar to full-length Hsp70 protein (10 microg/ml-50 microg/ml), a specific binding of this peptide to YT cells was observed at 4 degrees C, at equivalent concentrations (2.0 microg/ml-8.0 microg/ml). Following a 30 min incubation period at 37 degrees C, membrane-bound Hsp70 protein and Hsp70 peptide TKD were completely taken up into the cytoplasm.","['Gross, Catharina', 'Hansch, Daniel', 'Gastpar, Robert', 'Multhoff, Gabriele']","['Gross C', 'Hansch D', 'Gastpar R', 'Multhoff G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Regensburg, Franz-Josef Strauss Allee 11, D-93053 Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/*metabolism', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cell Count', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glutathione Transferase/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lectins, C-Type/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D', 'Oligopeptides/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2003/10/17 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1515/BC.2003.030 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Chem. 2003 Feb;384(2):267-79. doi: 10.1515/BC.2003.030.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (KLRD1 protein, human)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily D)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In lower vertebrates, a few studies have been conducted on Mphi like cells. In acute monocytic leukemia monocytic cells, as immature cells restrained in one of the phases of their ontogenesis, would offer the opportunity to rebuild an archaic condition helpful to understand the phylogenesis. Therefore, aim of this work was to characterize in the Rainbow trout (Salmo Gairdneri Richardson) Mphi and compare them with acute leukemia monocytic cells. In the trout, Mphi's morphology is similar to that of mammals. In particular, Mphi possess an irregular embryoshaped nucleus occupying 2/3 of the cell, while the peripheral cytoplasmic profile is irregular with extroflexed plasmalemma and pseudopods. A morphological transition towards Mphi is featured by a wavy hyaline classical membrane and an irregular and extroflexed surface. Some aspects of erythrophagocytosis represented a finding of great interest indicating that the hemocatheretic function could take place directly in circulation. This condition, also observed in human acute monocytic leukemia, suggests that the information to the erythrophagocytosis is restrained under physiological conditions. Non-specific esterases, which are positive in human Mphi smear and Mphi from human lymph node tissue, were also positive in the teleost studied but with a dysomogeneous pattern. Consequently non-specific esterase system is phylogenetically conserved. A lack of immune-reactivity with the anti-CD68 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) on smear and trout tissue sections was observed. On the contrary, strong positivity was detected on human lymph node sections. In trout, the presence of Mphi and circulating Mphi like cells exhibiting an erythrocatheretic function in the circulation would indicate a primordial function that has later been replaced by the liver and the spleen.","['Passantino, L', 'Patruno, R', 'Cianciotta, A', 'Passantino, G', 'Tafaro, A', 'Gadaleta, C', 'Ranieri, G']","['Passantino L', 'Patruno R', 'Cianciotta A', 'Passantino G', 'Tafaro A', 'Gadaleta C', 'Ranieri G']","['Department of Animal Health and Welfare, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. anatomia.normale@veterinaria.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,IM,"['Animals', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Histocytochemistry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology/physiology', 'Monocytes/*cytology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Phylogeny', 'Species Specificity', 'Trout/blood/*immunology']",,2003/04/05 05:00,2004/07/22 05:00,['2003/04/05 05:00'],"['2003/04/05 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/07/22 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1081/iph-120018286 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2003 Feb;25(1):87-99. doi: 10.1081/iph-120018286.,,['EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The attitude of sub-G1 peak in DNA histogram was determined by FCM. The TUNEL positive cell percentage was identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated Biotin dUNP end labeling technique. It was found that when HL-60 cells were treated with 25 mumol/L curcumin for 24 h, the expression level of Mcl-1 was down-regulated, but that of Bax and Bak up-regulated time-dependently. There was significant difference in the expression level of Mcl-1, Bax and Bak between the curcumin-treated groups and control group (P < 0.05-0.01). At the same time, curcumin had no effect on progress of cell cycle in primaty acute myelogenous leukemia at newly diagnosis, but could increase the peak of Sub-G1 (P < 0.05), and down-regulate the expression of Mcl-1 and up-regulate the expression of Bax and Bak with the difference being statistically significant. The expression of P27kipl, P21wafl and pRbp- were elevated and that of cyclin D3 decreased in the presence of curcumin. These findings suggested that the Bcl-2 gene family indeed participated in the regulatory process of apoptosis induced by curcumin in HL-60 cells and AML cells. Curcumin can induce apoptosis of primary acute myelogenous leukemic cells and disturb cell cycle progression of HL-60 cells. The mechanism appeared to be mediated by perturbing G0/G1 phases checkpoints which associated with up-regulation of P27kipl, P21wafl and pRbp- expression, and down-regulation of cyclin D3.","['Chen, Yan', 'Wu, Yudan', 'He, Jing', 'Chen, Wenjuan']","['Chen Y', 'Wu Y', 'He J', 'Chen W']","['Institute of Hematology, Xiehe Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci,Journal of Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

The cytotoxicity of the activated PBMC to different target cells was assayed. The results showed that the antigen peptides from different leukemia cell lines, bound with Hsp70, could activate PBMC effectively, and stimulate the activated PBMC to proliferate. The proliferative PBMC had specific cytotoxicity to corresponding leukemia cells. CD8+ cells, accounting for a high proportion in proliferative cells, had a specific cytotoxicity to leukemia cells from which antigen peptides were prepared, suggesting that these CD8+ cells were CTLs specific to leukemia cells.

During embryogenesis, primitive blood vessels are formed de novo by the aggregation of angioblasts, a process that is termed vasculogenesis. In postnatal life, the development of new blood vessels is restricted to the female reproductive tract (during the ovulatory cycle) and to sites of wound healing, and occurs through a process called angiogenesis, i.e. the sprouting of new vessels from the preexisting vasculature. However, neovascularization can also occur under pathological conditions, e.g. tumor cells can ""switch on"" angiogenesis. New blood vessels bring in nutrients and proteins, so the tumor mass can expand. In fact, neovascularization appears to be one of the crucial steps in the transition of a tumor from a small cluster of malignant cells to a visible macroscopic tumor capable of spreading to other organs via the vasculature throughout the body. The association of tumor growth with the development of a vascular network was recognized nearly a century ago. Using a leukemia model, chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), we were able to provide evidence for the existence of a hemangioblastic progenitor cell in the bone marrow of adult humans. Using the pathognomonic BCR-ABL-fusion gene as a genetic marker present in virtually all bone marrow derived cells of patients with CML, we were able to show that endothelial cells belong to the malignant cell clone, since they also contain the BCR-ABL-fusion gene. Our data suggest that CML arises from a hemangioblastic progenitor cell, the progeny of which are malignant blood cells and genotypically clonal endothelial cells. Thus, we provide substantial evidence that indeed a hemangioblast exists in the bone marrow of human adults. In addition, our data imply that normal as well as genotypically malignant bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells can contribute to maintenance angiogenesis in the vascular endothelium, a condition that is consistent with postnatal vasculogenesis. These findings were recently confirmed by other groups and should help in elucidating the pathophysiology of malignant and nonmalignant disorders. The integration of bone-marrow-derived endothelial cells into the vascular endothelium has implications for the development of vascular targeting strategies (e.g., gene therapy) for vascular diseases, inflammatory disorders, and cancer. The characterization of the hemangioblast at a clonal level as well as the translation of these findings into a clinically applicable concept for the delivery of therapeutic genes to malignant tumors is currently in progress in our laboratory.","['Gunsilius, Eberhard']",['Gunsilius E'],"['Tumor-Biology & Angiogenesis Lab., Division of Hematology & Oncology, University Innsbruck, Austria. eberhard.gunsilius@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Lineage/*immunology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/*embryology/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*immunology']",36,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/06/11 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-1-4615-0169-5_3 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2003;522:17-24. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-0169-5_3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interaction of genes, hemoglobin molecules, red cell membrane and metabolic changes, cell-cell interactions and cell-plasma interactions, red cell adhesion to vascular endothelium, activation of coagulation, and vascular reactivity play a role in vasoocclusion. Penicillin prophylaxis of pneumococcal infections and appropriate use of blood transfusions and other supportive measures improved survival of sickle cell patients. Hydroxyurea made a major impact on sickle cell therapy when it was shown to decrease acute painful episodes, acute chest syndrome, and the need for blood transfusion in adults. Significant experience in the use of hydroxyurea has been accumulated in older children. The benefits and risks of hydroxyurea for younger children and long-term risks in all patients will be evaluated in future investigations. Other promising therapies include butyrate compounds, clotrimazole, magnesium supplementation, poloxamer 188, antiadhesion agents, anticoagulant approaches, and nitric oxide. Hemopoietic transplantation remains the only curative therapy. However, several transgenic mouse models are available for studies of gene therapy or other treatment approaches on biochemical, cellular, and pathologic effects of mutant genes.","['Mankad, V N']",['Mankad VN'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington, Kentucky, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Pediatr Pathol Mol Med,Pediatric pathology & molecular medicine,100885435,IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/etiology', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Ischemia/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Leukemia/chemically induced', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk', 'Thrombosis/etiology/physiopathology/prevention & control/therapy']",50,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatr Pathol Mol Med. 2001 Jan-Feb;20(1):1-13.,,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results were compared with a reference group of 1092 persons with no history of cancer (age range, 15-33 years, 55% female). The impact of demographic and medical characteristics on psychosocial adjustment was studied. All participants completed a self-report questionnaire. The results showed that, although many survivors are functioning well and leading normal lives, a subgroup of survivors were less likely to complete high-school, to attain an advanced graduate degree, to follow normal elementary or secondary school and had to be enrolled more often on learning disabled programs. The percentage of employed survivors was lower than the percentage of employed controls in the comparison group, but more survivors were student or homemaker. Survivors had lower rates of marriage and parenthood, and worried more about their fertility and the risk of their children having cancer. Survivors, especially males, lived more often with their parents. Cranial irradiation dose <or=25 Gy was an important independent prognostic factor of lower educational achievement. Survivors with a history of brain/CNS tumours had a higher risk of being single than survivors with a diagnosis of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These results indicate that important aspects of life are affected in a substantial number of persons who have been diagnosed with cancer during childhood or adolescence.","['Langeveld, N E', 'Ubbink, M C', 'Last, B F', 'Grootenhuis, M A', 'Voute, P A', 'De Haan, R J']","['Langeveld NE', 'Ubbink MC', 'Last BF', 'Grootenhuis MA', 'Voute PA', 'De Haan RJ']","['Department of Paediatric Oncology, Emma Kinderziekenhuis, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Psychooncology,Psycho-oncology,9214524,IM,"['Achievement', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Employment', 'Family Characteristics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasms/*rehabilitation', 'Netherlands', 'Survivors/*psychology']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pon.628 [doi]'],ppublish,Psychooncology. 2003 Apr-May;12(3):213-25. doi: 10.1002/pon.628.,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified 28 distinct genomic ATM alterations in 14 patients (25%). Ten of them were scored as probably biologically significant and appear to be associated with a high risk of relapse (P<0.01). Six alterations of potential biological significance were observed in 5 cases of B-precursor ALL (19%), while 5 were found in 3 cases of T-ALL (10%). In two cases of B-precursor ALL, the ATM alterations were found in the germline, indicating an ATM carrier status. We report here the high prevalence of genomic ATM alterations in childhood ALL.

METHODS: Serial echocardiograms were performed on 101 acute lymphoblastic leukemia survivors and 83 Wilms tumor survivors after a mean interval of 6.2 years and 6.7 years since last anthracycline dose, respectively, at first study, and after 10.3 years and 11.1 years, respectively, at second study. The paired data were contrasted with data from 100 normal subjects, and potential correlations with follow-up interval, cumulative dose, cancer diagnosis, gender, age at diagnosis, and growth were explored using univariate and multiple regression techniques. RESULTS: The most important predictor of worsening cardiac performance was total anthracycline dose. As a group, patients receiving < 240 mg/m(2) showed no deterioration of left ventricular end systolic stress at > 10 years from the end of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors who have received low-dose anthracycline require cardiac surveillance infrequently.

VEGF is a soluble, circulating, angiogenic molecule that acts through receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). SU5416 is a small-molecule RTK inhibitor (RTKI) that targets VEGFR-2, c-kit, and fms-related tyrosine kinase Flk2. METHODS: Adult patients with advanced CMML, AMM, CML-BP, or other BCR-ABL negative MPD were entered on a multicenter, Phase II study. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (19 patients with BCR-ABL negative MPD, 6 patients with CMML, 4 patients with CML-BP, and 3 patients with AMM) with a median age of 66 years (range, 29-85 years) received SU5416 145 mg/m(2) twice weekly intravenously for a median of three 4-week cycles (maximum, 12 cycles). Drug-related Grade 3-4 toxicities included acute abdominal pain (13%), bone pain (9%), infusion-related dyspnea (9%) or headache (6%), fatigue (6%), diarrhea (3%), and catheter site reactions (3%). Eleven patients (34%) did not receive a second cycle of therapy (6 patients had progressive disease, 3 because of adverse events; 2 patients withdrew due to lack of response). One patient with AMM achieved a partial response. Eight patients received more than 6 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS: SU5416 had minimal clinical activity in patients with MPD.

In a previous study, the authors showed that CD38 expression was correlated with a poor prognosis in patients with B-CLL. In the current study, blood samples from patients with B-CLL were examined to identify CD31 surface marker expression, and CD31 expression was correlated with several other known prognostic variables, including CD38. METHODS: Using flow cytometry, peripheral blood samples from 120 patients with B-CLL were analyzed for CD31 and CD38 expression on CD19 positive leukemic B cells. RESULTS: Thirteen of 120 patients (11%) had CD31 expression on < 20% of their B cells, and the remaining patients had various levels of CD31 expression. The median expression of CD31 was 76% of leukemic, CD19 positive cells. Levels of CD31 expression were not correlated with survival outcomes or with any of the known prognostic parameters when all patients were considered. Patients who had high CD38 expression (>or= 20%), as expected, had significantly shorter survival (P = 0.001) compared with patients who had low CD38 expression (< 20%). However, in patients with low CD38 expression, a subgroup with low CD31 expression (< 76%) had significantly longer survival compared with the survival for the entire group (P = 0.0001). Moreover, the survival pattern of patients with low CD38 expression and high CD31 expression was not significantly different from the survival pattern seen in patients with high CD38 expression. CONCLUSIONS: CD31 expression further defined a subgroup of patients with B-CLL who had a different survival outcome.

We used a German population-based case-control study with self-reported information on allergies of the children and their first-degree relatives. Our study included a total of 1,130 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 164 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 2,957 controls. A major finding of our study is that hay fever, neurodermatitis and contact eczema are underrepresented within the group of children with ALL, with respective odds ratios (OR) of 0.45 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.66) for hay fever, of 0.49 (CI 0.34-0.71) for neurodermatitis and of 0.62 (CI 0.39-0.99) for eczema, respectively. Atopic diseases, comprising hay fever, neurodermatitis and asthma, are much stronger related with a reduced risk of ALL than other allergies (OR 0.52, CI 0.40-0.67 vs. OR 0.89, CI 0.66-1.21). The strongest association is seen with an atopy in the index child; however, ALL risk is also reduced if one of the parents or a sibling had an atopic disease. No such consistent pattern is seen for AML. Our data suggest that atopy or a family history of atopy are associated with a reduced risk of childhood ALL. Recall bias remains a concern, but sensitivity analysis provided some evidence that the protective effect is unlikely to be attributable to this bias in its entirety.","['Schuz, Joachim', 'Morgan, Gareth', 'Bohler, Eva', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Michaelis, Jorg']","['Schuz J', 'Morgan G', 'Bohler E', 'Kaatsch P', 'Michaelis J']","['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University of Mainz, Mainz, Germany. schuez@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Asthma/complications/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eczema/complications/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Immediate/*complications/epidemiology', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neurodermatitis/complications/epidemiology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal/complications/epidemiology', 'Risk Factors', 'Social Class']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11054 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jun 10;105(2):255-60. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11054.,,,,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even bone marrow transplantation from siblings or matched unrelated donors offer minimal chances for cure, suggesting that these cases are not only refractory to chemotherapy but also resist the graft-vs.-leukemia effect. We herein describe the first permanent, factor-independent c-kit(hi+) cell line CS-1 derived from an unrelated donor stem cell transplanted patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-M5a of high-risk karyotype [monosomy 7, t(2;11)(q31;p13), t(10;12)(q24;q24)]. Having the same karyotype, CS-1 exhibits an autonomous growth pattern and responds to stem cell factor (SCF). CS-1 did not induce T cell activation in mixed-lymphocyte-tumor-cultures (MLTCs) and, when used as third party stimulators, decreased T cell proliferation in mixed-lymphocyte reactions (MLRs). Cytokines added exogenously or secreted from bystander T cells caused CS-1 to differentiate into dendritic cells (DCs). CS-1-derived DCs, in contrast to DCs originating from non-malignant CD34(+) progenitor cells, had virtually no T cell stimulatory effect, indicating that CS-1 is both immunosuppressive and poorly immunogenic. These properties may partially be due to the detected downregulation of costimulatory molecules and appear to involve a soluble factor. CS-1 cells injected subcutaneously (s.c.) to non-obese diabetes/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice produced solid tumors, disseminating into bone marrow and spleen. The data show that transforming AML blasts with high-risk karyotype into DCs is insufficient to restore their immunogenicity and that the CS-1 cell line is useful to identify tumor-related immunosuppressive mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.","['Erben, Ulrike', 'Thiel, Eckhard', 'Bittroff-Leben, Alexandra', 'Schoch, Claudia', 'Fichtner, Iduna', 'Durkop, Horst', 'Notter, Michael']","['Erben U', 'Thiel E', 'Bittroff-Leben A', 'Schoch C', 'Fichtner I', 'Durkop H', 'Notter M']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, University Hospital Benjamin Franklin, Free University, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Cytokines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/05/20 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.11053 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2003 Jun 10;105(2):232-40. doi: 10.1002/ijc.11053.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These genes are expressed early during embryogenesis and initiate a cascade of gene expression responsible for specific cell lineage commitment. Thus, identification of their products may allow the classification of seemingly primitive, morphologically uncommitted tumors such as small blue round cell tumors. The transcription factor Sox9 has been demonstrated to be a master regulator of the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes. For this reason, we examined the utility of Sox9 in distinguishing mesenchymal chondrosarcoma (a small cell malignancy thought to be derived from primitive chondroprogenitor cells) from other primitive small cell malignancies. Representative sections from 90 cases of small blue round cell tumors (22 mesenchymal chodrosarcoma, 10 neuroblastomas, 11 rhabdomyosarcomas, 9 Ewing's sarcomas/primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 5 desmoplastic small round cell tumors, 7 small cell carcinomas, 6 Merkel cell carcinomas, 6 small cell osteosarcomas, 7 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, 7 lymphoblastic leukemias/lymphomas, and 5 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcomas) were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies to Sox9 protein. All but 1 mesenchymal chondrosarcoma showed positive nuclear staining in both primitive mesenchymal and cartilaginous components of the tumor. All other types of small blue round cell tumors, as well as the lymphomas and leukemias, were negative for Sox9 protein. These findings confirm that mesenchymal chondrosarcoma has phenotypic features corresponding to the early condensational phase of cartilaginous differentiation. More important, Sox9 may serve as a useful tool in the differentiation of small cell malignancies.","['Wehrli, Bret Michael', 'Huang, Wendong', 'De Crombrugghe, Benoit', 'Ayala, Alberto G', 'Czerniak, Bogdan']","['Wehrli BM', 'Huang W', 'De Crombrugghe B', 'Ayala AG', 'Czerniak B']","['Department of Pathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Box 085, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Carcinoma, Merkel Cell/chemistry', 'Cartilage/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Child', 'Chondrosarcoma, Mesenchymal/chemistry/classification/*diagnosis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/*analysis/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Male', 'Mesoderm/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neuroblastoma/chemistry', 'Osteosarcoma/chemistry', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/chemistry', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/chemistry', 'SOX9 Transcription Factor', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/chemistry', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis/immunology']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/hupa.2003.41 [doi]', 'S0046817702297415 [pii]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 2003 Mar;34(3):263-9. doi: 10.1053/hupa.2003.41.,,"['0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (SOX9 Transcription Factor)', '0 (SOX9 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

French-American-British (FAB) group and National Cancer Institute (NCI) workshop definitions and criteria developed for classification of AML in humans were adapted. Major modifications entailed revision of definitions of blast cells as applied to the dog and cat, broadening the scope of leukemia classification, and making provisions for differentiating erythremic myelosis and undifferentiated MPD. A consensus cytomorphologic diagnosis was reached in 39 (79.6%) cases comprising 26 of AML, 10 of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and 3 of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Diagnostic concordance for these diseases varied from 60 to 81% (mean 73.3 +/- 7.1%) and interobserver agreement ranged from 51.3 to 84.6% (mean 73.1 +/- 9.3%). Various subtypes of AML identified included Ml, M2, M4, M5a, M5b, and M6. Acute undifferentiated leukemia (AUL) was recognized as a specific entity. M3 was not encountered, but this subclass was retained as a diagnostic possibility. The designations M6Er and MDS-Er were introduced where the suffix ""Er"" indicated preponderance of erythroid component. Chief hematologic abnormalities included circulating blast cells in 98% of the cases, with 36.7% cases having >30% blast cells, and thrombocytopenia and anemia in approximately 86 to 88% of the cases. Bone marrow examination revealed panmyeloid dysplastic changes, particularly variable numbers of megaloblastoid rubriblasts and rubricytes in all AML subtypes and increased numbers of eosinophils in MDS. Cytochemical patterns of neutrophilic markers were evident in most cases of Ml and M2, while monocytic markers were primarily seen in M5a and M5b cases. It is proposed that well-prepared, Romanowsky-stained blood and bone marrow smears should be examined to determine blast cell types and percentages for cytomorphologic diagnosis of AML. Carefully selected areas of stained films presenting adequate cellular details should be used to count a minimum of 200 cells. In cases with borderline diagnosis, at least 500 cells should be counted. The identity of blast cells should be ascertained using appropriate cytochemical markers of neutrophilic, monocytic, and megakaryocytic differentiation. A blast cell count of > 30% in blood and/or bone marrow indicates AML or AUL, while a count of < 30% blasts in bone marrow suggests MDS, chronic myeloid leukemias, or even a leukemoid reaction. Myeloblasts, monoblasts, and megakaryoblasts comprise the blast cell count. The FAB approach with additional criteria should be used to distinguish AUL and various subtypes of AML (Ml to M7 and M6Er) and to differentiate MDS, MDS-ER, chronic myeloid leukemias, and leukemoid reaction. Bone marrow core biopsy and electron microscopy may be required to confirm the specific diagnosis. Immunophenotyping with lineage specific antibodies is in its infancy in veterinary medicine. Development of this technique is encouraged to establish an undisputed identity of blast cells. Validity of the proposed criteria needs to be substantiated in large prospective and retrospective studies. Similarly, clinical relevance of cytomorphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characterizations of AML in dogs and cats remains to be determined.","['Jain, Nemi C.', 'Blue, Julia T.', 'Grindem, Carol B.', 'Harvey, John W.', 'Kociba, Gary J.', 'Krehbiel, Janver D.', 'Latimer, Kenneth S.', 'Raskin, Rose E.', 'Thrall, Mary A.', 'Zinkl, Joseph G.']","['Jain NC', 'Blue JT', 'Grindem CB', 'Harvey JW', 'Kociba GJ', 'Krehbiel JD', 'Latimer KS', 'Raskin RE', 'Thrall MA', 'Zinkl JG']","['School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis, CA 95616.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Clin Pathol,Veterinary clinical pathology,9880575,,,,1991/01/01 00:00,2003/04/04 05:00,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1939-165x.1991.tb00571.x [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Clin Pathol. 1991;20(3):63-82. doi: 10.1111/j.1939-165x.1991.tb00571.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective was to assess incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of preventing/treating HU and TLS with recombinant urate oxidase, rasburicase (Fasturtec/Elitek). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Incidence and costs of HU and TLS were based on a multi-country chart review. Life expectancy at the time of diagnosis was based on published survival rates and age at diagnosis. Reductions of HU/TLS following treatment with rasburicase were based on clinical trial data. RESULTS: Prevention with rasburicase appears highly cost-effective in children (ICER between Eur 425 and Eur 3054 per life-year saved, LYS). In adults, prevention is more cost-effective in NHL and ALL (maximum ICER of Eur 41383 and Eur 32126 per LYS). Treatment of established HU/TLS with rasburicase is cost-saving in children and highly cost-effective in adults. The results are robust in children. In adults, the prevention strategy appears sensitive to the risk of HU/TLS. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, rasburicase, in addition to the demonstrated clinical benefit, is an economically attractive new option in the treatment of HU, both in adults and children. In prevention the drug has an attractive economic profile in children, and is cost-effective in adults with ALL and NHL.","['Annemans, L', 'Moeremans, K', 'Lamotte, M', 'Garcia Conde, J', 'van den Berg, H', 'Myint, H', 'Pieters, R', 'Uyttebroeck, A']","['Annemans L', 'Moeremans K', 'Lamotte M', 'Garcia Conde J', 'van den Berg H', 'Myint H', 'Pieters R', 'Uyttebroeck A']","['HEDM (Health Economics and Disease Management), Brusselsesteenweg 91, 1860, Meise, Belgium. lieven.annemans@hedm.be']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Drug Costs/statistics & numerical data', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*drug therapy/economics/epidemiology', 'Urate Oxidase/*economics/*therapeutic use']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00520-002-0435-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2003 Apr;11(4):249-57. doi: 10.1007/s00520-002-0435-3.

To evaluate the efficacy of itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) in the prophylaxis of fungal infections in neutropenic patients, we conducted a prospective trial. A total of 61 patients with acute leukemia (113 cytotoxic chemotherapy episodes) were enrolled in the study. One patient in the itraconazole group was excluded because itraconazole was not taken due to gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Because the duration of neutropenia (neutrophil count, <0.5 x 10(9)/l) did not reach 7 days, 3 (1 patient) and 13 (4 patients) cytotoxic chemotherapy episodes in the itraconazole and control groups, respectively, were excluded. After these exclusions, the study population consisted of 31 patients (54 cytotoxic chemotherapy episodes) who had taken itraconazole and 24 patients (43 cytotoxic chemotherapy episodes) who had not taken itraconazole. Prophylactic treatment was initiated on the first day of chemotherapy and was continued until the end of the neutropenic period (absolute neutrophil count, >1 x 10(9)/l) unless a systemic fungal infection was documented or suspected. Thirteen episodes (24%) in the itraconazole group and 7 episodes (16%) in the control group proceeded to intravenous amphotericin B (P > 0.05).

In this study we investigated oxidative DNA damage in relation to the labile iron pool in a pair of mouse lymphoma L5178Y (LY) sublines (LY-R and LY-S) differing in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide. The LY-R cells, which are hydrogen peroxide-sensitive, contain 3 times more labile iron than the hydrogen peroxide-resistant LY-S cells. Using the comet assay, we compared total DNA breakage in the studied cell lines treated with hydrogen peroxide (25 microM for 30 min at 4 degrees C). More DNA damage was found in LY-R cells than in LY-S cells. We also compared the levels of DNA lesions sensitive to specific DNA repair enzymes in both cell lines treated with H(2)O(2). The levels of endonuclease III-sensitive sites and Fapy-DNA glycosylase-sensitive sites were found to be higher in LY-R cells than in LY-S cells. Our data suggest that the sensitivity of LY-R cells to H(2)O(2) is partially caused by the higher yield of oxidative DNA damage, as compared to that in LY-S cells. The critical factor appears to be the availability of transition metal ions that take part in the OH radical-generating Fenton reaction (very likely in the form of LIP).","['Kruszewski, Marcin', 'Iwanenko, Teresa']","['Kruszewski M', 'Iwanenko T']","['Department of Experimental Hematology and Cord Blood Bank, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Warszawa, Poland. marcinkr@orange.ichtj.waw.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*toxicity', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2002/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2002/12/03 00:00 [revised]', '2003/01/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['035001211 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2003;50(1):211-5. doi: 035001211.,,"['BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This subject seems to be worth studying, because hyperthermia can assist cancer therapy. A 1-h incubation at 37 degrees C of normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and human myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 with 0.5 microM doxorubicin gave significant level of DNA damage as assessed by the alkaline comet assay. The cells were then incubated in doxorubicin-free repair medium at 37 degrees C or 41 degrees C. The lymphocytes incubated at 37 degrees C needed about 60 min to remove completely the damage to their DNA, whereas at 41 degrees C the time required for complete repair was shortened to 30 min. There was also a difference between the repair kinetics at 37 degrees C and 41 degrees C in cancer cells. Moreover, the kinetics were different in doxorubicin-sensitive and resistant cells. Therefore, hyperthermia may significantly affect the kinetics of DNA repair in drug-treated cells, but the magnitude of the effect may be different in normal and cancer cells. These features may be exploited in cancer chemotherapy to increase the effectiveness of the treatment and reduce unwanted effects of anticancer drugs in normal cells and fight DNA repair-based drug resistance of cancer cells.","['Blasiak, Janusz', 'Widera, Kinga', 'Pertynski, Tomasz']","['Blasiak J', 'Widera K', 'Pertynski T']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. januszb@biol.uni.lodz.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Acta Biochim Pol,Acta biochimica Polonica,14520300R,IM,"['DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects/*physiology', 'Doxorubicin/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Hyperthermia, Induced/*adverse effects', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*physiology/radiation effects']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2002/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2003/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['035001191 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Biochim Pol. 2003;50(1):191-5. doi: 035001191.,,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E1A has also been shown to downregulate c-erb-B-2/neu expression, resulting in inhibition of growth in c-erb-B-2/neu overexpressing tumour cells. In this study, we have investigated the effect of E1A expression on four head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines that do not overexpress c-erb-B-2/neu. Cell cycle and Western blot analysis show E1A-mediated induction of apoptosis in all cell lines examined. This induction of apoptosis was independent of the p53 status as it occurred in the cell lines with wild-type, mutated or deleted p53. However, there was no evidence of E1A-induced apoptosis in a p53(+ve) normal human fibroblast cell line, 1BR3. Analysis of apoptosis in the SCC cell lines demonstrated E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR, which was overexpressed in each of these cell lines. Overexpression of an exogenously introduced EGFR, under the control of an E1A-insensitive heterologous promoter, blocked E1A induction of apoptosis in these cells. Therefore, E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR expression appears to be the cause, rather than a consequence of E1A-induced apoptosis in these SCC cell lines. Previous studies have shown downregulation of EGFR expression by PML. Interestingly, E1A expression in the HNSCC cells altered the pattern of PML distribution and induced the level of PML protein, thus suggesting that E1A-mediated downregulation of EGFR may occur via direct or indirect interactions with PML. These findings demonstrate a novel pathway by which E1A can induce apoptosis and identify EGFR as a potential target for the development of therapeutic strategies against epithelial malignancies, the majority of which have abnormal EGFR expression.","['Flinterman, Marcella', 'Gaken, Joop', 'Farzaneh, Farzin', 'Tavassoli, Mahvash']","['Flinterman M', 'Gaken J', 'Farzaneh F', 'Tavassoli M']","[""Department of Oral Medicine and Pathology, King's College London, The Rayne Institute, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Adenovirus E1A Proteins/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division', 'Down-Regulation', 'ErbB Receptors/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Head and Neck Neoplasms/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/physiology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206190 [doi]', '1206190 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Apr 3;22(13):1965-77. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206190.,,"['0 (Adenovirus E1A Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to ascertain the relationship between the degree of 99mTc-MIBI uptake and the level of Pgp expression in patients with newly diagnosed leukaemia. A total of 26 patients (12 female and 14 male; mean age 46.8+/-3.7 years) with newly diagnosed leukaemia were included in the study. None of the patients had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Images were obtained 20 min post-injection of 740 MBq 99mTc-MIBI. Whole-body and planar spot images of the pelvis and thorax were acquired. The uptake of the MIBI in the bone marrow was evaluated using a qualitative and also a quantitative scoring system with determination of the tumour-to-background (T/B) ratios. Flow cytometry was performed for determining the Pgp expression of the blast cells in the bone marrow aspiration samples. There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between the Pgp level in numeric values and both mean qualitative (P<0.001; r=-0.665) and quantitative (P=0.001; r=-0.606) results of 99mTc-MIBI imaging. Both the mean qualitative score and the T/B ratios were higher in patients who were Pgp negative than in those who were Pgp positive (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). These data indicate that an increased level of Pgp expression is correlated with a low accumulation of 99mTc-MIBI in bone marrow of patients with leukaemia. 99mTc-MIBI bone marrow imaging, as a method of functional imaging, can give in vivo information concerning the functional expression of the MDR phenotype in patients with untreated leukaemia.","['Ak, I', 'Aslan, V', 'Vardareli, E', 'Gulbas, Z']","['Ak I', 'Aslan V', 'Vardareli E', 'Gulbas Z']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, Turkey. ilknur_ak@yahoo.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Nucl Med Commun,Nuclear medicine communications,8201017,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnostic imaging/metabolism', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/pharmacokinetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi/*pharmacokinetics', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Whole-Body Counting/methods']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2004/02/14 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/02/14 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00006231-200304000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucl Med Commun. 2003 Apr;24(4):397-402. doi: 10.1097/00006231-200304000-00009.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '971Z4W1S09 (Technetium Tc 99m Sestamibi)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, about 30% of myeloid progenitors (CFU-GM) from CML BM still formed colonies in the presence of IM, most of which had BCR-ABL RNA. About half of these treated colonies also displayed methylation of the internal ABL Pa promoter, a CML-specific epigenetic alteration, which was used in this study as a marker for BCR-ABL translocation-containing cells.

The FeLV, Rickard strain, subgroup A (FRA) genome contained at the 3' end of the envgene, an insert of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) linked to cDNA sequence of either herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) or a truncated HSV-TK (HSV-ATK) or yeast cytosine deaminase (CD). These constructs were transfected into feline fibroblast cells (H927). The viruses produced were determined to be replication-competent. The stable propagation of the full-length transgene was, however, dependent on the size of the insert, IRES-CD being the smallest in size (1031 bp) exhibiting maximal stability for at least up to six months. The protein products of the transgenes could be detected, despite the appearance of deleted proviruses at late passages. The transduced cells were susceptible to cytotoxic killing when the appropriate prodrug, ganciclovir (GCV), acyclovir (ACV) or 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) was added to the culture medium. H927 cells, infected with another subgroup of FeLV, namely, FeLV-B or FeLV-C, could be superinfected by the FRA-suicide gene viruses and thus, subjected to killing. Interestingly, at an early stage of infection by the parental FRA, H927 cells could also be reinfected by the same subgroup FRA constructs to induce the suicide effect. Among the three constructs, the vector with the CD gene was determined to be superior to others in terms of stability, therapeutic index and bystander effect in the cell culture test system.

Comparison of the gene expression patterns of an EBV-negative clone of the originally EBV-positive BL line Akata, with its Neo(R)-EBV derivative, revealed a significant difference in the expression of the T cell leukemia 1 oncogene (TCL-1). Subsequent expression studies showed that the original EBV-positive Akata line and the EBV-reconstituted derivative expressed high levels of TCL-1, whereas the EBV-negative variant showed only a low level of expression. Two other independently established EBV-positive BLs (Mutu and OMA) that have also thrown off EBV showed a similar decrease in TCL-1 expression after virus loss. Reinfection with Neo(R)-EBV restored the TCL-1 expression levels in the EBV loss variants to as high a level as the originally EBV-positive lines. High-resolution immunostaining showed that TCL-1 was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Our findings suggest that high expression of TCL-1 is necessary for the development of the BL phenotype. In view of the fact that germinal center B cells, regarded as the progenitors of BL, do not express TCL-1, we suggest that constitutive expression of this oncogene occurs by genetic or epigenetic changes in the EBV-negative BLs. In the originally EBV-positive BLs, the ability of the virus to switch on TCL-1 expression would obviate this need.","['Kiss, Csaba', 'Nishikawa, Jun', 'Takada, Kenzo', 'Trivedi, Pankaj', 'Klein, George', 'Szekely, Laszlo']","['Kiss C', 'Nishikawa J', 'Takada K', 'Trivedi P', 'Klein G', 'Szekely L']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, S-171 77 Stockholm, Sweden. csaba.kiss@mtc.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism/*virology', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/isolation & purification/*pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', '*Oncogenes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/06/18 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.0730710100 [doi]', '0730710100 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2003 Apr 15;100(8):4813-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.0730710100.

Patients with SCN may evolve to have myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myelocytic leukemia. In approximately 20% of SCN cases, a truncation mutation is found in the cytoplasmic region of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor (G-CSFR). We then generated mice carrying murine wild-type G-CSFR and its mutants equivalent to truncations at amino acids 718 and 731 in human G-CSFR, those were reported to be related to leukemic transformation of SCN. Although numbers of peripheral white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets did not differ among mutant and wild-type G-CSFR transgenic (Tg) mice, both of the mutant receptor Tg mice had one third of peripheral neutrophil cell counts compared with wild-type receptor Tg mice. The mutant receptor Tg mice also showed impaired resistance to the infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Moreover, bone marrow of these Tg mice had an increased percentage of immature myeloid cells, a feature of SCN. This maturation arrest was also observed in in vitro cultures of bone marrow cells of truncated G-CSFR Tg mice under G-CSF stimulation. In addition, clonal culture of bone marrow cells of the truncated G-CSFR Tg mice showed the hypersensitivity to G-CSF in myeloid progenitors.

Although histone acetylation and methylation (Lys 4) are high before and after MEL differentiation, recruitment of the erythroid-specific activator NF-E2 to the promoter and preinitiation complex (PIC) assembly occur only after differentiation. We reported previously that targeted deletion of the LCR reduces beta-globin gene expression to 1%-4% of WT without affecting promoter histone acetylation. Here, we report that NF-E2 is recruited equally efficiently to the adult beta-globin promoters of the DeltaLCR and WT alleles. Moreover, the LCR deletion reduces PIC assembly only twofold, but has a dramatic effect on Ser 5 phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and transcriptional elongation. Our results suggest at least three distinct stages in beta-globin gene activation: (1) an LCR-independent chromatin opening stage prior to NF-E2 recruitment to the promoter and PIC assembly; (2) an intermediate stage in which NF-E2 binding (LCR-independent) and PIC assembly (partially LCR-dependent) occur; and (3) an LCR-dependent fully active stage characterized by efficient pol II elongation. Thus, in its native location the LCR functions primarily downstream of activator recruitment and PIC assembly.","['Sawado, Tomoyuki', 'Halow, Jessica', 'Bender, M A', 'Groudine, Mark']","['Sawado T', 'Halow J', 'Bender MA', 'Groudine M']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Histones/chemistry/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Locus Control Region/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Initiation Site', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/05/16 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1101/gad.1072303 [doi]', 'U-10723R [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2003 Apr 15;17(8):1009-18. doi: 10.1101/gad.1072303.

Folate deficiency has been associated with uracil misincorporation into DNA and DNA double strand breaks during uracil excision repair, thus increasing the risk of chromosomal aberrations. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) directs 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate toward methionine synthesis at the expense of DNA synthesis. Two MTHFR polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C, have been associated with reduced enzyme activity and C677T with altered distribution of intracellular folate metabolites. Rapidly replicating cell types, such as hematopoietic cells, may be especially sensitive to changes in the availability of intracellular folate. Three case-control studies have evaluated the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risk of acute leukemia, and they suggest that both adults and children with the variant forms of MTHFR have a decreased risk of lymphoid leukemias. However, no modification in risk has been observed for myeloid leukemias, suggesting that differences in folate requirements or susceptibility to chromosomal damage may exist between myeloid and lymphoid cells. Further investigation into the association between MTHFR polymorphisms and the risk of leukemia is warranted. It should include larger sample sizes and other polymorphisms in folate metabolism and address interactions with folate status.","['Robien, Kim', 'Ulrich, Cornelia M']","['Robien K', 'Ulrich CM']","['Cancer Prevention Research Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/*metabolism', '*Genetics, Population', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/genetics/metabolism/physiology', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Risk Factors']",124,2003/04/04 05:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/04/04 05:00'],"['2003/04/04 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/04 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/aje/kwg024 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 2003 Apr 1;157(7):571-82. doi: 10.1093/aje/kwg024.,['T32 CA80416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)', 'EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Denmark, poliovirus vaccine was administered to most children from 1955 through 1961. SV40 DNA sequences have been detected in several human malignancies, including mesothelioma, ependymoma, choroid plexus tumors, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. To clarify whether SV40 infection increases risk of these cancers or of cancers arising in children, we examined cancer incidence in three Danish birth cohorts. METHODS: Population-based cancer incidence data from 1943 through 1997 were obtained from the Danish Cancer Registry. The relationship between exposure to SV40-contaminated vaccine and cancer incidence was evaluated by examining incidence in birth cohorts that differed in exposure to SV40-contaminated vaccine. In addition, cancer incidence was examined in children who were 0-4 years of age before, during, and after the period of vaccine contamination. Incidence was compared using Poisson regression, adjusting for age differences. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: After 69.5 million person-years of follow-up, individuals exposed to SV40-contaminated poliovirus vaccine as infants (i.e., born 1955-1961) or children (i.e., born 1946-1952) had lower overall cancer risk (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81 to 0.91 and RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.75 to 0.84, respectively; P<.001 for both) than unexposed individuals (i.e., born 1964-1970, after the vaccine was cleared of SV40 contamination). Specifically, SV40 exposure was not associated with increased incidence of mesothelioma, ependymoma, choroid plexus tumor, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. After 19.5 million person-years of follow-up, incidence of all cancers combined, of intracranial tumors, and of leukemia among children aged 0-4 years was also not associated with SV40 exposure. Ependymoma incidence was higher during the exposed period than during the unexposed period (RR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.36 to 4.92; P =.004 versus the period before contamination); however, incidence peaked in 1969, after the vaccine was cleared of SV40. CONCLUSION: Exposure to SV40-contaminated poliovirus vaccine in Denmark was not associated with increased cancer incidence.","['Engels, Eric A', 'Katki, Hormuzd A', 'Nielsen, Nete M', 'Winther, Jeanette F', 'Hjalgrim, Henrik', 'Gjerris, Flemming', 'Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Frisch, Morten']","['Engels EA', 'Katki HA', 'Nielsen NM', 'Winther JF', 'Hjalgrim H', 'Gjerris F', 'Rosenberg PS', 'Frisch M']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD 20892, USA. engelse@exchange.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Drug Contamination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Poliovirus Vaccines/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Registries', 'Risk', '*Simian virus 40']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/95.7.532 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Apr 2;95(7):532-9. doi: 10.1093/jnci/95.7.532.,,['0 (Poliovirus Vaccines)'],,,,,,,"['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2003 Aug 20;95(16):1249; author reply 1250.

Often these classification problems are linked, and one wants to find ""marker genes"" that are differentially expressed in particular sets of ""conditions."" We have developed a method that simultaneously clusters genes and conditions, finding distinctive ""checkerboard"" patterns in matrices of gene expression data, if they exist. In a cancer context, these checkerboards correspond to genes that are markedly up- or downregulated in patients with particular types of tumors. Our method, spectral biclustering, is based on the observation that checkerboard structures in matrices of expression data can be found in eigenvectors corresponding to characteristic expression patterns across genes or conditions. In addition, these eigenvectors can be readily identified by commonly used linear algebra approaches, in particular the singular value decomposition (SVD), coupled with closely integrated normalization steps. We present a number of variants of the approach, depending on whether the normalization over genes and conditions is done independently or in a coupled fashion. We then apply spectral biclustering to a selection of publicly available cancer expression data sets, and examine the degree to which the approach is able to identify checkerboard structures. Furthermore, we compare the performance of our biclustering methods against a number of reasonable benchmarks (e.g., direct application of SVD or normalized cuts to raw data).","['Kluger, Yuval', 'Basri, Ronen', 'Chang, Joseph T', 'Gerstein, Mark']","['Kluger Y', 'Basri R', 'Chang JT', 'Gerstein M']","['Department of Genetics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genome Res,Genome research,9518021,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cerebellar Neoplasms/genetics', 'Databases, Genetic/*classification/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Genes, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Glioma/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Medulloblastoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Phenotype', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1101/gr.648603 [doi]', '13/4/703 [pii]']",ppublish,Genome Res. 2003 Apr;13(4):703-16. doi: 10.1101/gr.648603.,"['P50 HG002357/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 HG02357-01/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC430175,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipid rafts play a structural role in signal initiation by the high affinity receptor for IgE. Cross-linking of IgE-receptor complexes by antigen causes their coalescence with lipid rafts, where they are phosphorylated by the Src family tyrosine kinase, Lyn. To understand how lipid rafts participate in functional coupling between Lyn and FcepsilonRI, we investigated whether the lipid raft environment influences the specific activity of Lyn. We used differential detergent solubility and sucrose gradient fractionation to isolate Lyn from raft and nonraft regions of the plasma membrane in the presence or absence of tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors. We show that Lyn recovered from lipid rafts has a substantially higher specific activity than Lyn from nonraft environments. Furthermore, this higher specific activity correlates with increased tyrosine phosphorylation at the active site loop of the kinase domain. Based on these results, we propose that lipid rafts exclude a phosphatase that negatively regulates Lyn kinase activity by constitutive dephosphorylation of the kinase domain tyrosine residue of Lyn. In this model, cross-linking of FcepsilonRI promotes its proximity to active Lyn in a lipid raft environment.","['Young, Ryan M', 'Holowka, David', 'Baird, Barbara']","['Young RM', 'Holowka D', 'Baird B']","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Detergents', 'Enzyme Activation/physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Membrane Microdomains/*enzymology', 'Octoxynol', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/*metabolism']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211402200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)73374-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 6;278(23):20746-52. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211402200.

The HTLV-I transactivator protein Tax plays an integral role in the etiology of adult T cell leukemia, as expression of Tax in T lymphocytes has been shown to result in immortalization. In addition, Tax is known to interface with numerous transcription factor families, including activating transcription factor/cAMP response element-binding protein and nuclear factor-kappaB, requiring Tax to localize to both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In this report, the nucleocytoplasmic localization of Tax was examined in Jurkat, HeLa, and U-87 MG cells. The results reported herein indicate that Tax contains a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) that, when fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP), can direct nuclear export via the CRM-1 pathway, as determined by leptomycin B inhibition of nuclear export. However, cytoplasmic localization of full-length Tax was not altered by treatment with leptomycin B, suggesting that native Tax utilizes another nuclear export pathway. Additional support for the presence of a functional NES has also been shown because the NES mutant Tax(L200A)-GFP localized to the nuclear membrane in the majority of U-87 MG cells. Evidence has also been provided suggesting that the Tax NES likely exists as a conditionally masked signal because the truncation mutant TaxDelta214-GFP localized constitutively to the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Tax localization may be directed by specific changes in Tax conformation or by specific interactions with cellular proteins leading to changes in the availability of the Tax NES and nuclear localization signal.","['Alefantis, Timothy', 'Barmak, Kate', 'Harhaj, Edward W', 'Grant, Christian', 'Wigdahl, Brian']","['Alefantis T', 'Barmak K', 'Harhaj EW', 'Grant C', 'Wigdahl B']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Medicine, Pennsylvania State University Hershey, 500 University Drive, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Active Transport, Cell Nucleus', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/pharmacology', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211576200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)68588-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 13;278(24):21814-22. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211576200.

These proteins control key developmental processes in which they function as both transcriptional activators and repressors. How these opposing regulatory modes can be accomplished in the in vivo context of a cell has not been clear. In this study we use the developing cone cell in the Drosophila visual system to elucidate the mechanism of positive and negative regulation by the Runx protein Lozenge (Lz). We describe a regulatory circuit in which Lz causes transcriptional activation of the homeodomain protein Cut, which can then stabilize a Lz repressor complex in the same cell. Whether a gene is activated or repressed is determined by whether the Lz activator or the repressor complex binds to its upstream sequence. This study provides a mechanistic basis for the dual function of Runx proteins that is likely to be conserved in mammalian systems.","['Canon, Jude', 'Banerjee, Utpal']","['Canon J', 'Banerjee U']","['Department of Biological Chemistry and Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, Molecular Biology Institute, University of California-Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Genetically Modified', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics', 'Drosophila melanogaster/*genetics/growth & development', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Homeodomain Proteins', 'Insect Hormones/genetics', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/05/08 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1101/gad.1064803 [doi]', '17/7/838 [pii]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2003 Apr 1;17(7):838-43. doi: 10.1101/gad.1064803.,"['R01 EY008152/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'EY 08152/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Insect Hormones)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ct protein, Drosophila)', '0 (lz protein, Drosophila)']",,PMC196027,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various types of therapy have been evaluated since this initial description and several are currently important only for historical comparison. Hairy-cell leukaemia serves as an example of rapid progress in the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Splenectomy was the first effective treatment because it resulted in an improvement in cytopenias and relief from symptomatic splenomegaly. However, complete remission of the disease was observed only very rarely. Splenectomy was considered an appropriate initial therapy from the 1950s to the early 1980s, although no randomized controlled studies have ever shown improved survival with this approach. In the early 1980s, more effective treatments were identified, initially interferon-alpha, then the purine analogues 2-deoxycoformycin and 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CdA). These types of therapy have been so effective that most previous treatments are now obsolete. Although the purine analogues result in sustained remissions in the majority of patients, a relatively small percentage of patients relapse and require other types of therapy. Splenectomy may be necessary in some instances.

The histology of bone marrow and spleen shows a pattern of infiltration similar to that in HCL. There is no recurrent chromosomal abnormality but complex karyotypes and monoallelic p53 deletion by fluorescence in situ hybridization are common. Patients are resistant to alkylating agents and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and only half achieve partial responses to pentostatin and/or cladribine. Splenectomy results in long-lasting partial responses in over two-thirds of the patients and is a good palliative treatment. Despite the lack of response to most therapies, the clinical course of HCL-variant is chronic. The median survival is 9 years and 42% of patients die of unrelated causes. Transformation to large cell is seen in 6% of patients. The inferior survival in HCL-variant compared with typical HCL cases may reflect the chemotherapy resistance.","['Matutes, E', 'Wotherspoon, A', 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Wotherspoon A', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK. estella@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

This involvement leads to splenomegaly with secondary consumption of red cells, platelets and neutrophils as well as other complications of an enlarged spleen, including infarction-or-rarely rupture. The common haematological complications of anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia are due not only to the enlarged spleen but probably also to hairy cells in the bone marrow inducing cytokine-mediated suppression of haematopoiesis. Hepatic involvement, although frequent, only occasionally leads to liver dysfunction. Infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hairy-cell leukaemia, presumably owing to neutropenia and monocytopenia in these patients. The infections seen may be due to unusual pathogens, including Mycobacterium and Listeria. Autoimmune disease, including polyarthitis and vasculitis, occurs frequently and does not correlate with the severity of the disease. Other rare complications include bone involvement, meningitis and ascites. A wide range of secondary malignancies have been reported in patients with hairy-cell leukaemia, but it is still unclear whether the incidence is increased and whether they are related to the disease or treatment.","['Kraut, Eric H']",['Kraut EH'],"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, 320 W 10th Avenue, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Best Pract Res Clin Haematol,Best practice & research.

Although there is a commonly held belief that HCL is associated with a significant increase in second neoplasms, several recent studies have not supported this notion. The development of extremely effective therapy for HCL results in a high incidence of complete remission.

Also, signalling and cytokine production are discussed in the context of malignant-cell activation. It is then demonstrated that many of the distinctive clinicopathological features of hairy-cell leukaemia can be explained in terms of the interaction of the activated malignant cells with other types of cell and tissue matrix.

Compared with the normal population, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) had low levels of solGMRalpha whereas clonal disorders of the myeloid lineage demonstrated higher levels of solGMRalpha. Patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) and high levels of solGMRalpha presented with a distinct clinical picture. These patients were older, predominantly belonged to the M4 and M5 French-American-British (FAB) subtypes, and they had higher white blood cell counts at presentation including myeloid precursors and myeloblasts. They often presented with either unexplained lung infiltrates or hypoxia and lower rates of microbiologically defined infections. Elevated solGMRalpha levels were not associated with decreased relapse-free and overall survival in the AML population. On multivariate analysis, the correlation between elevated solGMRalpha levels and age, M4 and M5 FAB subtypes and decreased numbers of infections persisted.

Ten patients had a significantly reduced expression of G-CSFR. Late stages of disease showed a higher proportion of either high or low G-CSFR expression than earlier stages. In MDS refractory anaemia (RA), G-CSFR was inversely related to CD33 expression. Most patients (9/10) with low G-CSFR expression had neutropenia of the peripheral blood. Neutropenia was less common in the normal group, but also occurred in the high expression group. No neutrophil response was observed following G-CSF administration to MDS-AML patients (6/6) with low G-CSFR expression. In the high expression group, patients (3/3) showed a response to G-CSF while, in the normal group (1/2), the response was minor. In the normal- or high-receptor-expressing groups, the receptors were functionally active in terms of apoptosis but not proliferation and clonogenic growth, although no clear correlation to receptor expression was observed. The G-CSFR signal transduction pathway in the normal and high group was not deficient of messenger RNA for either janus kinases (Jaks) or signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats).

We report the analysis of paraffin sections from 36 B-cell lymphoma biopsies for MYC translocation breakpoints by FISH. The probes consisted of multi-YAC constructs that flanked the breakpoint region and that, therefore, separate upon a chromosomal translocation and generate split (or ""segregated"") signals (rather than a more ambiguous ""co-localization"" pattern, obtained when the two partners in a hybrid gene are detected). The results were assessed by a simple approach that avoids the counting of signal numbers per nucleus and so is appropriate for use in routine practice. A total of 19 of the 36 lymphomas were scored as positive for MYC translocation and this included 16 of the 20 patients in whom classic cytogenetics had shown the presence of the (8;14) translocation (or one of its two variants). We conclude that this two-colour ""split-signal"" technique based on breakpoint flanking probes can readily detect chromosomal translocations in paraffin sections.

For Chronic myeloid leukaemia: further assessment required.,49-52,"(1) Chronic myeloid leukaemia goes through three clinical phases: a chronic phase, an acceleration phase, and a terminal blast crisis. In the chronic phase, interferon alfa-2 is more effective than cytotoxic chemotherapies but it also has more adverse effects. (2) Imatinib inhibits tyrosine kinase, an enzyme encoded by the pathological gene BCR-ABL, which is created during a reverse translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (characteristic of chronic myeloid leukaemia). This translocation almost always creates the pathological chromosome Philadelphia in blood cell lines. (3) 1 027 patients were recruited to three non comparative trials of imatinib, each focusing on a different phase of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Efficacy was evaluated largely on the basis of blood cell count and clearance of cells harbouring the Philadelphia chromosome. (4) During the chronic phase, in patients in whom interferon alfa-2 had failed or been poorly tolerated, a major cytogenetic response, lasting at least one month, occurred in 35% of patients on imatinib, compared to 20% of patients on interferon alfa-2 + cytarabine (historical comparison). It is not known whether this translated into longer survival. (5) Preliminary results from a randomised but unblinded trial comparing imatinib with interferon + cytarabine seem to favour imatinib. Some patients developed relapses resistant to imatinib, owing to mutations in the BCR-ABL gene. (6) In patients going through the acceleration phase or blast crisis, imatinib did not improve survival compared with standard treatments. (7) The main adverse effects so far described with imatinib are gastrointestinal problems, oedema and fluid retention, and muscle and joint pain, which prompted patients to stop treatment in no more than 5% of cases. (8) Imatinib has a strong potential to interact with other drugs, including paracetamol, but few specific studies have been done. (9) In practice imatinib may be a useful option during the chronic phase, after interferon alfa-2 has failed or been stopped because of adverse effects, provided that its benefits, so far shown only in surrogate endpoints, translate into longer survival. During the acceleration phase and blast crisis imatinib may cause fewer side effects than existing treatments.",,,,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",France,Prescrire Int,Prescrire international,9439295,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",,2003/04/03 05:00,2003/04/19 05:00,['2003/04/03 05:00'],"['2003/04/03 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/03 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prescrire Int. 2003 Apr;12(64):49-52.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is far from uniform in presentation and clinical course. About one-third of patients never require treatment and have a long survival; in another third an initial indolent phase is followed by progression of the disease; the remaining third of patients have aggressive disease at the outset and need immediate treatment. During recent years the development of biologic markers has allowed a better definition of prognosis in CLL. Serum levels of beta 2-microglobulin, LDH, and soluble CD23 can help predict disease activity, but the presence in the leukemic B cells of cytogenetic abnormalities like 11q or 11p deletions, the presence of the CD38 marker or somatic mutations in the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes are better predictors of rapid progression and survival. These recent results could suggest that there are two types of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: one arises from relatively less differentiated (immunologically naive) B cells with unmutated heavy chain genes, and has a poor prognosis; the other evolves from more differentiated B cells (memory B cells) with somatically mutated heavy chain genes, and has a good prognosis.

We evaluated CMB-401 as monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent platinum-sensitive epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC). Twenty-one 21 women aged 38 to 80 years with recurrent EOC (recurrence >6 months after initial platinum-containing chemotherapy) were enrolled. Tumor response and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were assessed before and after active treatment. After an initial intravenous (i.v.) dose of hCTM01 (without calicheamicin), the calicheamicin-linked CMB-401 (16 mg/m(2 ) i.v.) was administered over 60 min for up to 7 cycles, with 4 weeks between cycles. Nineteen patients were evaluable. Measurable changes observed following administration of CMB-401 did not meet the criteria for partial remission (PR). CMB-401 was not effective as monotherapy for this type of EOC. Adverse events experienced by patients in the study included nausea (95%), asthenia (90%), abdominal pain (62%), headache (57%), anorexia (57%), and diarrhea (57%), mostly at a toxicity grade level of 1 or 2. Based on published efficacy of conjugates that deliver calicheamicin via hybrid (bifunctional) linkers [e.g. gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) in acute myeloid leukemia], we hypothesize that the amide linker used in CMB-401 may have contributed to its failure to induce PR in patients in this study. Use of hybrid linkers to target hCTM01 or other antibodies to EOC may warrant further investigation.","['Chan, Stephen Y', 'Gordon, Alan N', 'Coleman, Robert E', 'Hall, James B', 'Berger, Mark S', 'Sherman, Matthew L', 'Eten, Catharine B', 'Finkler, Neil J']","['Chan SY', 'Gordon AN', 'Coleman RE', 'Hall JB', 'Berger MS', 'Sherman ML', 'Eten CB', 'Finkler NJ']","['Oncology Unit, Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham NG5 1PB, UK. ytschan@innotts.co.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Aminoglycosides', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/*drug therapy', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Enediynes', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Platinum Compounds/therapeutic use']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2002/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2002/09/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-002-0343-x [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Apr;52(4):243-8. doi: 10.1007/s00262-002-0343-x.

Leukemia cells from 12 consecutive ALL patients with high peripheral blood blast counts were studied. Proliferative T-cell responses were detected for a majority of these patients when irradiated leukemia blasts were used as accessory cells during activation. T-cell cytokine release was also observed for most patients when using nonirradiated ALL accessory cells. Low or undetectable cytokine levels were usually observed for CD8+ clones, whereas the CD4+ clones often showed a broad cytokine response with release of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-10, IL-13 and interferon gamma(IFN-gamma) in the presence of the ALL accessory cells. ALL blasts were also able to function as allostimulatory cells for normal peripheral blood mononuclear responder cells. However, both T-cell proliferation and cytokine release showed a wide variation between ALL patients. The accessory cell function of ALL blasts showed no correlation with the release of immunomodulatory mediators (IL-2, IL-10, IL-15) or the expression of any single adhesion/costimulatory membrane molecule (CD54, CD58, CD80, CD86) by the blasts. We conclude that for a majority of patients, native ALL blasts can mediate costimulatory signals needed for accessory cell-dependent T-cell activation, but differences in costimulatory capacity between ALL patients affects both the proliferative responsiveness and cytokine release by activated T cells.","['Bruserud, Oystein', 'Ulvestad, Elling']","['Bruserud O', 'Ulvestad E']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, N-5021, Bergen, Norway, oystein.bruserud@haukeland.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/immunology/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/*biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/immunology/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/05/21 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2002/08/22 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/21 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00262-002-0364-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2003 Apr;52(4):215-25. doi: 10.1007/s00262-002-0364-5.

METHODS: GMPR2 cDNA was cloned from the cDNA library of human dendritic cells and was characterized by Bioinformatics. The expression pattern of GMPR2 was analyzed by Northern blotting. The enzymatic activity of the purified recombinant GMPR2 protein was determined using a spectrophotometric assay. HL-60 leukemia cells were transfected with GMPR2 and the expression of CD14 and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in HL-60 cells with and without 12- o-tetra-decanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induction was monitored by FACS analysis. RESULTS: The novel gene contained ten exons and nine introns and was mapped to 14q11-21. Northern blotting indicated a ubiquitous expression of GMPR2 mRNA in most of the human tissues and cancer cell lines investigated. The recombinant GMPR2 protein was able to reduce GMP. The expression of CD14 and MPO in HL-60 leukemia cells overexpressing GMPR2 clearly increased after induction by TPA.

In the immune system, impaired PI3K signalling leads to immunodeficiency, whereas unrestrained PI3K signalling contributes to autoimmunity and leukaemia. New insights into the role of PI3Ks in lymphocyte biology have been derived from gene-targeting studies, which have identified the PI3K subunits that are involved in B-cell and T-cell signalling. In particular, the catalytic subunit p110delta seems to be adapted to transmit antigen-receptor signalling in B and T cells.

In some cases, the hepatic lymphoma has been diagnosed in patients who were infected by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). It has been suggested that HCV plays a role in the pathogenesis of lymphoma. The aim of our multicentric retrospective study was to assess the characteristics of PLL and to determine the prevalence of HCV infection in PLL. Thirty-one immunocompetent patients (anti-human immunodeficiency virus, anti-human T-cell leukemia/lymphoma virus negative, no history of allograft) with PLL fulfilled the entire selection criteria. The liver biopsy specimens were reassessed by the same pathologist. The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were classified according to the World Health Organization classification. Blood samples were tested in 28 patients for antibodies to HCV, and HCV RNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In the majority of cases, the clinical, biologic, and radiologic data were nonspecific. Twenty-seven of 31 patients presented a B-cell lymphoma corresponding to the centroblastic morphologic variant of a diffuse, large B-cell lymphoma (22 cases), a Burkitt's lymphoma (1 case), an extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue type (3 cases), and unclassified, small B-cell lymphoma (1 case). The 4 other cases were T-cell lymphomas. The prevalence of HCV infection was 21% (6 of 28 cases). All of these patients were positive for HCV RNA by polymerase chain reaction in blood. Most of the HCV-infected patients presented a high-grade, B-cell type lymphoma. In conclusion, our study confirms the rarity of PLL and demonstrates an increased prevalence of HCV infection.","['Bronowicki, Jean-Pierre', 'Bineau, Catherine', 'Feugier, Pierre', 'Hermine, Olivier', 'Brousse, Nicole', 'Oberti, Frederic', 'Rousselet, Marie-Christine', 'Dharancy, Sebastien', 'Gaulard, Philippe', 'Flejou, Jean-Francois', 'Cazals-Hatem, Dominique', 'Labouyrie, Eric']","['Bronowicki JP', 'Bineau C', 'Feugier P', 'Hermine O', 'Brousse N', 'Oberti F', 'Rousselet MC', 'Dharancy S', 'Gaulard P', 'Flejou JF', 'Cazals-Hatem D', 'Labouyrie E']","['Department of Hepato-gastroenterologie, INSERM EMI 0014, CHU, Nancy, France.jp.bronowicki@chu-nancy.fr']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hepatology,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",8302946,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/complications/epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy/*virology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy/*virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/jhep.2003.50121 [doi]', 'S0270913903000466 [pii]']",ppublish,Hepatology. 2003 Apr;37(4):781-7. doi: 10.1053/jhep.2003.50121.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 2,005 female patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following regimens: (I) sequential A x 4 (doses) --> T x 4 --> C x 4 with doses every 3 weeks, (II) sequential A x 4 --> T x 4 --> C x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim, (III) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 3 weeks, or (IV) concurrent AC x 4 --> T x 4 every 2 weeks with filgrastim. RESULTS: A protocol-specified analysis was performed at a median follow-up of 36 months: 315 patients had experienced relapse or died, compared with 515 expected treatment failures. Dose-dense treatment improved the primary end point, DFS (risk ratio [RR] = 0.74; P =.010), and OS (RR = 0.69; P =.013). Four-year DFS was 82% for the dose-dense regimens and 75% for the others. There was no difference in either DFS or OS between the concurrent and sequential schedules. There was no interaction between density and sequence. Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens. CONCLUSION: Dose density improves clinical outcomes significantly, despite the lower than expected number of events at this time.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1981 and 1998, the GHSG conducted three trial generations for early, intermediate, and advanced HD involving a total of 5,411 patients (called HD1 through HD9). RESULTS: A total of 46 patients with secondary AML/MDS were identified. The median age at diagnosis of leukemia was 47 years (range, 22 to 79 years). Primary therapy was as follows: radiotherapy alone (n = 4); doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD; n = 1); cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (COPP)/ABVD or similar (n = 30); bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (BEACOPP) baseline (n = 2); and BEACOPP escalated (n = 9). Twelve patients developed AML/MDS after salvage therapy, including four patients who developed AML/MDS after high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem-cell transplantation. Thirty-six of the secondary malignancies were AML, and 10 malignancies were MDS. After a median observation time of 55 months, incidence of secondary AML/MDS was 1%. Treatment for secondary AML/MDS was as follows: cytarabine (Ara-C)-containing regimens (6-thioguanin, cytarabine, daunorubicin [TAD]/high-dose cytarabine, mitoxantrone [HAM], HAM, Ida-Ara-C (idarubicin + Ara-C), Ida-Flag (idarubicin, fludarabin, Ara-C, G-CSF), and idarubicin, cytarabine, etoposide [ICE]+HAM; n = 11), TAD-chemotherapy (n = 5), other regimens (n = 3), no treatment or supportive care (n = 24), palliative oral chemotherapy (n = 3), and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (n = 9). After 24 months of observation, no difference in freedom from treatment failure and overall survival (2% and 8%, respectively) was observed in patients who developed AML or MDS. CONCLUSION: The prognosis of patients with secondary AML/MDS after primary HD is poor. Thus, emphasis should be made to improve initial treatment in an attempt to prevent this complication.","['Josting, Andreas', 'Wiedenmann, Sabine', 'Franklin, Jeremy', 'May, Michael', 'Sieber, Markus', 'Wolf, Juergen', 'Engert, Andreas', 'Diehl, Volker']","['Josting A', 'Wiedenmann S', 'Franklin J', 'May M', 'Sieber M', 'Wolf J', 'Engert A', 'Diehl V']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne, Joseph-Stelzmann-Str. 9, 50924 Cologne, Germany. andreas.josting@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1200/JCO.2003.07.160 [doi]', 'JCO.2003.07.160 [pii]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Sep 15;21(18):3440-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.07.160.

Here we compare the characteristics of several polyvalent cations and Mg(2+) to block monovalent MIC current from the outside. Putrescine, spermidine, spermine, PhTX-343 (a derivative of the naturally occurring polyamine toxin philanthotoxin), and Mg(2+) each blocked in a dose- and voltage-dependent manner, indicating a blocking site within the electric field of the ion channel. Spermine and the relatively bulky PhTX-343 exhibited voltage dependence steeper than that expected for the number of charges on the molecule. Polyamines and Mg(2+) are permeant blockers, as judged by relief of block at strongly negative membrane potentials.

We hypothesized that superoxide formation at different subcellular locations following cardiac I/R injury may differentially regulate cellular responses that determine pathophysiologic outcomes. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing Cu/ZnSOD or MnSOD were utilized to modulate superoxide levels in the cytoplasmic or mitochondrial compartments, respectively, prior to coronary artery I/R injury in the rat heart. Ectopic expression of both MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD afforded protection from I/R injury, as evidenced by a significant reduction in serum creatine kinase levels, infarct size, malondialdehyde levels, and apoptotic cell death in comparison to controls. MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD expression also significantly altered the kinetics of NF kappa B and AP-1 activation following I/R injury, characterized by a delayed induction of NF kappa B and abrogated AP-1 response. Western blot analysis of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bad, Caspase 3, PDK1, and phospho-Akt also revealed SOD-mediated changes in gene expression consistent with protection and decreased apoptosis. These findings support the notion that both mitochondrial and cytoplasmic-derived SOD induce changes in AP-1 and NF kappa B activity, creating an antiapoptotic microenvironment within cardiomyocytes that affords protection following I/R injury.","['Yang, Jusan', 'Marden, Jennifer J', 'Fan, Chenguang', 'Sanlioglu, Salih', 'Weiss, Robert M', 'Ritchie, Teresa C', 'Davisson, Robin L', 'Engelhardt, John F']","['Yang J', 'Marden JJ', 'Fan C', 'Sanlioglu S', 'Weiss RM', 'Ritchie TC', 'Davisson RL', 'Engelhardt JF']","['Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, The Center for Gene Therapy of Cystic Fibrosis and Other Genetic Disorders, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa 52242 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Creatine Kinase/blood', 'Genes, bcl-2/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Male', 'Malondialdehyde/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Myocardial Reperfusion Injury/metabolism/pathology/*prevention & control', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/*metabolism', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(02)00061-8 [pii]', '10.1016/s1525-0016(02)00061-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Mar;7(3):341-53. doi: 10.1016/s1525-0016(02)00061-8.,"['DK51315/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL60316/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 DK54759/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Bad protein, rat)', '0 (Bcl2l1 protein, rat)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '4Y8F71G49Q (Malondialdehyde)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinically, PNH is dominated by a chronic hemolytic anemia, often associated with recurrent nocturnal exacerbations, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic tendency. Allogenic bone marrow transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment for severe forms of PNH but is associated with a high treatment-related morbidity and mortality. HSC gene therapy could provide a new therapeutic option, especially when an HLA-matched donor is not available. To develop an efficient gene transfer approach, we have designed a new SIN lentiviral vector (TEPW) that contains the PIGA cDNA driven by the human elongation factor 1 alpha promoter, the central DNA flap of HIV-1, and the WPRE cassette. TEPW transduction led to a complete surface expression of the GPI anchor and CD59 in PIGA-deficient cell lines without any selection procedure. Moreover, efficient gene transfer was achieved in bone marrow and mobilized peripheral blood CD34(+) cells derived from two patients with severe PNH disease. This expression was stable during erythroid, myeloid, and megakaryocytic liquid culture differentiation. CD59 surface cell expression was fully restored during 5 weeks of long-term culture.","['Robert, David', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier', 'Richard, Emmanuel', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'de Verneuil, Hubert', 'Moreau-Gaudry, Francois']","['Robert D', 'Mahon FX', 'Richard E', 'Etienne G', 'de Verneuil H', 'Moreau-Gaudry F']","['INSERM E 0217, Laboratoire de Pathologie Moleculaire et Therapie Genique, Universite Victor Segalen Bordeaux 2, 146 Rue Leo Saignat, 33076 Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'CD59 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'HIV/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/blood/metabolism/*therapy', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*therapy', 'Luminescent Proteins/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Elongation Factor 1/genetics', 'Transfection']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1525-0016(03)00011-X [pii]', '10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00011-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2003 Mar;7(3):304-16. doi: 10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00011-x.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Elongation Factor 1)', '0 (phosphatidylinositol glycan-class A protein)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic myeloid leukemia, changes in the methylation status of the CpG-rich islands at several sites in the proximal ABL1 promoter (Pa) on the Philadelphia (Ph)-chromosome have been observed. It remains unclear if the Pa methylation precedes the translocation event (t9;22) that generates the Ph-chromosome or if Pa methylation is a stochastic event in a progenitor cell which will later acquire other mutations, namely t9;22. The present study was conducted to answer two questions: What is the methylation status of Pa in patients with Ph-negative myeloproliferative disorders (MPD)? Can the study of methylation in patients with Ph-negative MPD shed light on the initial events associated with the translocation? To probe CpG methylation, we used two methodologies; site-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme assay and methylation-specific PCR analysis following modification of genomic DNA by bisulfite. Results showed that 22 of the 97 patients with Ph-negative MPD expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. Seven of the 97 patients possessed methylated Pa, but only 2 of them expressed BCR-ABL transcripts. In some of the patients, Pa methylation was a dynamic event. In conclusion, aberrant methylation in Ph-negative MPD could be an initial event triggering the occurrence of the t9;22 translocation and its clinical expression. These findings may shed light on the pathogenesis and progression of MPD.","['Aviram, Adina', 'Witenberg, Bruria', 'Shaklai, Mati', 'Blickstein, Dorit']","['Aviram A', 'Witenberg B', 'Shaklai M', 'Blickstein D']","['Institute of Hematology, Rabin Medical Center, Beilinson Campus and Felsenstein Medical Research Center, Petah Tikva 49100, Israel. adinaav@clalit.org.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Alleles', 'CpG Islands/genetics', 'DNA/genetics/metabolism', '*DNA Methylation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Restriction Mapping/methods', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2004/01/31 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/01/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S1079979603000159 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00015-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2003 Jan-Feb;30(1):100-6. doi: 10.1016/s1079-9796(03)00015-9.,,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study examined whether LIF also inhibits progression of pre-existing atheroma. METHODS: Balloon angioplasty was performed on the right carotid arteries of 18 rabbits immediately before placing animals on a cholesterol-enriched diet. After 4 weeks, at which time the intima:media ratio (I:M) was 0.99+/-0.12 (n=6), osmotic minipumps containing LIF (n=6) or saline control (n=6) were inserted into the peritoneal cavity of each of the remaining rabbits for a further 4 weeks. Arteries were then harvested for analysis. RESULTS: Continuous administration of LIF for the final 4 weeks of an 8-week cholesterol-enriched diet completely inhibited lesion progression in injured carotid arteries (I:M 1.05+/-0.16) compared with the saline-treated group at 8 weeks (1.62+/-0.13; P<0.05). Similarly in contralateral uninjured carotid arteries, LIF treatment prevented an increase in I:M from a baseline of 0.11+/-0.01 at 4 weeks to 0.15+/-0.02 at 8 weeks compared with 0.40+/-0.04 for the saline-treated group at 8 weeks (P<0.05). LIF reduced the number of macrophages in the neointima of uninjured arteries, but had no effect on the cellular composition of injured arteries. LIF treatment normalised smooth muscle-dependent vasoreactivity to phenylephrine and sodium nitroprusside in both injured and uninjured arteries. Expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were up-regulated in response to hypercholesterolemia with levels further increased following endothelial denudation. With LIF treatment, iNOS expression was increased in uninjured arteries but marginally reduced in injured arteries. LIF receptors were expressed in both uninjured and injured arteries, with LIF treatment having no significant effect on expression levels. CONCLUSION: LIF prevents progression of pre-formed atherosclerotic plaques, affecting lesion size and vascular reactivity. LIF treatment has differential effects within the artery wall, depending on the presence or absence of de-endothelialisation injury.","['Rolfe, Barbara E', 'Stamatiou, Steve', 'World, Cameron J', 'Brown, Lindsay', 'Thomas, Anita C', 'Bingley, John A', 'Worth, Nathalie F', 'Campbell, Julie H']","['Rolfe BE', 'Stamatiou S', 'World CJ', 'Brown L', 'Thomas AC', 'Bingley JA', 'Worth NF', 'Campbell JH']","['Centre for Research in Vascular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cardiovasc Res,Cardiovascular research,0077427,IM,"['Acetylcholine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Arteriosclerosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Carotid Arteries/drug effects/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry/methods', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Male', 'Models, Animal', 'Molecular Chaperones/*therapeutic use', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II', 'Nitroprusside/pharmacology', 'Phenylephrine/pharmacology', '*Proteins', 'Rabbits', 'Serotonin/pharmacology', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents/pharmacology']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0008636302008325 [pii]', '10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00832-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cardiovasc Res. 2003 Apr 1;58(1):222-30. doi: 10.1016/s0008-6363(02)00832-5.,,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Vasoconstrictor Agents)', '169D1260KM (Nitroprusside)', '1WS297W6MV (Phenylephrine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'N9YNS0M02X (Acetylcholine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, we have constructed a plasmid that induces in bacteria the synthesis of a soluble and highly active reverse transcriptase (RT) of PERV-B. The purified PERV RT was studied biochemically in comparison with the RT of murine leukemia virus (MLV), because of the high-sequence homology between these two RTs. The data show that in several properties the two enzymes are similar, particularly regarding the monomeric subunit composition of the proteins in solution, the high resistance to deoxynucleoside analogues, and the pattern of RNA cleavage by the ribonuclease H activity (RNase H) of the RTs. However, in several cases there are apparent differences between the two RTs, most notable the divalent cation preference (Mn(+2) versus Mg(+2)) in the DNA polymerase reactions. As already shown for viral PERV RT, the novel recombinant PERV RT exhibits a relatively high resistance to several deoxynucleoside analogue inhibitors, suggesting that they might not be very efficient in inhibiting the replication of PERV virions. Therefore, the availability of large amounts of the recombinant RT can be useful for a wide screening of novel drugs against infectious PERV.","['Avidan, Orna', 'Loya, Shoshana', 'Tonjes, Ralf R', 'Sevilya, Ziv', 'Hizi, Amnon']","['Avidan O', 'Loya S', 'Tonjes RR', 'Sevilya Z', 'Hizi A']","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors', 'Protein Subunits', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Swine/*virology']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/05/09 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0042682202001319 [pii]', '10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00131-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Virology. 2003 Mar 15;307(2):341-57. doi: 10.1016/s0042-6822(02)00131-9.,,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleic Acid Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, from a pharmacological point of view, Pt(II) complexes of Bohemine may represent compounds for a new class of antitumor drugs.","['Travnicek, Zdenek', 'Malon, Michal', 'Zatloukal, Marek', 'Dolezal, Karel', 'Strnad, Miroslav', 'Marek, Jaromir']","['Travnicek Z', 'Malon M', 'Zatloukal M', 'Dolezal K', 'Strnad M', 'Marek J']","['Department of Inorganic and Physical Chemistry, Palacky University, Krizkovskeho 10, CZ-771 47 Olomouc, Czech Republic. trav@aix.upol.cz']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Inorg Biochem,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,7905788,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetin', 'Ligands', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Organoplatinum Compounds/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Palladium/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Platinum/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Purines/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0162013403000515 [pii]', '10.1016/s0162-0134(03)00051-5 [doi]']",ppublish,J Inorg Biochem. 2003 Apr 1;94(4):307-16. doi: 10.1016/s0162-0134(03)00051-5.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organoplatinum Compounds)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (bohemine)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '5TWQ1V240M (Palladium)', '6A839B2HYS (olomoucine)', 'P39Y9652YJ (Kinetin)']",,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proteins known to activate caspase-family cell death proteases (cytochrome c; granzyme-B; caspase-8) were introduced into human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, as well as freshly isolated lymphocytes and leukemia cells, by electroporation. Fluorochrome-labeled proteins with a wide range of molecular weights (from 15 to 150 kDa) were used to evaluate electroporation efficiency by flow cytometry and to compare the efficiency of protein delivery using various electroporation conditions. Caspase activity was monitored using a cleavable, cell-permeable fluorogenic substrate. Conditions were identified for efficient delivery of proteins of +150 kDa into lymphoid cells. Caspase activation induced by various proteins was compared in normal and leukemic lymphocytic cells, revealing impaired caspase activation pathways in some malignant cells. We conclude that electroporation of apoptotic proteins into intact lymphoid cells can be used to contrast the status of various caspase activation pathways, thereby providing insights into the pathological defects in apoptosis regulation that exist in individual patient specimens.","['Eksioglu-Demiralp, Emel', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Carson, Denise', 'Garland, John', 'Andreef, Michael', 'Reed, John C']","['Eksioglu-Demiralp E', 'Kitada S', 'Carson D', 'Garland J', 'Andreef M', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, 10901 N.

METHODS: HepG2 cells were cultured in MEM medium and treated with 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 micro mol/L As(2)O(3) for either 24 h or 96 h at each concentration. In situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) labeling (TUNEL) and DNA ladders were used to detect apoptosis. Confocal microscopy and Western blotting were used to observe the expression of PML. RESULTS: The growth rates of HepG2 cells were slower in the As(2)O(3) treated than the untreated control group. DNA ladder and TUNEL positive apoptotic cells could be detected in As(2)O(3) treated groups. The expression of PML decreased in HepG2 cells with 2 micro mol/L As(2)O(3) treatment. Confocal images demonstrated that the expression of PML protein in HepG2 cell nuclei decreased after treatment with 2 micro mol/L As(2)O(3), and micropunctates characteristic of PML protein in HepG2 cell nuclei disappeared after treatment with 5 micro mol/L As(2)O(3). CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that arsenic trioxide can significantly inhibit the growth of HepG2 cells in vitro. As(2)O(3) induces apoptosis in HepG2 tumor cells in a time and concentration dependent manner. As(2)O(3) may degrade the PML protein in HepG2 cell nuclei.

METHODS: We detected apoptosis of HL-60 cells and peripheral blood leukemia cells in 17 patients at different stages, using in situ terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) fluorescence measurement and DNA electrophoresis. RESULTS: When HL-60 cells were incubated with 0.02 mg/L harringtonine for 0 to 48 hours, agarose gel electrophoresis showed that DNA ladder patterns became evident only at 12 hour into the treatment. In situ TdT assay showed that apoptotic cells occurred after one hour of the treatment. Apoptotic cells were few (0 - 3.3%) before chemotherapy, but increased substantially (11.4% - 87.5%) during chemotherapy in patients with complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR). Apoptotic cells were few (0 - 6.1%) during chemotherapy in ten patients with no remission (NR). DNA ladder cannot be detected by agarose gel electrophoresis either before, during or after chemotherapy. Wilcoxon signed rank test shows: P = 0.0012 < 0.01, apoptotic cells during chemotherapy were present in greater quantity than prior to chemotherapy. Wilcoxon rank sum test shows: P = 0.0011 < 0.01, with the median of apoptotic cells during chemotherapy in patients with CR or PR more than with NR. CONCLUSIONS: TdT assay can be used to detect apoptotic cells earlier and more sensitively than DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. In situ TdT assay is useful to detect apoptosis in vivo in the initial phase of chemotherapy for immediate modification of the chemotherapy regimen, whereas electrophoretic analysis is not sensitive enough to detect apoptotic cell in vivo. Where the median of apoptotic cells during chemotherapy in patients with CR or PR were greater than with NR, only effective drug therapy could induce apoptosis.","[""Cen, Xi'nan"", 'Zhu, Ping', 'Yu, Jiren', 'Shi, Yongjin', 'Ma, Mingxin']","['Cen X', 'Zhu P', 'Yu J', 'Shi Y', 'Ma M']","['Department of Hematology, The First Hospital of Beijing University, Beijing University, Beijing 100034, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Chin Med J (Engl),Chinese medical journal,7513795,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2003/04/02 05:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Chin Med J (Engl). 2003 Jan;116(1):74-7.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When inappropriately expressed, as is common in leukaemia and epithelial cancers of the breast, colon and gastro-oesophagus, c-Myb appears to activate gene targets of key importance to cancer progression and metastasis. These genes include cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), Bcl-2, BclX(L) and c-Myc, which influence diverse processes such as angiogenesis, proliferation and apoptosis. The clinical potential for blocking c-Myb expression in malignancies is based upon strong preclinical data and some trial-based evidence. The modest clinical experience to date has been with haematopoietic malignancies, but other disease classes may be amenable to similar interventions. The frontline agents to achieve this are nuclease-resistant oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs), which are proving to be acceptable therapeutic reagents in terms of tolerable toxicities and delivery. Nevertheless, further effort must be focused on improving their efficacy, eliminating non-specific toxicity and optimising delivery. Optimisation issues aside, it would appear that anti-c-Myb therapies will be used with most success when combined with other agents, some of which will be established cytotoxic and differentiation-inducing drugs. This review will explore the future strategic use of ODNs in vivo, focusing on a wide spectrum of diseases, including several beyond the haematopoietic malignancies, in which c-Myb appears to play a role.","['Ramsay, Robert G', 'Barton, Anna L', 'Gonda, Thomas J']","['Ramsay RG', 'Barton AL', 'Gonda TJ']","['Differentiation and Transcription Group, Trescowthick Laboratories, Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, Victoria, Australia. r.ramsay@pmci.unimelb.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma/drug therapy/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Delivery Systems', '*Drug Design', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Genes, myb/*drug effects', 'HIV Infections/drug therapy/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/drug effects', 'RNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/drug effects', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",92,2003/04/02 05:00,2006/05/09 09:00,['2003/04/02 05:00'],"['2003/04/02 05:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/09 09:00 [medline]', '2003/04/02 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1517/14728222.7.2.235 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2003 Apr;7(2):235-48. doi: 10.1517/14728222.7.2.235.,,"['0 (Anti-HIV Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the ability of primary human foreskin fibroblasts to secrete high levels of hEpo and the importance of cis-acting elements and infection conditions on transgene expression level were assessed. METHODS: The transduction efficiency was first evaluated with beta-galactosidase (LacZ)-encoding retroviral vectors derived from the murine leukemia retrovirus (MLV) pseudotyped either with an amphotropic envelope or with the G glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). Human fibroblasts were then infected with an amphotropic hEpo-expressing retroviral vector, which was modified by insertion of a post-transcriptional regulatory element from the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE) and a Kozak consensus sequence (KZ). Human Epo production was further optimized by increasing the multiplicity of infection and by selecting high producer cells. The survival and the transgene expression of these fibroblasts were finally evaluated in vivo. The cells were encapsulated into microporous hollow fibers and subcutaneously implanted in nude mice. RESULTS: A secretion level of approximately 5 IU hEpo/10(6) cells/day was obtained with the basal vector. A 7.5-fold increase in transgene expression was observed with the insertion of WPRE and KZ elements. Finally, according to the optimization of infection conditions, we obtained a 40-fold increase in hEpo secretion, reaching approximately 200 IU hEpo/10(6) cells/day. The in vivo experiments showed an increase in the hematocrit during the first 2 weeks and elevated levels exceeding 60% were maintained over a 6-week period. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that primary human fibroblasts represent a promising source for encapsulated cell therapy.","['Schwenter, F', 'Deglon, N', 'Aebischer, P']","['Schwenter F', 'Deglon N', 'Aebischer P']","['Division of Surgical Research & Gene Therapy Center, CHUV, Lausanne University Medical School, 1011 Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gene Med,The journal of gene medicine,9815764,IM,"['Animals', 'Erythropoietin/*genetics/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/transplantation', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genes, Reporter', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Leukemia Virus, Murine', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Transduction, Genetic']",,2003/04/01 05:00,2003/11/05 05:00,['2003/04/01 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jgm.338 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gene Med. 2003 Mar;5(3):246-57. doi: 10.1002/jgm.338.,,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],,,"['Copyright 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gastrointestinal bleeding and epistaxis were the most common spontaneous symptoms. Bleeding time was prolonged in most patients, associated with marked reductions in plasma von Willebrand factor antigen and ristocetin cofactor activity. Plasma VWF multimer distribution was normal (type 1 pattern) in 5 patients, indeterminate (no multimers detectable) in 6 patients (type 3 pattern), and abnormal (decreased higher-molecular-weight multimers, type 2 pattern) in 11 patients. None of 17 patients tested had an inhibitor of ristocetin cofactor activity. An underlying malignant or benign hematologic disease was found in 18 patients, and 1 patient had Crohn's disease.

Resolution of AVWS occurred with therapy of lymphoma (1 patient) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (1 patient). Sixteen patients were alive at last follow-up; no deaths were related to bleeding. AVWS may be more prevalent than has been appreciated; we estimate up to 0.04%. Awareness of the existence of AVWS is essential for diagnosis and appropriate management.

The literature reports nearly always compromised adults. CASE REPORTS: Two pediatric cases of central nervous system aspergillosis with different clinical course are presented. The first of them, is a immunocompetent person in whom a granulomatous disease of the central nervous system was suspected. The cultivation of stereotaxic biopsy reported thin septated hyphae. After 42 days of treatment with itraconazol the patient recovered completely. The second patient, had an acute lymphoblastic leukemia and developed a widespread aspergillosis including the central nervous system. In spite of antifungic treatment for 63 days, he died of heart failure. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of aspergillosis is difficult because of the poor specificity of the neuroimages, cerebrospinal fluid and complementary labs. The images are indistinguishable from acute ischemia infarcts and later those images change to abscesses. Direct KOH staining and the cultivation of biopsed samples confirmed the diagnosis of aspergillosis. An aggressive treatment with amphotericin B and itraconazol is recommended, but high mortality is suspected.

Some patients treated for primary malignancies with chemotherapeutic agents that inhibit DNA topoisomerase II (topo II) develop treatment-related leukemia (t-AML) caused by MLL gene rearrangement. Whether these patients are unusually susceptible to anti-topo II drugs, or whether this is a random adverse event is unknown. To discover genetic polymorphisms that may predispose patients to t-AML development, we sequenced the 8.3-kb MLL breakpoint cluster region (BCR) from 22 patients who had been treated with topo II inhibitors and who developed t-AML and from 37 patients who did not, and from eight infants and 20 normal individuals. Four polymorphic sites within Alu repetitive elements were identified; three affected the length of poly-A tracts and one altered the size of a trinucleotide repeat. The three poly-A tract polymorphisms occurred with equal frequency in leukemic patients and controls and hence are not predictors of risk. The trinucleotide GAA repeat has three alleles: (GAA)4, (GAA)5, and (GAA)6. The (GAA)6 allele is very rare. The adult t-AML patients are almost exclusively (GAA)4/5 heterozygotes (83%), whereas the normal population is only 55% (GAA)4/5 heterozygotic and is represented equally by (GAA)4 and (GAA)5 homozygotes (20% each).

It is becoming apparent that distinct molecular events are associated with specific stages in a multistep tumorigenic process with good genotype/ phenotype correlation. For instance, mutations of the gsp and thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor genes are associated with benign hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules and adenomas while alterations of other specific genes, such as oncogenic tyrosine kinase alterations (RET/PTC, TRK) in papillary carcinoma and the newly discovered PAX8/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma rearrangement, are distinctive features of cancer. Although activating RAS mutations occur at all stages of thyroid tumorigenesis, evidence is accumulating that they may also play an important role in tumor progression, a role that is well documented for p53. Environmental factors (iodine deficiency, ionizing radiations) have been shown to play a crucial role in promoting the development of thyroid cancer, influencing both its genotypic and phenotypic features. It is possible that the follicular thyroid cell has unique ways to respond to DNA damage. Similarly to leukemia or sarcomas (and unlike most epithelial cancers), numerous specific rearrangements are being discovered in thyroid cancer suggesting preferential activation of DNA repair instead of cell death programs after environmentally induced genetic alterations.","['Tallini, Giovanni']",['Tallini G'],"['Department of Pathology Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06510, USA. tallini@yale.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Endocr Pathol,Endocrine pathology,9009288,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/genetics/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/genetics/pathology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Thyrotropin/genetics/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Thyroid Gland/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/physiology']",104,2003/04/01 05:00,2003/07/26 05:00,['2003/04/01 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['EP:13:4:271 [pii]', '10.1385/ep:13:4:271 [doi]']",ppublish,Endocr Pathol. 2002 Winter;13(4):271-88. doi: 10.1385/ep:13:4:271.,,"['0 (Receptors, Thyrotropin)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with human papillomavirus E6 gene primers, an EST from the MOLT-4 T lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line was amplified. Via rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and cycle sequencing from MOLT-4 and fetal lung cDNA libraries, overlapping cDNAs of 2786 bp and 2054 bp of the corresponding novel human intronless gene designated MOST-1 (for MOLT-4 sequence tag-1) were characterised and assigned the symbol C8orf17 by the HUGO Nomenclature Committee. RESULTS: Both cDNAs contained a potential open reading frame (ORF) of 297 bp incorporating a methionine codon with an ideal Kozak consensus sequence for translation initiation, and encoding a putative hydrophilic polypeptide of 99 amino acids. Although reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) demonstrated MOST-1 expression in all 19 cancer and two normal cell lines tested, differential expression was seen in only nine of 16 normal tissues tested (heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, small intestine, ovary, testis, prostate, and thymus). A 388 bp fragment was amplified from the NS-1 mouse myeloma cell line, the sequence of which was identical to that within the MOST-1 ORF. The MOST-1 gene was mapped by fluorescent in situ hybridisation to chromosome 8q24.2, a region amplified in many breast cancers and prostate cancers, which is also the candidate site of potential oncogene(s) other than c-myc located at 8q24.1. Analysis of paired biopsies of invasive ductal breast cancer and adjacent normal tissue by semiquantitative and real time RT-PCR revealed average tumour to normal ratios of MOST-1 expression that were two times greater in grade 3 cancers than in grade 1 and 2 cancers. Quantitative real time PCR of archival prostatic biopsies displayed MOST-1 DNA values that were 9.9, 7.5, 4.2, and 1.4 times higher in high grade carcinomas, intermediate grade carcinomas, low grade carcinomas, and benign hyperplasias, respectively, than in normal samples. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a role for MOST-1 in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and carcinogenesis.","['Tan, J M M', 'Tock, E P C', 'Chow, V T K']","['Tan JM', 'Tock EP', 'Chow VT']","['Human Genome Laboratory, Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge 117597, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Pathol,Molecular pathology : MP,9706282,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/04/01 05:00,2003/06/07 05:00,['2003/04/01 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/07 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/mp.56.2.109 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pathol. 2003 Apr;56(2):109-15. doi: 10.1136/mp.56.2.109.,,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,PMC1187302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several complexes of this family have been reported for humans. In this study, two additional complexes are described that belong to the same SWI/SNF family. These new complexes contain as many as eight subunits identical to those found in other SWI/SNF complexes, and they possess a similar ATP-dependent nucleosome disruption activity. But unlike known SWI/SNFs, the new complexes are low in abundance and contain an extra subunit conserved between human and yeast SWI/SNF complexes. This subunit, ENL, is a homolog of the yeast SWI/SNF subunit, ANC1/TFG3. Moreover, ENL is a fusion partner for the gene product of MLL that is a common target for chromosomal translocations in human acute leukemia. The resultant MLL-ENL fusion protein associates and cooperates with SWI/SNF complexes to activate transcription of the promoter of HoxA7, a downstream target essential for oncogenic activity of MLL-ENL.

Although the induction of the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) is commonly used as an indicator for the UPR, the direct role of the GRPs in conferring resistance to DNA damaging agents has not been proven. We report here that without the use of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress inducers, specific overexpression of GRP78 results in reduced apoptosis and higher colony survival when challenged with topoisomerase II inhibitors, etoposide and doxorubicin, and topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. While investigating the mechanism for the GRP78 protective effect against etoposide-induced cell death, we discovered that in contrast to the UPR, GRP78 overexpression does not result in G1 arrest or depletion of topoisomerase II. Caspase-7, an executor caspase that is associated with the ER, is activated by etoposide. We show here that specific expression of GRP78 blocks caspase-7 activation by etoposide both in vivo and in vitro, and this effect can be reversed by addition of dATP in a cell-free system. Recently, it was reported that ectopically expressed GRP78 and caspases-7 and -12 form a complex, thus coupling ER stress to the cell death program. However, the mechanism of how GRP78, a presumably ER lumen protein, can regulate cytosolic effectors of apoptosis is not known. Here we provide evidence that a subpopulation of GRP78 can exist as an ER transmembrane protein, as well as co-localize with caspase-7, as confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. Co-immunoprecipitation studies further reveal endogenous GRP78 constitutively associates with procaspase-7 but not with procaspase-3. Lastly, a GRP78 mutant deleted of its ATP binding domain fails to bind procaspase-7 and loses its protective effect against etoposide-induced apoptosis.","['Reddy, Ramachandra K', 'Mao, Changhui', 'Baumeister, Peter', 'Austin, Richard C', 'Kaufman, Randal J', 'Lee, Amy S']","['Reddy RK', 'Mao C', 'Baumeister P', 'Austin RC', 'Kaufman RJ', 'Lee AS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the USC/Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90089-9176, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Binding Sites', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Caspase 7', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Chaperones/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms']",,2003/04/01 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/04/01 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212328200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)73395-8 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 6;278(23):20915-24. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212328200.

We found that treatment of adult male mice by ISO (15 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) caused a delayed STAT3 activation (at 60-120 min), which was fully abolished by beta-AR antagonist, propranolol. ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was markedly enhanced by phosphodiesterase inhibitor amrinone, indicating that cAMP is critically involved in beta-AR-mediated STAT3 activation. In addition, beta-AR stimulation significantly increased gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) family of cytokines (IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1). IL-6 protein levels in serum and mouse myocardium were also significantly increased in response to ISO treatment. In cultured cardiac fibroblasts, IL-6 level was enhanced significantly after ISO (10-6 mol/liter) stimulation for 2 h and then peaked at 12 h, whereas the response of IL-6 in cultured cardiomyocytes to ISO stimulation was not significant, suggesting that ISO-induced increase in IL-6 is primarily from cardiac fibroblasts rather than cardiomyocytes. Most importantly, IL-6 could activate STAT3 in a time-dependent manner in cultured cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of IL-6 level by anti-IL-6-neutralizing antibody clearly attenuated ISO-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 in myocardium. Taken together, these results indicate that beta-AR stimulation leads to a delayed STAT3 activation via an IL-6 family of cytokine-mediated pathway and that cardiac fibroblasts, but not cardiomyocytes, is probably the predominant source of IL-6 in response to ISO stimulation in mouse myocardium.","['Yin, Feng', 'Li, Ping', 'Zheng, Ming', 'Chen, Li', 'Xu, Qi', 'Chen, Kai', 'Wang, Yong-yu', 'Zhang, You-yi', 'Han, Chide']","['Yin F', 'Li P', 'Zheng M', 'Chen L', 'Xu Q', 'Chen K', 'Wang YY', 'Zhang YY', 'Han C']","[""Institute of Vascular Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital and The Reference Laboratory of Education Ministry on Molecular Cardiology, Beijing 100083, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adrenergic beta-Agonists/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology', 'Interleukin-6/genetics/*immunology/metabolism', 'Isoproterenol/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 1', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myocardium/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Myocytes, Cardiac/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/immunology', 'Ventricular Remodeling/drug effects/physiology']",,2003/04/01 05:00,2003/07/19 05:00,['2003/04/01 05:00'],"['2003/04/01 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/19 05:00 [medline]', '2003/04/01 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M211028200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)73414-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Jun 6;278(23):21070-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M211028200.

The underlying mechanism leading to cell transformation is the activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as a consequence of proviral insertions into the host genome. Cells carrying proviral insertions that confer a selective advantage will preferentially grow out. This means that proviral insertions mark genes contributing to tumorigenesis, as was demonstrated by the identification of numerous proto-oncogenes in retrovirally induced tumors in the past. Since cancer is a complex multistep process, the proviral insertions in one clone of tumor cells also represent oncogenic events that cooperate in tumorigenesis.

These can be noisy, unstable, and highly platform-specific. In this article, we emphasize the notion of molecular profiles based on latent categories signifying under-, over-, and baseline expression. Following this approach, we can generate results that are more easily interpretable, more easily translated into clinical tools, more robust to noise, and less platform-dependent.

Viral infectivity assays were performed with SNV and amphotropic Murine leukemia virus (MLV-A) pseudotyped vector viruses to measure titers in D-17 cells expressing HERV-W Env and in negative control cells. The HERV-W Env caused fusion of D-17 cells in culture and greatly reduced infection by SNV vector virus. A 1000- to 10,000-fold decrease in SNV infectivity was observed for D-17 cells expressing HERV-W Env as compared to D-17 cells that were not expressing HERV-W Env. In contrast, infection by MLV-A pseudotyped vector virus was not significantly reduced. Thus, HERV-W Env confers host cell resistance to infection by SNV.

The three known types of L domain, designated according to essential tetrapeptide motifs (PTAP, PPXY, or YPDL), each bind distinct cellular cofactors. We and others have demonstrated that recruitment of an ESCRT-I subunit, Tsg101, a component of the class E vacuolar protein sorting (VPS) machinery, is required for the budding of viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and Ebola virus, that encode a PTAP-type L domain, but subsequent events remain undefined. In this study, we demonstrate that VPS28, a second component of ESCRT-I, binds to a sequence close to the Tsg101 C terminus and is therefore recruited to the plasma membrane by HIV-1 Gag. In addition, we show that Tsg101 exhibits a multimerization activity. Using a complementation assay in which Tsg101 is artificially recruited to sites of HIV-1 assembly, we demonstrate that the integrity of the VPS28 binding site within Tsg101 is required for particle budding. In addition, mutation of a putative leucine zipper or residues important for Tsg101 multimerization also impairs the ability of Tsg101 to support HIV-1 budding. A minimal multimerizing Tsg101 domain is a dominant negative inhibitor of PTAP-mediated HIV-1 budding but does not inhibit YPDL-type or PPXY-type L-domain function. Nevertheless, YDPL-type L-domain activity is inhibited by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant of the class E VPS ATPase VPS4. These results indicate that all three classes of retroviral L domains require a functioning class E VPS pathway in order to effect budding. However, the PTAP-type L domain appears to be unique in its requirement for an intact, or nearly intact, ESCRT-I complex.","['Martin-Serrano, Juan', 'Zang, Trinity', 'Bieniasz, Paul D']","['Martin-Serrano J', 'Zang T', 'Bieniasz PD']","['Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and The Rockefeller University, New York, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport', 'HIV-1/genetics/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', '*Vesicular Transport Proteins', 'Virion/metabolism']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.8.4794-4804.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(8):4794-804. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.8.4794-4804.2003.,"['R01 AI052774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI52774/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tsg101 protein)', '0 (VPS28 protein, S cerevisiae)', '0 (Vesicular Transport Proteins)']",,PMC152150,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different members of the retrovirus family use one or the other strategy. Little is known about the uptake of foamy viruses (FV), a special group of retroviruses, into the target cells. In this study, we examined the pH dependence of FV entry by analyzing FV envelope glycoprotein (Env)-mediated infection of target cells with murine leukemia virus or FV vector pseudotypes in the presence of various lysosomotropic agents. Similar to vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G)-mediated uptake, FV Env-mediated entry was inhibited by various lysosomotropic agents, suggesting a pH-dependent endocytic pathway. However, in contrast to its effect on VSV-G pseudotypes, chloroquine failed to reduce the infectivity of FV Env pseudotypes, implying that the pathway is different from that of VSV-G. Glycoproteins of various other FV species showed inhibition profiles similar to that of the prototype FV (PFV) Env. Analysis of the pH dependence of the FV Env-mediated fusion process in a cell-to-cell fusion assay revealed an induction of syncytium formation by a short exposure to acidic pH, peaking around pH 5.5. Interestingly, of all FV Env species analyzed, only the PFV Env had a significant fusion activity at neutral pH. Taken together, these data suggest a pH-dependent endocytic pathway for infection of target cells by FV.","['Picard-Maureau, Marcus', 'Jarmy, Gergely', 'Berg, Angelika', 'Rethwilm, Axel', 'Lindemann, Dirk']","['Picard-Maureau M', 'Jarmy G', 'Berg A', 'Rethwilm A', 'Lindemann D']","['Institut fur Virologie und Immunbiologie, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Fusion', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Giant Cells', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/metabolism/pathogenicity', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', '*Macrolides', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Nigericin/pharmacology', 'Spumavirus/genetics/metabolism/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.8.4722-4730.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(8):4722-30. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.8.4722-4730.2003.,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '80890-47-7 (concanamycin A)', 'RRU6GY95IS (Nigericin)']",,PMC152125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the kinase activity of the protein is required for these events, most previously studied mutants encoding truncated v-Abl proteins that lack the extreme carboxyl terminus retain high transforming capacity in NIH 3T3 cells but transform lymphocytes poorly. To understand the mechanisms responsible for poor lymphoid transformation, mutants expressing a v-Abl protein lacking portions of the COOH terminus were compared for their ability to transform pre-B cells. Although all mutants lacking sequences within the COOH terminus were compromised for lymphoid transformation, loss of amino acids in the central region of the COOH terminus, including those implicated in JAK interaction and DNA binding, decreased transformation twofold or less. In contrast, loss of the extreme COOH terminus rendered the protein unstable and led to rapid proteosome-mediated degradation, a feature that was more prominent when the protein was expressed in Ab-MLV-transformed lymphoid cells. These data indicate that the central portion of the COOH terminus is not essential for lymphoid transformation and reveal that one important function of the COOH terminus is to stabilize the v-Abl protein in lymphoid cells.","['Warren, David', 'Griffin, Deborah S', 'Mainville, Celine', 'Rosenberg, Naomi']","['Warren D', 'Griffin DS', 'Mainville C', 'Rosenberg N']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Microbiology, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/*virology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins v-abl/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.8.4617-4625.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(8):4617-25. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.8.4617-4625.2003.,"['R01 CA024220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 24220/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (Dok1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GAP-associated protein p62)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-abl)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,PMC152141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, marker reassortment between coexpressed vectors was measured during single replication cycles, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) recombination was observed six- to sevenfold more frequently than murine leukemia virus (MLV) recombination. Template switching was also assayed by using transduction-type vectors in which donor and acceptor template regions were joined covalently. In this situation, where RNA copackaging could not vary, MLV and HIV-1 template switching rates were indistinguishable. These findings argue that MLV's lower intermolecular recombination frequency does not reflect enzymological differences. Instead, these data suggest that recombination rates differ because coexpressed MLV RNAs are less accessible to the recombination machinery than are coexpressed HIV RNAs. This hypothesis provides a plausible explanation for why most gammaretrovirus recombinants, although relatively rare, display evidence of multiple nonselected crossovers. By implying that recombinogenic template switching occurs roughly four times on average during the synthesis of every MLV or HIV-1 DNA, these results suggest that virtually all products of retroviral replication are biochemical recombinants.","['Onafuwa, Adewunmi', 'An, Wenfeng', 'Robson, Nicole D', 'Telesnitsky, Alice']","['Onafuwa A', 'An W', 'Robson ND', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'RNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', '*Templates, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.77.8.4577-4587.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2003 Apr;77(8):4577-87. doi: 10.1128/jvi.77.8.4577-4587.2003.,"['R29 CA069300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM64479/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA69300/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,PMC152108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of participants of the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study was used to compare 1,765 adult survivors of childhood ALL to 2,565 adult siblings of childhood cancer survivors. Body-mass index (BMI; kilograms per square meter), calculated from self-reported heights and weights, was used to determine the prevalence of being overweight (BMI, 25-29.9) or obese (BMI >or= 30.0). Polytomous logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for being overweight or obese among ALL survivors relative to the sibling control group. RESULTS: The age- and race-adjusted OR for being obese in survivors treated with cranial radiation doses >or= 20 Gy in comparison with siblings was 2.59 for females (95% CI, 1.88 to 3.55; P <.001) and 1.86 for males (95% CI, 1.33 to 2.57; P <.001). The OR for obesity was greatest among females diagnosed at 0 to 4 years of age and treated with radiation doses >or= 20 Gy (OR, 3.81; 95% CI, 2.34 to 5.99; P <.001). Obesity was not associated with treatment consisting of chemotherapy only or with cranial radiation doses of 10 to 19 Gy. CONCLUSION: Cranial radiotherapy >or= 20 Gy is associated with an increased prevalence of obesity, especially in females treated at a young age. It is imperative that healthcare professionals recognize this risk and develop strategies to enhance weight control and encourage longitudinal follow-up.","['Oeffinger, Kevin C', 'Mertens, Ann C', 'Sklar, Charles A', 'Yasui, Yutaka', 'Fears, Thomas', 'Stovall, Marilyn', 'Vik, Terry A', 'Inskip, Peter D', 'Robison, Leslie L']","['Oeffinger KC', 'Mertens AC', 'Sklar CA', 'Yasui Y', 'Fears T', 'Stovall M', 'Vik TA', 'Inskip PD', 'Robison LL']","['Department of Family Practice and Community Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, 753900-9067, USA. kevin.oeffinger@utsouthwestern.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Obesity/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Odds Ratio', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Survivors']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.06.131 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1359-65. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.06.131.,['5U01-CA-55727-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,['Childhood Cancer Survivor Study'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS: Between January 1, 1974, and March 31, 2001, 3,372 patients underwent SCT at the University of Minnesota. From these transplants, 147 posttransplant malignancies (PTMs) were identified in 137 patients. RESULTS: Excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers (n = 19) and carcinoma-in-situ (n = 5), the remaining 123 cases represented an 8.1-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to 9.6) increased risk of a PTM, an excess risk of 102.7 cases/10,000 persons/yr (age and sex adjusted). This includes a significantly elevated risk for developing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML; standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 300; 95% CI, 210 to 406), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD; SIR = 54.3; 95% CI, 39.5 to 41.1), Hodgkin's disease (SIR = 14.8; 95% CI, 3.9 to 32.9), or solid tumors overall (SIR = 2.8; CI, 2.0 to 3.7) and in specific for melanoma, brain, and oral cavity tumors. The cumulative incidence for the development of any PTM was 6.9% (95% CI, 5.2 to 8.6) at 20 years post-SCT. For PTLD (n = 43), the cumulative incidence plateaued at 1.4% (95% CI, 1.0 to 1.8) by 10 years post-SCT. For MDS or AML, the cumulative incidence plateaued at 1.4% (95% CI, 0.9 to 1.9) by 10 years post-SCT. The cumulative incidence of developing a solid tumor did not plateau and was 3.8% (95% CI, 2.2 to 5.4) at 20 years post-SCT.

Methylated MP metabolites (formed by thiopurine methyltransferase [TPMT]) and methotrexate (MTX) polyglutamates can inhibit de novo purine synthesis. We explored whether dose adjustment of MP and MTX by erythrocyte (E) levels of TGN and MTX (including polyglutamates) could improve outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 538 children with ALL were randomly assigned to have their oral MP/MTX maintenance therapy adjusted by white cell counts (WBC), E-TGN, and E-MTX (pharmacology group), or by WBC only (control group). RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 7.8 years, 79 patients had relapsed. Cox regression analysis showed an increased risk of relapse for boys (P =.00003), high WBC at diagnosis (P =.03), pharmacology arm (6.6 times increased relapse hazard for girls), high TPMT activity (P =.002), and high average neutrophil counts during maintenance therapy (P =.0009), with a significant interaction between sex and randomization group (P =.0007). For girls, the relapse risk was 5% in the control group and 19% in the pharmacology group (P =.001) because of an increased relapse hazard during the first year after cessation of therapy. TPMT activity was the most significant predictor of relapses among girls in the pharmacology arm (P <.0001). Overall, the TPMT activity was higher for patients who relapsed after cessation of therapy compared with those who stayed in remission (girls 19.5 v 17.4 U/mL, P =.03; boys 19.3 v 18.0 U/mL, P =.04). CONCLUSION: Adding pharmacologically guided treatment intensification to dose adjustments by blood counts may not be warranted for girls, whereas new approaches to optimize maintenance therapy are needed for boys.","['Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Bjork, Olle', 'Glomstein, Anders', 'Gustafsson, Goran', 'Keiding, Niels', 'Kristinsson, Jon', 'Makipernaa, Anne', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Szumlanski, Carol', 'Sorensen, Tine M', 'Weinshilboum, Richard']","['Schmiegelow K', 'Bjork O', 'Glomstein A', 'Gustafsson G', 'Keiding N', 'Kristinsson J', 'Makipernaa A', 'Rosthoj S', 'Szumlanski C', 'Sorensen TM', 'Weinshilboum R']","['Department of Pediatrics, The University Hospital and The University of Copenhagen, Denmark. kschmiegelow@rh.dk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/chemistry', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/blood', 'Neutrophils', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Sex Factors', 'Thioguanine/blood']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.04.039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1332-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.04.039.,"['R01-GM28157/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-GM35720/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, combinations of fludarabine and chlorambucil were abandoned because of increased toxicity from overlapping myelosuppression and immunosuppression. Of the purine analogs active in CLL, pentostatin may be least myelosuppressive. We hypothesized that combining pentostatin with cyclophosphamide would have less myelotoxicity than combinations using other purine analogs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 23 patients with previously treated CLL. All patients received pentostatin 4 mg/m(2). Seventeen patients received cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2), and six patients received cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2). Both drugs were administered on day 1 of each cycle, and cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for six treatments. Filgrastim, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and acyclovir were administered prophylactically. The median number of prior treatment regimens was three (range, one to five) with 13 patients (57%) refractory to prior fludarabine therapy. RESULTS: The cyclophosphamide 900 mg/m(2) dose level was associated with moderate to severe nausea, and we chose cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) as the dose for further study. There were 17 responses (74%; 95% confidence interval, 63% to 85%), including four complete responses. The response rate was 77% in fludarabine-refractory patients. Myelosuppression was acceptable with grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, seen in 35% and 30% of patients, respectively. The relative sparing of thrombopoiesis can be seen in that only one patient (5%) with an initial platelet count of more than 20,000 required platelet transfusions while receiving therapy. CONCLUSION: Pentostatin 4 mg/m(2) with cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m(2) is safe and effective in previously treated patients with CLL. On the basis of these results, we are currently studying pentostatin, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (PCR) therapy in patients with CLL.","['Weiss, Mark A', 'Maslak, Peter G', 'Jurcic, Joseph G', 'Scheinberg, David A', 'Aliff, Timothy B', 'Lamanna, Nicole', 'Frankel, Stanley R', 'Kossman, Steven E', 'Horgan, Denise']","['Weiss MA', 'Maslak PG', 'Jurcic JG', 'Scheinberg DA', 'Aliff TB', 'Lamanna N', 'Frankel SR', 'Kossman SE', 'Horgan D']","['Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021, USA. weissm@mskcc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Pentostatin/*administration & dosage', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.08.100 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1278-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.08.100.,,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study presents the safety data from 349 patients in five studies of outpatient treatment with (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and either 0.4 mCi/kg (15 MBq/kg) or 0.3 mCi/kg (11 MBq/kg) of (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan on day 8 (maximum dose, 32 mCi). Patients were observed for up to 4 years after therapy or until progressive disease. RESULTS: Infusion-related toxicities were typically grade 1 or 2 and were associated with rituximab. No significant organ toxicity was noted. Toxicity was primarily hematologic, with nadir counts occurring at 7 to 9 weeks and lasting approximately 1 to 4 weeks depending on the method of calculation. After the 0.4-mCi/kg dose, grade 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia occurred in 30%, 10%, and 3% of patients, respectively, and after the 0.3-mCi/kg dose, these grade 4 toxicities occurred in 35%, 14%, and 8% of patients, respectively. The risk of hematologic toxicity increased with degree of baseline bone marrow involvement with NHL. Seven percent of patients were hospitalized with infection (3% with neutropenia) and 2% had grade 3 or 4 bleeding events. Myelodysplasia or acute myelogenous leukemia was reported in five patients (1%) 8 to 34 months after treatment. CONCLUSION: Single-dose (90)Y ibritumomab tiuxetan RIT has an acceptable safety profile in relapsed NHL patients with less than 25% lymphoma marrow involvement, adequate marrow reserve, platelets greater than 100,000 cells/ micro L, and neutrophils greater than 1,500 cells/ micro L.","['Witzig, Thomas E', 'White, Christine A', 'Gordon, Leo I', 'Wiseman, Gregory A', 'Emmanouilides, Christos', 'Murray, James L', 'Lister, John', 'Multani, Pratik S']","['Witzig TE', 'White CA', 'Gordon LI', 'Wiseman GA', 'Emmanouilides C', 'Murray JL', 'Lister J', 'Multani PS']","['Division of Internal Medicine and Hematology and the Department of Radiology, Nuclear Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. witzig@mayo.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/toxicity', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/immunology/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/etiology', '*Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects', 'Safety']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.08.043 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1263-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.08.043.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '4Q52C550XK (ibritumomab tiuxetan)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from six Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols that enrolled 1,101 patients with metastatic hormone-refractory adenocarcinoma of the prostate during the study period from 1991 to 2001 were pooled. The proportional hazards model was used to develop a multivariable model on the basis of pretreatment factors and to construct a prognostic model. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was calculated as a measure of predictive discrimination. Calibration of the model predictions was assessed by comparing the predicted probability with the actual survival probability. An independent data set was used to validate the fitted model. RESULTS: The final model included the following factors: lactate dehydrogenase, prostate-specific antigen, alkaline phosphatase, Gleason sum, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, hemoglobin, and the presence of visceral disease. The area under the ROC curve was 0.68. Patients were classified into one of four risk groups. We observed a good agreement between the observed and predicted survival probabilities for the four risk groups. The observed median survival durations were 7.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.2 to 10.9), 13.4 (95% CI, 9.7 to 26.3), 18.9 (95% CI, 16.2 to 26.3), and 27.2 (95% CI, 21.9 to 42.8) months for the first, second, third, and fourth risk groups, respectively. The corresponding median predicted survival times were 8.8, 13.4, 17.4, and 22.80 for the four risk groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six complete NSABP trials have investigated AC regimens (B-15, B-16, B-18, B-22, B-23, and B-25). Six distinct AC regimens have been tested and are distinguished by differences in cyclophosphamide intensity and cumulative dose and by the presence or absence of mandated prophylactic support with growth factor and ciprofloxacin. In all regimens, A was given at 60 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4. C was given as follows: 600 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4 (""standard AC""); 1,200 mg(2) q 21 days x 2; 1,200 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4; 2,400 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 2; and 2,400 mg/m(2) q 21 days x 4. Occurrence of AML/MDS was summarized by incidence per 1,000 patient-years at risk and by cumulative incidence. Rates were compared across regimens, by age, and by treatment with or without breast radiotherapy. RESULTS: The incidence of AML/MDS was sharply elevated in the more intense regimens. In patients receiving two or four cycles of C at 2,400 mg/m(2) with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support, cumulative incidence of AML/MDS at 5 years was 1.01% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63% to 1.62%), compared with 0.21% (95% CI, 0.11% to 0.41%) for patients treated with standard AC. Patients who received breast radiotherapy experienced more secondary AML/MDS than those who did not (RR = 2.38, P=.006), and the data indicated that G-CSF does may possibly also be independently correlated with increased risk. CONCLUSION: AC regimens employing intensified doses of cyclophosphamide requiring G-CSF support were characterized by increased rates of subsequent AML/MDS, although the incidence of AML/MDS was small relative to that of breast cancer relapse. Breast radiotherapy appeared to be associated with an increased risk of AML/MDS.","['Smith, Roy E', 'Bryant, John', 'DeCillis, Arthur', 'Anderson, Stewart']","['Smith RE', 'Bryant J', 'DeCillis A', 'Anderson S']","['National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Operations Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15212-5234, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/adverse effects', 'Ciprofloxacin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*chemically induced', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*chemically induced', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2003.03.114 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2003 Apr 1;21(7):1195-204. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2003.03.114.,"['U10-CA12027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10-CA69651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,['National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Experience'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis of CNL requires the exclusion of BCR/ABL positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and of leukaemoid reactions (LRs). The differentiation between CNL and LR is problematic because both conditions share similar morphological features; it is also important because patients with CNL generally have a poor prognosis. AIMS: To determine whether CNL and LR could be distinguished on the basis of different clonality patterns. METHODS: Blood samples from 52 women were studied using the human androgen receptor gene assay (HUMARA). RESULTS: Monoclonality was found in the neutrophils in all 17 patients with different myeloproliferative syndromes (MPSs), including those with CNL. In four of the patients with CNL, autologous T cells were also monoclonal, suggesting that they belonged to the neoplastic clone. This finding was in contrast to other MPSs in which T cells were almost always polyclonal. Of nine patients with clinically suspected LR, the neutrophils of five were polyclonal, whereas three patients had monoclonal neutrophils, suggesting that they might be in the process of developing an MPS. Among 26 healthy blood donors, 20 had polyclonal neutrophils and five showed skewed clonality patterns. One case of LR and one normal blood donor were scored ""not informative"" at the HUMARA locus. CONCLUSIONS: Clonality studies of blood neutrophils using HUMARA aid in distinguishing female patients with monoclonal CNL from those with LR. For the diagnosis of CNL, monoclonality of the neutrophils should be demonstrated whenever possible.","['Bohm, J', 'Kock, S', 'Schaefer, H E', 'Fisch, P']","['Bohm J', 'Kock S', 'Schaefer HE', 'Fisch P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Freiburg, Medical School, D-79002 Freiburg, Germany. jboehm@ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Leukemoid Reaction/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Neutrophils/pathology', 'Receptors, Androgen/genetics/metabolism']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/06/05 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.56.4.292 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2003 Apr;56(4):292-5. doi: 10.1136/jcp.56.4.292.,,"['0 (Receptors, Androgen)']",,PMC1769920,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the apoptogenic potential of gamma-TQ in cultured human leukemia HL-60 and colon adenocarcinoma WiDr cells, and in murine thymoma cells growing in vivo in ascites form. The cells were treated with gamma-TQ and apoptosis was evaluated morphologically by acridine-orange staining and cytofluorimetrically by Annexin V binding assay. gamma-TQ-induced apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner in all the cell types tested, although HL-60 and thymoma cells were much more sensitive than WiDr cells. In HL-60 cells apoptosis was mediated by the activation of the caspase-3 cascade. In particular, we observed a time- and dose-dependent increase in the activities of the upstream caspase-9 and caspase-8 and of the downstream caspase-3. The activation of caspase-9 preceded that of caspase-8 and its specific inhibition completely prevented apoptosis. These findings and data showing the precocious release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, a decrease in Bcl-2, and a change in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Delta psi(m)), all suggest that the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway is primarily involved in the development of gamma-TQ-induced apoptosis. The late activation of caspase-8 and data showing the partial cleavage of pro-apoptotic protein BID suggest that the initial activation of caspase-9 may be potentiated by a feedback amplification loop involving the caspase-8/BID pathway.","['Calviello, Gabriella', 'Di Nicuolo, Fiorella', 'Piccioni, Elisabetta', 'Marcocci, M Elena', 'Serini, Simona', 'Maggiano, Nicola', 'Jones, Kenneth H', 'Cornwell, David G', 'Palozza, Paola']","['Calviello G', 'Di Nicuolo F', 'Piccioni E', 'Marcocci ME', 'Serini S', 'Maggiano N', 'Jones KH', 'Cornwell DG', 'Palozza P']","['Institutes of General Pathology and Pathology, Catholic University, L.go F.Vito, 1-00168 Rome, Italy. g.calviello@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin E/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/06 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/carcin/24.3.427 [doi]'],ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2003 Mar;24(3):427-33. doi: 10.1093/carcin/24.3.427.,,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '1406-18-4 (Vitamin E)', '7559-04-8 (tocopherylquinone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comparative studies on leukemic cell samples obtained from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients before and after treatment with STI571 reported point mutations in resistant samples after a short time of therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether patients with Ph+ ALL in whom resistance developed as a consequence of the Glu255Lys mutation already harbored this subclone prior to STI571 treatment. First, the migration pattern of cDNAs from 30 bone marrow samples from patients with Ph+ ALL was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP). Thereafter, detailed mutational analysis using genomic DNA was performed on initial STI571-naive bone marrow samples of 4 individuals with Ph+ ALL, for whom the mutation Glu255Lys in association with STI571 treatment had been shown. A 166-bp PCR fragment spanning from nucleotide (nt) 862 to nt 1027 was cloned, and 108 clones per sample were analyzed by direct sequencing. This more sensitive technique revealed the presence of the Glu255Lys mutation in 2 initial samples, one clone each. We identified for the first time the mutation Glu255Lys in STI571-naive leukemic samples of Ph+ ALL patients. The findings suggest that the mutation exists in a very small subpopulation of leukemic cells at the beginning of STI571 therapy.","['Hofmann, Wolf-Karsten', 'Komor, Martina', 'Wassmann, Barbara', 'Jones, Letetia C', 'Gschaidmeier, Harald', 'Hoelzer, Dieter', 'Koeffler, H Phillip', 'Ottmann, Oliver G']","['Hofmann WK', 'Komor M', 'Wassmann B', 'Jones LC', 'Gschaidmeier H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Koeffler HP', 'Ottmann OG']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Theodor-Stern-Kai 7, 60596, Frankfurt/Main, Germany. w.k.hofmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic', 'Clone Cells/enzymology', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', '*Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', '*Point Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Selection, Genetic', 'Time Factors']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-06-1756 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44388-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):659-61. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-06-1756.

Our in silico screening strategy indicated that a hypoxia-inducible proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 gene family called Nix is expressed during erythropoiesis. We next performed Northern blot analyses and determined that the 1.4-kb Nix transcript is expressed at lower levels in erythroleukemia cells than reticulocytes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based transcriptional patterning confirmed the increased expression of Nix during human erythropoiesis with a pattern similar to that of Bcl-xL and glycophorin A and opposite that of Bcl-2. Western blot analyses revealed Nix protein levels that were lower than expected due to increased proteosomal degradation. The expression of Nix and Bcl-xL proteins decreased relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control on the removal of erythropoietin (EPO) from the culture medium. Immunocytochemical analyses demonstrated a similar perinuclear mitochondrial expression pattern for both proteins in hemoglobinized precursors. On the basis of these data, we propose that the proapoptotic factor Nix is a highly regulated effector of growth during terminal erythroid maturation.","['Aerbajinai, Wulin', 'Giattina, Mara', 'Lee, Y Terry', 'Raffeld, Mark', 'Miller, Jeffery L']","['Aerbajinai W', 'Giattina M', 'Lee YT', 'Raffeld M', 'Miller JL']","['Laboratory of Chemical Biology, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/*genetics', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Reticulocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3324 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44395-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):712-7. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3324.

Follow-up data are available on 7 of these 9 patients; all 7 patients achieved improvements in hematologic parameters.

To understand the basis of alloimmune responses against minor H antigens, identification of minor H peptides and their antigenicity-determining mechanisms is essential. Here we report the identification of HA-3 and its encoding gene. The HA-3 peptide, VTEPGTAQY (HA-3T), is encoded by the lymphoid blast crisis (Lbc) oncogene. We thus show for the first time that a leukemia-associated oncogene can give rise to immunogenic T-cell epitopes that may have participated in antihost and antileukemic alloimmune responses. Genotypic analysis of HA-3- individuals revealed the allelic counterpart VMEPGTAQY (HA-3M). Despite the lack of T-cell recognition of HA-3- cells, the Thr-->Met substitution had only a modest effect on peptide binding to HLA-A1 and a minimal impact on recognition by T cells when added exogenously to target cells. This substitution did not influence transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) transport, but, in contrast to the HA-3T peptide, HA-3M is destroyed by proteasome-mediated digestion. Thus, the immunogenicity of minor H antigens can result from proteasome-mediated destruction of the negative allelic peptide.","['Spierings, Eric', 'Brickner, Anthony G', 'Caldwell, Jennifer A', 'Zegveld, Suzanne', 'Tatsis, Nia', 'Blokland, Els', 'Pool, Jos', 'Pierce, Richard A', 'Mollah, Sahana', 'Shabanowitz, Jeffrey', 'Eisenlohr, Laurence C', 'van Veelen, Peter', 'Ossendorp, Ferry', 'Hunt, Donald F', 'Goulmy, Els', 'Engelhard, Victor H']","['Spierings E', 'Brickner AG', 'Caldwell JA', 'Zegveld S', 'Tatsis N', 'Blokland E', 'Pool J', 'Pierce RA', 'Mollah S', 'Shabanowitz J', 'Eisenlohr LC', 'van Veelen P', 'Ossendorp F', 'Hunt DF', 'Goulmy E', 'Engelhard VH']","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['A Kinase Anchor Proteins', 'ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Antigen Presentation', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'HLA-A1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*metabolism', 'Pedigree', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/metabolism', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0260 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44383-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):621-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0260.

However, cytokines may induce, on one hand, survival factor expression and cell proliferation and, on the other hand, expression of inhibitory signals such as up-regulation of suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) and induce apoptotic cell death. Because blasts from patients with AML express high procaspase protein levels, we asked whether granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) enhances procaspase protein production in AML cells. In the GM-CSF-responsive OCIM2 AML cell line, GM-CSF induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat 5) phosphorylation, up-regulated cyclin D2, and stimulated cell cycle progression. Concurrently, GM-CSF stimulated expression of SOCS-2 and -3 and of procaspases 2 and 3 and induced caspase 3 activation, poly(ADP[adenosine 5'-diphosphate]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, and apoptotic cell death. The Janus kinase (Jak)-Stat inhibitor AG490 abrogated GM-CSF-induced expression of procaspase 3 and activation of caspase 3. Under the same conditions GM-CSF up-regulated production of BAX as well as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, survivin, and XIAP. GM-CSF also increased procaspase 3 protein levels in OCI/AML3 and Mo7e cells, suggesting that this phenomenon is not restricted to a single leukemia cell line. Our data suggest that GM-CSF exerts a dual effect: it stimulates cell division but contemporaneously up-regulates Jak-Stat-dependent proapoptotic proteins. Up-regulation of procaspase levels in AML is thus a beacon for an ongoing growth-stimulatory signal.","['Faderl, Stefan', 'Harris, David', 'Van, Quin', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Faderl S', 'Harris D', 'Van Q', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Leukemia,, The University of Texas M.

These patients randomly received (n = 213) or did not receive (n = 212) a 30 mg/kg/day continuous intravenous infusion of quinine in combination with induction chemotherapy combining idarubicine and cytarabine and, depending on bone marrow examination at day 20, an additional course of cytarabine and mitoxantrone. The mean steady-state quinine concentration was 7.8 mg/L and the mean multidrug resistance reversing activity of serum was 1.96. Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 344 patients (80.9%) without significant influence of quinine. Of the patients in complete remission, 82 were assigned to receive HLA-matched bone marrow transplants, whereas 262 were assigned to 2 courses of intensive consolidation chemotherapy, with or without quinine, depending on initial randomization. The 4-year actuarial overall survival (OS) of the 425 eligible patients was 42.0% +/- 2.5%, without significant influence of quinine. Of 160 patients who could be studied, 54 demonstrated rhodamine 123 efflux. In these patients, quinine significantly improved the CR rate from 12 of 25 (48.0%) to 24 of 29 (82.8%) (P =.01). However, there was no significant difference in OS. Neither mdr1 gene nor P-glycoprotein expression influenced the outcome.

Two distinct types of FLT3 mutations are most common: internal tandem duplication (ITD) of sequences coding for the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations at codon 835 (Asp835) within the kinase domain. Both types of mutations constitutively activate the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3 in experimental systems and result in factor-independent proliferation of Ba/F3 and 32D cells. Recently, novel mutations within the activation loop were identified in patients with AML: deletion of isoleucine 836 (Ile836del) and an exchange of isoleucine 836 to methionine plus an arginine insertion (Ile836Met+Arg). To examine whether the Ile836 mutations result in constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor, we introduced both mutant FLT3 cDNAs transiently into HEK 293 cells. Both mutant FLT3 receptors were constitutively autophosphorylated in the absence of ligand and kinase activity led to constitutive activation of downstream signaling cascades as determined by activation of the STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5) pathway. When stably expressed in the growth factor-dependent cell lines Ba/F3 and 32D, both deletion and insertion mutants led to factor-independent proliferation, indicating that both mutants have transforming capabilities. We then examined the sensitivity of the FLT3 ITD, FLT3 Asp835Tyr, and the novel FLT3 receptor mutants toward the kinase inhibitors AG1296, PKC412, and SU5614. We show that these FLT3 kinase inhibitors have distinct inhibitory potencies against different activating FLT3 receptor mutants. These results suggest that it may be useful to determine the exact kind of FLT3 mutation when applying receptor kinase inhibitors in clinical trials.","['Grundler, Rebekka', 'Thiede, Christian', 'Miething, Cornelius', 'Steudel, Christine', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Duyster, Justus']","['Grundler R', 'Thiede C', 'Miething C', 'Steudel C', 'Peschel C', 'Duyster J']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Laboratory of Leukemogenesis, Technical University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line/cytology/enzymology', 'Codon/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/pharmacology', 'Mice', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tyrphostins/*pharmacology', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3441 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44386-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):646-51. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3441.

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the potential genotoxicity of a purified soy unconjugated isoflavone mixture in men with prostate cancer. DESIGN: Twenty patients with prostate cancer were treated with 300 mg genistein/d for 28 d and then with 600 mg/d for another 56 d. In peripheral lymphocytes, DNA strand breaks were assessed as nuclear tail moment, chromosomal damage was assessed as micronucleus frequency (MF), and translocations of the MLL gene (11q23) were assessed by using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Values are also reported for 6 healthy men. The studies were performed under Investigational New Drug application no. 54 137 at a tertiary referral academic medical center. RESULTS: No changes in group average or individual nuclear tail moment and MF were observed. We observed a single elevated MF value in one subject that exceeded a clinical threshold set before we initiated the study. A significant decrease in average COMET tail moment was observed on day 28 relative to day 0. We detected no genistein-induced rearrangements of the MLL gene in the 3 subjects we studied with this technique. MF increased significantly in lymphocytes exposed in vitro to unconjugated genistein at concentrations > or = 100 micromol/L. Total genistein never exceeded a peak concentration of 27.1 micro mol/L, and unconjugated genistein never exceeded a peak concentration of 0.32 micromol/L. CONCLUSION: Although isoflavones are capable of inducing genetic damage in vitro, a similar effect was not observed in subjects treated with a purified soy unconjugated isoflavone mixture.","['Miltyk, Woytek', 'Craciunescu, Corneliu N', 'Fischer, Leslie', 'Jeffcoat, Robert A', 'Koch, Matthew A', 'Lopaczynski, Wlodek', 'Mahoney, Chrysa', 'Jeffcoat, Robert A', 'Crowell, James', 'Paglieri, Jennifer', 'Zeisel, Steven H']","['Miltyk W', 'Craciunescu CN', 'Fischer L', 'Jeffcoat RA', 'Koch MA', 'Lopaczynski W', 'Mahoney C', 'Jeffcoat RA', 'Crowell J', 'Paglieri J', 'Zeisel SH']","['Department of Nutrition, School of Public Health and School of Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599-7400, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Clin Nutr,The American journal of clinical nutrition,0376027,IM,"['Adult', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genistein/adverse effects/blood/therapeutic use', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Isoflavones/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Lymphocytes/chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/ultrastructure', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*drug therapy', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Soybeans/*chemistry', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/04/25 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/25 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcn/77.4.875 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Nutr. 2003 Apr;77(4):875-82. doi: 10.1093/ajcn/77.4.875.,"['CN75035/CN/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56350/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00046/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', '6287WC5J2L (daidzein)', '92M5F28TVF (glycitein)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study explored the mechanisms of resistance to pemetrexed in L1210 murine leukemia cells using chemical mutagenesis with 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (5-formylTHF) as the growth substrate. A cell line, MTA-13, was identified that was 8.5-fold resistant to pemetrexed with comparable cross-resistance to ZD1694 (Tomudex) and lesser cross-resistance (5-fold) to ZD9331 [(2S)-2-(O-fluoro-p-[N-(2,7-dimethyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-quinazolin-6-ylmethyl)-N-( prop-2-ynyl)amino]benzamido)-4-(tetrazol-5-yl)-butyric acid], DDATHF (dideazatetrahydrofolate) (3.5-fold), and methotrexate (MTX) (2.7-fold) but comparable sensitivity to trimetrexate. Influx of pemetrexed, MTX, and 5-formylTHF into MTA-13 cells was decreased by 56, 47, and 38% compared to wild-type cells. Folate receptor expression was negligible in both cell lines. Net drug uptake declined within 15min to a slower, constant rate over the next 45min, reflecting the rate of accumulation of pemetrexed polyglutamate derivatives. This rate in the MTA-13 line was half that of the wild-type cells. Accumulation of 50nM [3H]pemetrexed, 25nM [3H]5-formylTHF, or 50nM [3H]DDATHF after 3 days was decreased to 35, 46, and 56% the level of L1210 cells. The reduced folate carrier (RFC) message and protein were decreased by 50%, and folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) message was decreased by 65% in MTA-13 cells. No mutations were detected in either protein by DNA sequence analysis. There was a slight decrease (approximately 25%) in thymidylate synthase mRNA, without mutations in the protein, and there was no change in GAR transformylase message. The data indicate that resistance to pemetrexed in the MTA-13 cell line was due to changes in both RFC and FPGS expression, two proteins that act in tandem to regulate polyglutamation of folates and antifolates in cells, resulting in cellular depletion of these active pemetrexed congeners.","['Wang, Yanhua', 'Zhao, Rongboa', 'Goldman, I David']","['Wang Y', 'Zhao R', 'Goldman ID']","['Departments of Medicine and Molecular Pharmacology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine Cancer Center, 1300 Morris Park Avenue, Bronx, NY 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Gene Silencing/drug effects', 'Glutamates/*pharmacology', 'Guanine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Mice', 'Pemetrexed', 'Peptide Synthases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase', 'Reduced Folate Carrier Protein', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0006295203000078 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00007-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2003 Apr 1;65(7):1163-70. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(03)00007-8.,['CA 82621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Reduced Folate Carrier Protein)', '0 (Slc19a1 protein, mouse)', '04Q9AIZ7NO (Pemetrexed)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.2.- (Hydroxymethyl and Formyl Transferases)', 'EC 2.1.2.2 (Phosphoribosylglycinamide Formyltransferase)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Peptide Synthases)', 'EC 6.3.2.17 (folylpolyglutamate synthetase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of angiogenesis in growth and survival of neoplastic cells of the hematopoietic system has recently been recognized, and provides a rationale for novel therapeutic approaches to hematological malignancy. This review summarizes the literature concerning the relationship between angiogenesis and disease progression of several hematological malignancies. It is becoming increasingly evident that agents that interfere with blood vessel formation also block tumor progression, and, accordingly, antiangiogenic therapy has gained much interest as a potential adjunct to conventional therapy of many hematological malignancies. Recent successful applications of antiangiogenic agents that interfere or block the progression of hematological malignancies are evaluated in light of recent demonstrations of potent angiogenic activity of several hematopoietic growth factors. A novel finding regarding the role of angiogenesis in hematological malignancies, which accounts for many clinical observations as well as the apparent independence of these tumors on marrow vascularity, is presented. The information presented in this review will facilitate the design of future clinical trials using antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of hematological malignancies and will provide a basis for the design of experiments undertaken to define the mechanisms involved, mechanisms that may shed new light on the pathology of hematological malignancies.","['Ribatti, Domenico', 'Vacca, Angelo', 'Dammacco, Franco', 'English, Denis']","['Ribatti D', 'Vacca A', 'Dammacco F', 'English D']","['Department of Human Anatomy and Histology, University of Bari Medical School, I-70124 Bari, Italy. ribatti@anatomia.uniba.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Hematother Stem Cell Res,Journal of hematotherapy & stem cell research,100892915,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Chick Embryo/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythropoietin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/pathology/therapy', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases/physiology', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Neovascularization, Pathologic', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",97,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/10/24 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/152581603321210091 [doi]'],ppublish,J Hematother Stem Cell Res. 2003 Feb;12(1):11-22. doi: 10.1089/152581603321210091.,['R01 HL61751/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Matrix Metalloproteinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One mechanism often used by cancer cells to escape apoptosis is the overexpression of B cell leukaemia/lymphoma-2 protein (BCL-2) or related antiapoptotic proteins. Inhibiting BCL-2, therefore, is an anticancer strategy worthy of attention. BCL-2 homology 3 (BH3) domains are alpha-helical segments found in BCL-2 family member proteins. In pro-apoptotic members, the BH3 domain is necessary for pro-apoptotic function. It has been shown that short peptides derived from the BH3 region possess intrinsic pro-death activity. Furthermore, certain peptides of this group exert their pro-death function by specifically binding BCL-2 and opposing BCL-2's antideath function. Therefore, BH3 domains are prototype BCL-2 inhibitors.

While the optimal use of the drug in many clinical settings has yet to be clarified, two pivotal trials have established rituximab as a viable treatment option in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent NHL, and as a standard first-line treatment option when combined with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy in elderly patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (the most common type of aggressive NHL). The former was a noncomparative trial in relapsed indolent NHL (follicular and small lymphocytic subtypes) with clinical responses achieved in about half of patients treated with rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously once weekly for 4 weeks, which was similar to some of the most encouraging results reported with traditional chemotherapeutic agents. The latter was a randomised comparison of eight cycles of CHOP plus rituximab 375 mg/m(2) intravenously (one dose per cycle) versus CHOP alone in previously untreated elderly patients (60 to 80 years of age) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. In this pivotal trial, 2-year event-free and overall survival were significantly higher with rituximab plus CHOP, and there was no increase in clinically significant adverse effects compared with CHOP alone. Treatment with rituximab is generally well tolerated, particularly in terms of adverse haematological effects and serious or opportunistic infections relative to standard chemotherapy. Infusion-related reactions occur in the majority of patients treated with rituximab; these are usually mild to moderate flu-like symptoms that decrease in frequency with subsequent infusions. In approximately 10% of patients, however, severe infusion-related reactions develop (e.g. bronchospasm, hypotension). These reactions are usually reversible with appropriate interventions and supportive care but there have been rare reports of fatalities. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical trials with rituximab indicate that the drug has broad application to B-cell malignancies, although further clarification is needed to determine its optimal use in many of these clinical settings. Importantly, rituximab in combination with CHOP chemotherapy has emerged as a new treatment standard for previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, at least in elderly patients. Compared with conventional chemotherapy, rituximab is associated with markedly reduced haematological events such as severe neutropenia, as well as associated infections. Rituximab may be particularly suitable for elderly patients or those with poor performance status, and its tolerability profile facilitates its use in combination with cytotoxic drugs. PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES: Rituximab is a mouse/human chimaeric IgG(1)-kappa monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen found on the surface of malignant and normal B lymphocytes. Although treatment with rituximab induces lymphopenia in most patients, typically lasting about 6 months, a full recovery of B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood is usually seen 9-12 months after therapy, as CD20 is not expressed on haematopoietic stem cells. CD20 is, however, expressed on >90% of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) and to a lesser degree on B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) cells. Although not fully elucidated, the cytotoxic effects of rituximab on CD20-positive malignant B cells appears to involve complement-dependent cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and induction of apoptosis. In addition, in vitro data indicate that rituximab sensitises tumour cells to the effects of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs. PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES: Serum rituximab concentrations increased in proportion to dose across a wide range of single- and multiple-dose intravenous regimens in patients with B-cell NHL. When administll NHL. When administered at a dose of 375 mg/m(2) once weekly for 4 weeks in a pivotal trial in patients with relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell NHL (follicular or small lymphocytic subtypes), peak serum concentrations essentially doubled from the first (239.1 mg/L) to the fourth (460.7 mg/L) infusion, while elimination half-life (t(1/2)) increased from 76.3 to 205.8 hours (3.2 to 8.6 days). The concomitant increase in serum rituximab concentrations and t(1/2) with each successive infusion may be due, at least in part, to the elimination of circulating CD20-positive B cells and reduction or saturation of CD20-binding sites after the initial infusions of rituximab. The pharmacokinetic properties of rituximab are also characterised by wide inter-individual variability, and serum drug concentrations that are correlated with clinical response. Although pharmacokinetic data are limited in patients with aggressive forms of NHL, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, rituximab appears to have a similar pharmacokinetic profile in these patients to that in patients with indolent B-cell NHL. The pharmacokinetics of rituximab are also reported to be similar whether the drug is administered with or without cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy. THERAPEUTIC USE: A number of studies have demonstrated efficacy of intravenous rituximab in patients with various lymphoid malignancies of B-cell origin, including indolent (e.g. follicular lymphoma) and aggressive (e.g. diffuse large B-cell lymphoma) forms of NHL, and CLL, but the drug has not yet been approved for use in CLL, and approved indications in NHL vary between countries. In the US, for example, rituximab is available for the treatment of patients with low-grade or follicular, relapsed or refractory, CD20-positive B-cell NHL. In Europe, the drug has similar approval for relapsed or refractory follicular NHL as in the US, but has also been approved for use in combination with CHOP chemotherapy for the most common aggressive form of NHL (CD20-positive, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma). Rituximab was approved for these indications primarily on the basis of results from two pivotal trials. In Japan, rituximab has been approved for indolent B-cell NHL and mantle cell lymphoma (an aggressive form of B-cell NHL), primarily on the basis of results of a Japanese phase II trial. Indolent NHL: Results of several studies evaluating rituximab 375 mg/m(2) once weekly for 4 weeks in patients with indolent forms of B-cell NHL (primarily follicular and small lymphocytic lymphomas) showed objective response (OR) rates ranging from approximately 40-60% in those receiving the drug for relapsed or refractory indolent B-cell NHL, and slightly higher (50-70%) for those receiving rituximab as first-line therapy. In a pivotal trial in 166 patients with relapsed or refractory low-grade or follicular B-cell NHL, intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed an OR rate of 48%, and a projected median time to progression of 13 months. Encouraging data are also emerging on the use of rituximab in combination with chemotherapeutic agents (e.g. CHOP, fludarabine-containing regimens) or other drugs (e.g. interferon-alpha2a) in previously untreated patients with indolent forms of B-cell NHL (primarily follicular and small lymphocytic subtypes). Rates for OR were consistently around 95%, with the majority being complete responses (CRs). Follow-up data from a study in 40 patients with low-grade or follicular B-cell NHL treated with rituximab plus CHOP as first-line therapy showed that responses were durable with a progression-free survival and median duration of response >5 years.Bcl-2 gene rearrangement (t14;18) occurs in malignant cells in up to 85% of patients with follicular lymphoma, and minimal residual disease in peripheral blood and bone marrow can be monitored using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In several studies assessing blood and/or bone marrow, rituximab has achieved molecular response (conversion from PCR-positive to PCR-negative bcl-2 status) in at least half of the patients. Aggressive NHL: Studies with rituximab as monotherapy in aggressive B-cell NHL, a potentially curable disorder, have generally been restricted to patients with relapsed or recurrent disease, since CHOP has traditionally been the standard first-line treatment regimen. However, promising results from phase II monotherapy studies prompted further clinical investigation of rituximab in conjunction with chemotherapy. Thus, most studies with rituximab in patients with aggressive forms of B-cell NHL have involved combination therapy, including a pivotal randomised trial comparing eight cycles of standard CHOP therapy plus rituximab 375 mg/m(2) (one dose per cycle) versus CHOP alone in 399 previously untreated elderly patients (60-80 years of age) with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Results of the pivotal trial showed a clear advantage for rituximab plus CHOP versus CHOP in terms of event-free survival (primary endpoint) at 2 years (57% vs 38%, p < 0.001). Overall survival at 2 years (70% vs 57%, p < 0.01) and CR rate (76% vs 63%, p < 0.01) were also higher with the rituximab-CHOP combination. Other, smaller trials with rituximab in combination with CHOP or other chemotherapeutic regimens, either as first-line therapy or for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell NHL, have also shown promising results in terms of clinical response rates.CLL: In relatively small trials (n < 40) conducted primarily in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell CLL, rituximab monotherapy (various regimens) achieved OR rates of 23-45%, with median duration of response ranging from approximately 3-10 months.

In the present study, HL-60 cells were used to characterize the apoptotic effects of T-2 and a major metabolite, HT-2, and to examine the mechanisms involved. Apoptotic cells were identified microscopically by chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation, by flow cytometric analysis, and by DNA gel electrophoresis. T-2 and HT-2 induced concentration-dependent apoptosis after 24 h in HL-60 cells, starting at concentrations of 3.1 and 6.25 ng/ml respectively. An increased number of apoptotic cells could be observed 4-6 h after exposure to 12.5 ng/ml of toxin. Little cytotoxicity (plasma membrane damage) was observed even after exposure to concentrations of toxins (25-50 ng/ml) inducing apoptosis in 60-100% of the cells. The apoptotic process was almost completely blocked in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk. In contrast, no or only minor effects were observed with the more specific caspase inhibitors DEVD.CHO, IETD.fmk, and DEVD.fmk. As judged by Western blotting, the levels of several procaspases (-3, -7, -8, -9, but not -12) were reduced 3-6 h after exposure to toxin. Substantial increases in the presumed active form(s) of caspase-8 and -9 were observed. Furthermore, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was already markedly cleaved 3 h after toxin treatment, indicative of active caspase-3 and -7. No or only minor changes in Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bax levels were observed. BAPTA-AM and ZnCl2 blocked the degradation of procaspases, the fragmentation of PARP, and the induction of apoptosis. In summary, both T-2 and HT-2 induced apoptosis, with T-2 being somewhat more potent than HT-2. The divalent calcium concentration, [Ca2+], appears to be involved in the activation of several caspases, resulting in DNA fragmentation, chromosomal condensation, and nuclear fragmentation.","['Holme, J A', 'Morrison, E', 'Samuelsen, J T', 'Wiger, R', 'Lag, M', 'Schwarze, P E', 'Bernhoft, A', 'Refsnes, M']","['Holme JA', 'Morrison E', 'Samuelsen JT', 'Wiger R', 'Lag M', 'Schwarze PE', 'Bernhoft A', 'Refsnes M']","['Division of Environmental Medicine, Norwegian Institute of Public Health, Nydalen, Oslo, Norway. jorn.holme@fhi.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Biol Toxicol,Cell biology and toxicology,8506639,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspases/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'T-2 Toxin/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/09/18 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1022069715399 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Biol Toxicol. 2003 Feb;19(1):53-68. doi: 10.1023/a:1022069715399.,,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'I3FL5NM3MO (T-2 Toxin)', 'NC6C26RM46 (HT-2 toxin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1999)]. As an extension of this study, we demonstrated that human alpha-, epsilon-, and gamma- globin genes were also suppressed by the reduced expression of CP2 in K562 cells. To address how much CP2 contributes in the regulation of globin gene expression, we measured transcriptional activities of the wild type alpha-globin promoter and its various factor-binding sites mutants in erythroid and nonerythroid cells. Interestingly, CP2 site dependent transcriptional activation occurred in an erythroid-cell specific manner, even though CP2 is ubiquitously expressed. In addition, CP2 site mutation within the alpha-promoter severely suppressed promoter activity in differentiated, but not in undifferentiated MEL cells, suggesting that the CP2 binding site is needed for the enhanced transcription of globin genes during erythroid differentiation. When the human beta-globin locus control region was linked to the alpha-promoter, suppression was more severe in the CP2 site mutant in differentiated MEL cells. Overall data indicate that CP2 is a major factor in the regulation of globin expression in human and mouse erythroid cells, and CP2 binding to the globin gene promoter is essential for the enhanced transcription of globin genes in erythroid differentiation.","['Chae, Ji Hyung', 'Kim, Chul Geun']","['Chae JH', 'Kim CG']","['Department of Life Science, Research Institute for Natural Sciences, College of Natural Sciences, Hanyang University, Seoul 133-791, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Mol Cells,Molecules and cells,9610936,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Erythropoiesis/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Globins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Organ Specificity', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/05/02 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Cells. 2003 Feb 28;15(1):40-7.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since [Ru(phen)3]2+ was shown to react with 2'-deoxyguanosine to form the diastereomers of a spiroiminodihydantoin derivative (the product from 1O2 reaction), 1O2 might also be an oxidizing species in the case of Ru-ODN-1 (7) and Ru-ODN-2 (13). Therefore to determine the range of reaction, a series of 'variant' targets was prepared, in which G21 was replaced with a cytosine and a guanine substituted for a base further towards the 3'-end (e.g. Variant 3; 5'T G A C C A T C A A T A A G G A A G A A C C G23 C T T C A G C G G32 C C3'). While it was noted that efficient reaction took place at distances apparently remote from the photosensitiser (e.g at G32, but not G23 for Variant 3), this effect could be attributed to hairpinning of the single-stranded region of the target. These results are therefore consistent with the photooxidative damage being induced by a reaction close to the photosensitiser rather than by a diffusible species such as 1O2.","['Cream, Conor W', 'Kavanagh, Yvonne T', ""O'Keeffe, Clare M"", 'Lawler, Mark P', 'Stevenson, Clarke', 'Davies, R Jeremy H', 'Boyle, Peter H', 'Kelly, John M']","['Cream CW', 'Kavanagh YT', ""O'Keeffe CM"", 'Lawler MP', 'Stevenson C', 'Davies RJ', 'Boyle PH', 'Kelly JM']","['Chemistry Department, Trinity College, University of Dublin, Dublin 2, Ireland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Photochem Photobiol Sci,Photochemical & photobiological sciences : Official journal of the European Photochemistry Association and the European Society for Photobiology,101124451,IM,"['Autoradiography', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Single-Stranded/*chemistry/*radiation effects', 'Densitometry', 'Genes, abl/*genetics/*radiation effects', 'Guanine/chemistry/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*chemistry', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemistry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*chemistry', 'Ruthenium/*chemistry']",,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/04/30 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/30 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/b207387k [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol Sci. 2002 Dec;1(12):1024-33. doi: 10.1039/b207387k.,,"['0 (DNA, Single-Stranded)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment with IFN-alfa can cause (severe) neuropsychiatric side effects. The purpose of this article is to give an updated review of data on the incidence, manifestations and prediction of psychiatric side effects of immunotherapy with IFN-alfa. Furthermore, the article gives an overview of the management strategies and of the various theories on the pathophysiology of behavioural effects induced by cytokines. METHODS: Use was made of computerized searches and of checking cross-references of articles and book chapters. The data on the incidence, manifestations and prediction are arranged by source of information, by target symptoms and by method of ascertainment. RESULTS: Different sources of information exist, e.g. adverse event reports of clinical trials, case descriptions and research specifically targeted on neuropsychiatric side effects. IFN-alfa is capable of inducing depressive symptoms and syndromes; the evidence for the induction of other psychiatric side effects is weaker. The depressive syndromes induced by IFN-alfa are in need of a more precise characterization. The results of studies on prediction of side effects are contradictory. Guidelines on managing psychiatric side effects predominantly arise from practical experience and common sense. Patient education plays a pivotal role. At this moment, there is no comprehensive theory on the pathophysiology of cytokine-induced psychiatric side effects. CONCLUSION: There is sufficient empirical support for a causal relation between IFN-alfa and the development of depressive symptoms and syndromes. Practical management of neuropsychiatric side effects begins before the start of therapy and should consist of repeated patient education, drug treatment and supportive measures. There are diverging theories on the pathophysiological backgrounds.","['Van Gool, Arthur R', 'Kruit, Wim H J', 'Engels, Frederike K', 'Stoter, Gerrit', 'Bannink, Marjolein', 'Eggermont, Alexander M M']","['Van Gool AR', 'Kruit WH', 'Engels FK', 'Stoter G', 'Bannink M', 'Eggermont AM']","['Department of Psychosocial Oncology, Erasmus University Medical Center-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. gool@onch.azr.nl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pharm World Sci,Pharmacy world & science : PWS,9307352,IM,"['Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Depressive Disorder/chemically induced/psychology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Mental Disorders/*chemically induced/psychology', 'Syndrome']",56,2003/03/29 05:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/03/29 05:00'],"['2003/03/29 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/29 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1022449613907 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm World Sci. 2003 Feb;25(1):11-20. doi: 10.1023/a:1022449613907.,,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, more than 15 fusion partners of ETV6 have been characterized at the molecular level. Most of these fusions encode chimeric proteins with oncogenic properties. However, some of the translocations do not produce a functional fusion protein, but may induce ectopic expression of oncogenes located close to the breakpoint. We herein report the characterization and cloning of a novel cryptic translocation, t(12;17)(p13;p12-p13), occurring in a patient with an acute myeloid leukemia evolving from a chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Cytogenetic analysis suggested the presence of a deletion of the short arm of chromosome 12, del(12)(p13), in three of the five metaphase cells analyzed. However, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the ETV6-specific cosmid clones 179A6, 50F4, 163E7, and 148B6 as well as probes hybridizing to the TP53 gene on 17p13 and the subtelomeric region of 17p revealed the presence of a translocation between 12p and 17p. By FISH, the breakpoints could be localized in intron 1 of ETV6 and centromeric to TP53. By 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends-polymerase chain reaction (3' RACE-PCR), a fusion transcript between exon 1 of ETV6 and the antisense strand of PER1 (period homolog 1, Drosophila), a circadian clock gene, could be identified. This ETV6-PER1 (antisense PER1 strand) fusion transcript does not produce a fusion protein, and no other fusion transcripts could be detected. We hypothesize that in the absence of a fusion protein, the inactivation of PER1 or deregulation of a gene in the neighborhood of PER1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukemias with a t(12;17)(p13;p12-p13).","['Murga Penas, Eva Maria', 'Cools, Jan', 'Algenstaedt, Petra', 'Hinz, Kristina', 'Seeger, Doris', 'Schafhausen, Philippe', 'Schilling, Georgia', 'Marynen, Peter', 'Hossfeld, Dieter K', 'Dierlamm, Judith']","['Murga Penas EM', 'Cools J', 'Algenstaedt P', 'Hinz K', 'Seeger D', 'Schafhausen P', 'Schilling G', 'Marynen P', 'Hossfeld DK', 'Dierlamm J']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/*genetics', 'DNA, Antisense/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Period Circadian Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10175 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 May;37(1):79-83. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10175.,,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Antisense)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PER1 protein, human)', '0 (Period Circadian Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gene is mutated in approximately 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB type M2 and occurs in the absence of the t(8;21). In much the same way as specific translocations are associated with a particular AML FAB type, the identification of non-random associations of gene mutation with karyotype or FAB type may be helpful in elucidating the molecular basis of certain forms of leukemia. To confirm these initial findings, 99 patients with AML FAB type M1 or M2 were screened for CEBPA mutations by use of a PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing approach. Nine CEBPA mutations were identified in eight patients. The mutations were clustered toward the COOH terminal of the protein and occurred exclusively in the intermediate cytogenetic risk group (8/64, 12.5%). Two patients with biallelic mutation, one homozygous for 1137Ins (57 bp) and another with two CEBPA mutations, 1096Ins (27 bp) and 363Ins (GGCC), were observed. There was no evidence for deletion of this region in the other six mutated samples analyzed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with a BAC clone spanning the CEBPA locus. CEBPA mutation status was not demonstrated to be of prognostic importance in this patient group, although this may reflect the selection and size of the AML population studied.

The target of these deletions is CDKN2A, a gene encoding both p16(INK4a) and p14(ARF). However, contiguous genes such as CDKN2B, encoding p15(INK4b), or MTAP, encoding methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, can be included in the deletions. Gene dosage by use of real-time PCR has recently been proposed as a promising technical option for the diagnosis of deletions. However, its reliability and its capacity to detect mono-allelic deletions in tumor samples are controversial. To evaluate the frequency and extent of deletions in 284 children with ALL, we devised a real-time PCR assay for CDKN2A, CDKN2B exons 1beta and 3, and MTAP gene dosage and validated it by comparison with loss-of-heterozygosity analysis. We show that, if several controls and adjustments are performed, real-time PCR can provide a reliable test for mono- and bi-allelic deletions in ALL. We propose a strategy that overcomes the major caveats of such a dosage in tumor samples: aneuploidy and contamination by normal cells. By use of this assay, we found bi-allelic deletions in 58 and 17% of T- and B-lineage ALL, respectively. Mono-allelic deletion was observed in about 15% of cases, stressing the importance of their detection in ALL. CDKN2B and/or MTAP co-deletions were highly variable in both T- and B-lineage ALL, making ALL with 9p21 a rather heterogeneous group. Because proteins encoded by these genes might influence the response to treatment, the prognosis of 9p21-deleted ALL could vary according to the extent of the deletion.","['Bertin, Raphaelle', 'Acquaviva, Cecile', 'Mirebeau, Delphine', 'Guidal-Giroux, Christine', 'Vilmer, Etienne', 'Cave, Helene']","['Bertin R', 'Acquaviva C', 'Mirebeau D', 'Guidal-Giroux C', 'Vilmer E', 'Cave H']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie Genetique, Federation de Genetique, Hopital Robert Debre (AP-HP), Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'Computer Systems', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', '*Gene Dosage', '*Genes, p16', 'HeLa Cells/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell', 'Loss of Heterozygosity/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10188 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 May;37(1):44-57. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10188.,,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

About 25% of cALL patients have the TEL-AML1 gene fusion derived from the t(12;21) chromosomal translocation. Recent evidence from retrospective analysis of neonatal blood spots (Guthrie cards) in Europe has demonstrated that this chromosome translocation may arise prenatally. The aim of our study was to determine whether TEL-AML1 fusions arise prenatally in a U.S. population of cALL patients. TEL-AML1-positive cALL cases (n = 14) were identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and the genomic breakpoints were identified by a streamlined long-distance PCR approach and sequenced. Clonotypic primers were designed for each patient breakpoint, and a nested PCR assay was used to determine the presence of the TEL-AML1 fusion sequence in neonatal Guthrie cards. Seven of 14 cases demonstrated clonotypic sequences on the archival Guthrie cards. The oldest patient that was positive was 6.7 years old at the time of diagnosis of leukemia. These results confirm previously published findings of a prenatal origin of TEL-AML1 in Europe by demonstrating its occurrence in a California-born population. Secondary changes were also similar to those described previously, with deletion of the second TEL allele being the most common. Other secondary changes included duplication of the fusion gene, trisomy 21, and monosomy X.","['McHale, Cliona M', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Zhang, Luoping', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Buffler, Patricia A', 'Guo, Weihong', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Smith, Martyn T']","['McHale CM', 'Wiemels JL', 'Zhang L', 'Ma X', 'Buffler PA', 'Guo W', 'Loh ML', 'Smith MT']","['School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley 94720-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Disorders/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'Female', 'Fetal Diseases/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Genetics, Population', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neonatal Screening/methods', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Pregnancy']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.10199 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2003 May;37(1):36-43. doi: 10.1002/gcc.10199.,"['K23-80915/PHS HHS/United States', 'P30 ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the importance of IL-6 for Mcl-1 expression in five MM cell lines and in primary MM cells from 14 patients. While culture of MM.1S cells in IL-6 did induce Mcl-1 expression, four other MM cell lines exhibited high levels of Mcl-1 expression that were unaffected by IL-6. Similarly, Mcl-1 expression in 10 of 14 primary MM isolates was found to be IL-6-independent. An analysis of the mechanisms responsible for IL-6-independent Mcl-1 expression was undertaken. ERK1/2 activity did not influence Mcl-1 expression, distinct from Mcl-1 regulation that occurs during myeloid differentiation from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway led to growth inhibition of 8226 and ANBL-6 cells without reduction of Mcl-1 levels, and high level Mcl-1 expression was maintained in the absence of activated STAT3. Analysis of the transcriptional activity of 5'-regulatory sequences from the human Mcl-1 gene in MM cells demonstrated high levels of IL-6-independent indicator gene activation as predicted. These data demonstrate that the mechanisms regulating Mcl-1 levels in MM cells are heterogeneous, and are often independent from IL-6 signaling pathways.","['Zhang, Bin', 'Potyagaylo, Valeria', 'Fenton, Robert G']","['Zhang B', 'Potyagaylo V', 'Fenton RG']","['University of Maryland Greenebaum Cancer Center, Baltimore 21201, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206358 [doi]', '1206358 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Mar 27;22(12):1848-59. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206358.,,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unexpectedly, both scid and nude mice inoculated with M1- epsilon C cells showed significantly prolonged survival time than those receiving parent M1 cells.

METHODS: In the HCT setting with a follow-up of up to 55 months, we studied the transfer of hepatitis B virus (HBV) specific immunity from electively immunized donors into HLA compatible recipients suffering from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). After excluding preexisting HBV specific immunity in donor-recipient pairs, 27 prospective donors were vaccinated against HBV. In addition, on an average of 22 months postHCT, 8 of the 19 recipients were immunized once for HBV. RESULTS: Donor vaccination resulted in detectable hepatitis B surface (HBs) antibodies in 85% of donors and specific cellular in vitro responses in 77%. Two weeks postHCT, 86 and 67% of the recipients displayed positive humoral and cellular HBV reactions, respectively, which then decreased. Afterwards, HBV immunity reappeared in 83% of the recipients without revaccination. Following a single vaccination in recipients, seven of eight displayed a typical memory response. An HBV specific response was already detectable 1 week after vaccination, approximately 1,300-fold (humoral) and 60-fold (cellular) higher than observed in the corresponding donors after a single immunization. CONCLUSIONS: The ""spontaneous"" recurrence of HBV immunity and the memory response in recipients give evidence for an elective immune transfer (e.g., for viral antigens) by way of allogeneic HCT.","['Lindemann, Monika', 'Barsegian, Vahe', 'Runde, Volker', 'Fiedler, Melanie', 'Heermann, Klaus-Hinrich', 'Schaefer, Ulrich W', 'Roggendorf, Michael', 'Grosse-Wilde, Hans']","['Lindemann M', 'Barsegian V', 'Runde V', 'Fiedler M', 'Heermann KH', 'Schaefer UW', 'Roggendorf M', 'Grosse-Wilde H']","['Institute of Immunology, University Hospital, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Adoptive Transfer', 'Adult', 'Antibodies, Viral/administration & dosage', 'Antibody Formation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hepatitis B/*immunology/*therapy', 'Hepatitis B Vaccines', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/virology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/04/29 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/29 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/01.TP.0000054841.42796.68 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 2003 Mar 27;75(6):833-8. doi: 10.1097/01.TP.0000054841.42796.68.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Hepatitis B Vaccines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sensitive quantitative detection methods are a prerequisite to monitor genetically modified T cells in peripheral blood and tissues to study their involvement in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-induced lesions as well as their disappearance or persistence after ganciclovir (GCV)-induced suicide. We monitored the alloreactivity of HSV-Tk-transduced T cells after BMT by studying their in vivo distribution and quantity in peripheral blood and in tissues in a WAG/Rij into Brown Norway fully mismatched rat allogeneic BMT model. Genetically modified T cells were quantified in blood and tissues by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, immunohistochemical analysis, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. A significant increase in the number of allogeneic HSV-Tk(+) T cells was found in particular in spleen and lymph nodes and large numbers were found in tongue, skin, and intestines. In blood, an increase in HSV-Tk(+) T cells closely preceded clinical symptoms of GVHD.

However, the true probabilistic model underlying gene expression intensity readings is generally not known. Instead, in currently used approaches some simple parametric model is assumed (usually a transformed normal distribution) or the empirical distribution is estimated. However, both these strategies may not be optimal for gene expression data, as the non-parametric approach ignores known structural information whereas the fully parametric models run the risk of misspecification. A further related problem is the choice of a suitable scale for the model (e.g. observed vs. log-scale). RESULTS: Here a simple semi-parametric model for gene expression measurement error is presented. In this approach inference is based an approximate likelihood function (the extended quasi-likelihood). Only partial knowledge about the unknown true distribution is required to construct this function. In case of gene expression this information is available in the form of the postulated (e.g. quadratic) variance structure of the data. As the quasi-likelihood behaves (almost) like a proper likelihood, it allows for the estimation of calibration and variance parameters, and it is also straightforward to obtain corresponding approximate confidence intervals. Unlike most other frameworks, it also allows analysis on any preferred scale, i.e. both on the original linear scale as well as on a transformed scale. It can also be employed in regression approaches to model systematic (e.g. array or dye) effects. CONCLUSIONS: The quasi-likelihood framework provides a simple and versatile approach to analyze gene expression data that does not make any strong distributional assumptions about the underlying error model. For several simulated as well as real data sets it provides a better fit to the data than competing models. In an example it also improved the power of tests to identify differential expression.","['Strimmer, Korbinian']",['Strimmer K'],"['Department of Statistics, University of Munich, Ludwigstrasse 33, D-80539 Munich, Germany. strimmer@stat.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,IM,"['Calibration/standards', 'Computer Simulation/statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Profiling/instrumentation/*statistics & numerical data', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Likelihood Functions', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Research Design/*statistics & numerical data']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2002/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2105-4-10 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2003 Mar 20;4:10. doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-4-10.

As the first step in investigating the mechanism by which ZHX1 acts as a transcriptional repressor, we conducted a search of ZHX1-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system. Nuclear proteins such as ZHX1, transcriptional co-factors and DNA-binding proteins, zyxin, androgen-induced aldose reductase and eleven-nineteen lysine-rich leukaemia gene, as well as some unknown proteins, were cloned. Molecular cloning and determination of the nucleotide sequence of the full-length cDNA encoding a novel protein revealed that it consists of 956 amino acid residues and contains two zinc-finger (Znf) motifs and five homeodomains (HDs) as well as ZHX1. We concluded that the protein forms the ZHX family with ZHX1 and denoted it ZHX3. ZHX3 not only dimerizes with both ZHX1 and ZHX3, but also interacts with the activation domain of the NF-YA. Further analysis revealed that ZHX3 is a ubiquitous transcriptional repressor that is localized in nuclei and functions as a dimer. Lastly, the dimerization domain, the interaction domain with NF-YA, and the repressor domain are mapped to a region including the HD1 region, and two nuclear localization signals are mapped to the N-terminal through Znf1 and the HD2 region, respectively.","['Yamada, Kazuya', 'Kawata, Hiroko', 'Shou, Zhangfei', 'Hirano, Satoko', 'Mizutani, Tetsuya', 'Yazawa, Takashi', 'Sekiguchi, Toshio', 'Yoshino, Miki', 'Kajitani, Takashi', 'Miyamoto, Kaoru']","['Yamada K', 'Kawata H', 'Shou Z', 'Hirano S', 'Mizutani T', 'Yazawa T', 'Sekiguchi T', 'Yoshino M', 'Kajitani T', 'Miyamoto K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Fukui Medical University, and Japan and CREST, Japan Science and Technology, Fukui 910-1193, Japan. kazuya@fmsrsa.fukui-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CCAAT-Binding Factor/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Amplification', 'Homeodomain Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Testis/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Zinc Fingers']",,2003/03/28 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/03/28 05:00'],"['2003/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/02/28 00:00 [revised]', '2002/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/28 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20021866 [doi]', 'BJ20021866 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2003 Jul 1;373(Pt 1):167-78. doi: 10.1042/BJ20021866.,,"['0 (CCAAT-Binding Factor)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NFYA protein, human)', '0 (Nfya protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (ZHX1 protein, human)', '0 (ZHX3 protein, human)']",,PMC1223464,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AB081947', 'GENBANK/AB081948']",,,,,

The therapeutic effect of the P-170 positive expression patients was significantly poorer than that of the negative expression patients (P < 0.01). The expression of MRP was positive in 39 and negative in 33 of the 72 post-chemotherapy acute leukemia patients.

Our self-organizing map analysis completely separated the tumor from the normal expression datasets. Within the 14 different tumor types, classification accuracies on the order of approximately 80% correct were achieved. Nearly perfect classifications were found for leukemia, central nervous system, melanoma, uterine, and lymphoma tumor types, with very poor classifications found for colorectal, ovarian, breast, and lung tumors. Classification results were further analyzed to identify sets of differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal gene expressions and among each tumor class. Within the total pool of 1139 genes most differentially expressed in this dataset, subsets were found that could be vetted according to previously published literature sources to be specific tumor markers. Attempts to classify gene expression datasets from other sources found a wide range of classification accuracies.

Genetic and biochemical data suggest that Ras activation plays a central role in leukemogenic transformation by BCR-ABL. Imatinib (Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL. Although imatinib has shown promise against Ph-positive leukemia in human clinical trials, the emergence of imatinib resistance in patients with acute forms of Ph-positive leukemia has highlighted the need for combination chemotherapy to eradicate this disease. In the present study, combined use of a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, SCH66336 (lonafarnib), with the antileukemic agents imatinib, daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, or etoposide was investigated by cell proliferation assays. The effects of the combination of SCH66336 and imatinib were also investigated by apoptosis assay and colony-forming assay. In proliferation assays with BCR-ABL-expressing cells, combination of SCH66336 with imatinib or cytosine arabinoside showed enhanced antiproliferative activity, whereas combination of SCH66336 with daunorubicin or etoposide demonstrated an antagonistic effect. The combination of imatinib plus SCH66336 more effectively inhibited hematopoietic colony formation by primary human chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. SCH66336 combined with imatinib was shown to induce apoptosis in imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL cells by flow cytometric analysis with an APO2.7 monoclonal antibody. These results indicate that SCH66336 is a promising candidate for use in the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant, Ph-positive leukemia and that the combination of SCH66336 plus imatinib may be useful to circumvent resistance.","['Nakajima, Akihiro', 'Tauchi, Tetsuzo', 'Sumi, Masahiko', 'Bishop, W Robert', 'Ohyashiki, Kazuma']","['Nakajima A', 'Tauchi T', 'Sumi M', 'Bishop WR', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo 160-0023, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,IM,"['Alkyl and Aryl Transferases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzamides', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Farnesyltranstransferase', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage', 'Piperidines/*administration & dosage', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'Transfection', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/27 05:00,2003/12/12 05:00,['2003/03/27 05:00'],"['2003/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.4161/cbt.2.3.390 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Mar;2(3):219-24. doi: 10.4161/cbt.2.3.390.,,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.5.- (Alkyl and Aryl Transferases)', 'EC 2.5.1.29 (Farnesyltranstransferase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'IOW153004F (lonafarnib)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,['Mol Cancer Ther. 2003 Mar;2(3):225-6.

SHP-1 has been proposed as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in lymphoma, leukemia and other cancers, as it functions as an antagonist to the growth-promoting and oncogenic potentials of tyrosine kinase. The decreased levels of SHP-1 protein and SHP-1 mRNA observed in various leukemia and lymphoma cell lines have been attributed to either the methylation of the promoter region of the SHP-1 gene or the post-transcriptional block of SHP-1 protein synthesis. In contrast, SHP-1 protein is normally or over-expressed in some non-lymphocytic cell lines, such as prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and breast cancer cell lines. SHP-1 expression also is decreased in some breast cancer cell lines with negative expression of estrogen receptor as well as some prostate and colorectal cancer cell lines. These data suggest that SHP-1 can play either negative or positive roles in regulating signal transduction pathways. Dysfunction in SHP-1 regulation can cause abnormal cell growth and induce different kinds of cancers. In this paper, we summarize recent studies on the expression and regulation of SHP-1 protein and its pathological function in the development of lymphoma, leukemia and other cancers.","['Wu, Chengyu', 'Sun, Mingzhong', 'Liu, Lijun', 'Zhou, G Wayne']","['Wu C', 'Sun M', 'Liu L', 'Zhou GW']","['Program in Molecular Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, 373 Plantation Street, Worchester, MA 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/*genetics/pathology', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases/*genetics/metabolism']",58,2003/03/27 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/27 05:00'],"['2003/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['S0378111903004001 [pii]', '10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00400-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 2003 Mar 13;306:1-12. doi: 10.1016/s0378-1119(03)00400-1.,['AL45858/PHS HHS/United States'],"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The features and the advantages of this approach, which provides substantially more information than is otherwise available from conventional analysis, are demonstrated in experiments monitoring the effects of the antineoplastic agents cisplatinum (cisP) and camptothecin (CAM) on a variety of cultured cell types, including epithelial cells (SW480; human colon carcinoma), fibroblasts (rat2 and 3T3; normal fibroblast lines), and cells of myeloid origin (CCRF-CEM; human leukemia). The utility of the technique is demonstrated further in a series of experiments with the histidine analogue L-histidinol.

After two autologous stem cell transplantation, the patient reverted to chronic phase with a decrease in the proportion of Ph chromosome-positive cells under imatinib. A second blastic phase occurred 4 months after transplantation, of which the patient died.

To the best of our knowledge, dmin containing amplified bcr-abl gene has never been reported in patients with CML.

Patients were observed during the epidemic season from October 1999 to April 2000, and monitored for side-effects of the vaccine, seroprotection and seroconversion after vaccination. The prevaccination level of immunoglobulins was also determined. Occurrence of influenza episodes was demonstrated with the positive isolation of a viral strain from a pharyngeal swab. RESULTS: No patient had untoward reactions to the vaccine used. Seroconversion and seroprotection were up to the standard established by the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products. Only one patient developed influenza during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccine is effective and well tolerated in patients with CLPD and MM.

A monoclonal antibody against its C-terminal domain inhibits Ins(1,4,5) P (3)-induced Ca(2+) release from ER membrane vesicles of many cell types, and an antisense-mediated knockdown of CHERP in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells greatly impaired Ca(2+) mobilization by thrombin. In the present paper, we explore further CHERP's function in Jurkat T-lymphocytes. Confocal laser immunofluorescence microscopy showed that CHERP was co-localized with the Ins(1,4,5) P (3) receptor throughout the cytoplasmic and perinuclear region, as previously found in HEL cells. Transfection of Jurkat cells with a lac I-regulated mammalian expression vector containing CHERP antisense cDNA caused a knockdown of CHERP and impaired the rise of cytoplasmic Ca(2+) (measured by fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester fluorescence) caused by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and thrombin. A 50% fall of CHERP decreased the PHA-induced rise of the cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), but Ca(2+) influx was unaffected. Greater depletion of CHERP (>70%) did not affect the concentration of Ins(1,4,5) P (3) receptors, but diminished the rise of [Ca(2+)](i) in response to PHA to </=30% of that in control cells, decreased Ca(2+) influx and slowed the initial rate of [Ca(2+)](i) rise caused by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, suggesting there was also some deficit in ER Ca(2+) stores. In CHERP-depleted cells the Ca(2+)-dependent activation and translocation of the key transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) from cytoplasm to nucleus was suppressed. Furthermore, cell proliferation was greatly slowed (as in HEL cells) along with a 60% decrease in cyclin D1, a key regulator of progression through the G(1) phase of the cell cycle. These findings provide further evidence that CHERP is an important component of the ER Ca(2+)-mobilizing system in cells, and its loss impairs Ca(2+)-dependent biochemical pathways and progression through the cell cycle.","[""O'Rourke, Flavia A"", 'LaPlante, Janice M', 'Feinstein, Maurice B']","[""O'Rourke FA"", 'LaPlante JM', 'Feinstein MB']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Connecticut Health Center, Farmington CT 06030, USA. orourke@nso1.uchc.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Signaling/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Fura-2/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Isopropyl Thiogalactoside/pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/27 05:00,2003/10/08 05:00,['2003/03/27 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2003/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/08 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20030013 [doi]', 'BJ20030013 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2003 Jul 1;373(Pt 1):133-43. doi: 10.1042/BJ20030013.,['T32 AG00251/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (CHERP protein, human)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '105344-37-4 (fura-2-am)', '367-93-1 (Isopropyl Thiogalactoside)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'TSN3DL106G (Fura-2)']",,PMC1223463,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review presents findings from recent studies that have explored improved methods for the presentation of tumor-associated antigens and for the restoration of tumor specific immune responses using cytokine therapy. METHODS: A review of human clinical trial research on immune cytokines from 1995 (MEDLINE) to the present was conducted. Particular attention was focused on articles that reported results from Phase II or later clinical studies in patients with malignant disease. RESULTS: The defects in cellular immunity commonly seen in patients with malignancies often are expressed as tumor specific anergy. Reversing patient tolerance to tumor antigens may be accomplished by treatment with immunoregulatory cytokines, such as Flt-3 and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor, that mature and activate dendritic cells. Published clinical studies indicate that granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor stimulates antigen-presenting cells and has promising antitumor activity as an adjunct or as stand-alone therapy for patients with malignant disease, including leukemia, melanoma, breast carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Immune-modulating cytokines may be used alone or in combination with other treatments to help restore immune function, improve response to tumor-associated antigens, and reduce the toxic effects of standard antitumor therapies. The evolving understanding of how dendritic cells regulate immune responses and promising results from published studies of immune-enhancing cytokines in the treatment of patients with malignant disease support the conduct of randomized clinical trials to confirm the clinical benefit of these immunotherapeutic strategies.","['Waller, Edmund K', 'Ernstoff, Marc S']","['Waller EK', 'Ernstoff MS']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA. ewaller@emory.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/*therapeutic use', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunotherapy', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/*therapy', 'Vaccination']",121,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11247 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Apr 1;97(7):1797-809. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11247.,,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11247'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of parenteral-oral outpatient therapy in the management of children with LRFN who were receiving treatment for malignant disease. METHODS: From August 2000 to April 2002, 135 children with a median age of 7.5 years (range, 1.6-15.8 years) who had a total of 177 episodes of LRFN were included in a prospective, randomized, single-institution trial. Children with LRFN received a single dose of ceftriaxone and amikacin and completed a risk-assessment work-up. All patients were discharged immediately and, at 24 hours, were allocated randomly to two groups: Group A (89 episodes) received oral ciprofloxacin, and Group B (88 episodes) received intravenous ceftriaxone. RESULTS: Most patients (61% in Group A and 51% in Group B) were receiving treatment for leukemia (P value not significant [NS]). Twenty-eight children (31%) in Group A and 22 children (25%) in Group B displayed unexplained fever (P value NS). No significant differences in sites of initial infection were found between the two groups. The median duration of neutropenia was 4.2 days and 4.7 days for Group A and Group B, respectively (P value NS); the median duration of fever was 2.3 days and 2.6 days, respectively (P value NS); and the median duration of antibiotic treatment was 4.5 days and 4.8 days, respectively (P value NS). The overall results of the study were excellent. Only four treatment failures in Group A (5%) and 6 treatment failures in Group B (7%) were observed. These patients were readmitted to the hospital and did well with appropriate treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In children with LRFN who are receiving treatment for malignant disease, outpatient oral ciprofloxacin after 24 hours of a single dose of intravenous ceftriaxone and amikacin was as safe and efficacious as parenteral ceftriaxone. Outpatient management and early antibiotic withdrawal were safe for both groups.","['Paganini, Hugo', 'Gomez, Sandra', 'Ruvinsky, Silvina', 'Zubizarreta, Pedro', 'Latella, Antonio', 'Fraquelli, Lidia', 'Iturres, Alejandro Santillan', 'Casimir, Lidia', 'Debbag, Roberto']","['Paganini H', 'Gomez S', 'Ruvinsky S', 'Zubizarreta P', 'Latella A', 'Fraquelli L', 'Iturres AS', 'Casimir L', 'Debbag R']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Epidemiology, Hospital de Pediatria Profesor Dr. Juan P.

The aim of this trial was to compare allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT), high-dose cytarabine (ara-C; HiDAC), and autologous SCT as postremission therapy in patients with de novo AML. METHODS: One hundred twenty patients age </= 60 years with previously untreated AML (non-M3) and a performance status score of </= 2 received induction therapy with 3 days of idarubicin and 7 days of ara-C (IA). Patients in CR received one course of HiDAC. Subsequently, patients age </= 50 years with available HLA-compatible donors were assigned to receive allogeneic SCT; patients with ""favorable"" cytogenetics received a second course of HiDAC; and all others were randomized to a second course of HiDAC or autologous SCT. RESULTS: The IA combination induced CR in 99 patients (82.5%). With a median follow-up of 43 months (range, 18-64 years), the 3-year survival and failure-free survival (FFS) rates were 47% and 45%, respectively. The factors associated with longer survival were those identified for CR (i.e., age and cytogenetics). Forty-nine patients (49%) received the assigned postremission therapy. Fifteen patients underwent allogeneic SCT. Nineteen patients underwent autologous SCT and 15 patients received a second course of HiDAC, after randomization. In the allogeneic SCT group, both the 3-year survival and the FFS rates were 73%. In the autologous SCT and HiDAC groups, the 3-year survival rates were 58% and 46%, respectively (P = 0.80), and the 3-year FFS rates were 42% and 33%, respectively (P = 0.83). CONCLUSIONS: The three postremission treatment groups had comparable survival. Allogeneic SCT is associated with a prolonged FFS.","['Tsimberidou, Apostolia-Maria', 'Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Viniou, Nora', 'Papaioannou, Maria', 'Tiniakou, Maria', 'Marinakis, Theodoros', 'Skandali, Anastasia', 'Sakellari, Ioanna', 'Yataganas, Xenophon']","['Tsimberidou AM', 'Stavroyianni N', 'Viniou N', 'Papaioannou M', 'Tiniakou M', 'Marinakis T', 'Skandali A', 'Sakellari I', 'Yataganas X']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, National University of Athens, Medical School, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, Greece. atsimber@mail.mdanderson.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/04/17 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.11240 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2003 Apr 1;97(7):1721-31. doi: 10.1002/cncr.11240.,,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,['Copyright 2003 American Cancer Society.DOI 10.1002/cncr.11240'],['Hellenic Cooperative Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Phase II study was conducted to evaluate an alternating combination cytotoxic regimen given with rituximab and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in these patients. METHODS: Fludarabine-refractory CLL was defined as failure to respond to most recent prior fludarabine-containing regimen. Patients received up to six cycles of fractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, liposomal daunorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVXD) plus rituximab and GM-CSF alternating with methotrexate and cytarabine plus rituximab and GM-CSF.

RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with RS (n = 30 patients) or refractory CLL (n = 19 patients) were treated on study. Nine patients (18%) achieved a complete remission, and 11 patients achieved a partial remission (22%), for an overall objective response (OR) rate of 41%.

METHODS: Intravenous solutions with alternate doses of sodium (regimen A 70 mEq/l, regimen B 100 mEq/l) were given to 30 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in two courses of HDMTX in a randomized crossover fashion. The plasma MTX concentrations every 24 h from the beginning of MTX administration and the adverse events associated with HDMTX were compared between the two hydration regimens. RESULTS: The plasma MTX concentrations were similar in the two hydration regimens at 24 h (A 50.9+/-7.4 vs B 40.9+/-5.4 microM, means+/- SE, P=0.17), but was significantly lower in regimen B at 48 and 72 h (A 0.65+/-0.17 vs B 0.27+/-0.03 microM, P=0.04; and A 0.14+/-0.03 vs B 0.05+/-0.01 microM, P=0.003). The time during which MTX plasma concentrations exceeded 0.1 microM was significantly longer in regimen A than in regimen B (A 3.83+/-0.18 vs B 3.13+/-0.06 days, P=0.001). The incidences of adverse events were similar between the two regimens ( P=0.78), and severe adverse events were not seen in either regimen.

The objective of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity of ritterazine B to non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and its effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of ritterazine B against PC14 NSCLC cells was investigated using a 4-day MTT assay. Morphological changes in cells after exposure to this compound were evaluated by phase-contrast microscopy. The effects on the cell cycle of HL-60 leukemia cells and PC14 cells were elucidated by flow cytometry and an in vitro CDK/cyclin kinase assay. Induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells was assessed using the TUNEL assay and Hoechst 33342 staining. In addition, molecules involved in apoptosis were evaluated by Western blotting. RESULTS: Ritterazine B exerted strong cytotoxic effects against PC14 cells with a mean GI(50) of 75.1 n M. Cell cycle analysis showed that ritterazine B caused accumulation of HL-60 and PC14 cells at the G2/M checkpoint. Furthermore, ritterazine B-treated HL-60 cells became multinucleated, and at a concentration of 20 n M this resulted in the onset of apoptosis. Neither cleavage of caspase target molecules nor phosphorylation of bcl-2 were observed in ritterazine B-treated HL-60 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that ritterazine B might be a potent inducer of apoptosis acting via a novel antimitotic mechanism.","['Komiya, Takefumi', 'Fusetani, Nobuhiro', 'Matsunaga, Shigeki', 'Kubo, Akihito', 'Kaye, Frederic J', 'Kelley, Michael J', 'Tamura, Kenji', 'Yoshida, Makoto', 'Fukuoka, Masahiro', 'Nakagawa, Kazuhiko']","['Komiya T', 'Fusetani N', 'Matsunaga S', 'Kubo A', 'Kaye FJ', 'Kelley MJ', 'Tamura K', 'Yoshida M', 'Fukuoka M', 'Nakagawa K']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Kinki University School of Medicine, 377-2 Ohnohigashi, 589-8511, Osakasayama City, Osaka, Japan. komiyat@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Phenazines/*pharmacology', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Steroids', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2002/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0558-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Mar;51(3):202-8. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0558-8.

The GRE can mediate gene induction by glucocorticoids, mineral corticoids, progesterone and androgens, and it has been shown that incorporation of a GRE(s) within the LTR can increase the transcriptional activity of retroviral enhancers. We have previously reported an increased early virus replication in male mice compared with female mice when infected with a virus containing the FIS-2 LTR and have proposed that the GRE might contribute to this sex difference. In the present study, we introduced a single point mutation in the GRE and performed comparative studies in NIH 3T3 cells and in young adult male and female NMRI mice. We found that significantly more virus was produced from NIH 3T3 cells infected with wt FIS-2 than from cells infected with the FIS-2 GRE mutant and that this difference was further augmented by glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid antagonist RU486 inhibited virus production in a dose-dependent manner. The wt FIS-2 disseminated significantly faster than the FIS-2 GRE mutant in both male and female mice. There was no significant difference in the dissemination rate between male and female mice infected with the FIS-2 GRE mutant. Hence, the GRE in the FIS-2 LTR is one determinant of the significant sex difference in susceptibility to FIS-2 infection.","['Bruland, Torunn', 'Lavik, Liss Anne S', 'Dai, Hong Yan', 'Dalen, Are']","['Bruland T', 'Lavik LAS', 'Dai HY', 'Dalen A']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, MTFS Olav Kyrresg. 3, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway."", 'St Olavs Hospital HF, Trondheim, Norway.', 'St Olavs Hospital HF, Trondheim, Norway.', 'St Olavs Hospital HF, Trondheim, Norway.', ""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, MTFS Olav Kyrresg. 3, N-7489 Trondheim, Norway.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Susceptibility/virology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics/pathogenicity', 'Glucocorticoids/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hormone Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology/*virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Mutation', 'Response Elements/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Sex Factors', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Tumor Virus Infections/pathology/*virology', 'Virulence', '*Virus Replication/drug effects']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/04/26 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/vir.0.18625-0 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2003 Apr;84(Pt 4):907-916. doi: 10.1099/vir.0.18625-0.,,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Hormone Antagonists)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/vir.0.18625-0 [doi],,

The Tax protein of HTLV-I is essential for cellular transformation as well as viral and cellular gene transactivation. The interaction of Tax with cellular proteins is critical for these functions. We previously isolated and characterized a novel Tax-binding protein, TRX (TAX1BP2), by screening a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. In the present study, we present evidence that the tumour suppressor p53 targets the TRX protein for proteasome degradation. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that p53 enhanced the degradation of TRX protein and reduced the half-life from 2.0 to 0.25 h. p53 mutants R248W and R273H enhance TRX degradation suggesting a transcriptionally independent mechanism.

Polymorphisms in human microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) are associated with an increased risk of developing leukemia, specifically those associated with benzene. This study was designed to investigate the importance of mEH in benzene-induced toxicity. Male and female mEH-deficient (mEH-/-) mice and background mice (129/Sv) were exposed to inhaled benzene (0, 10, 50, or 100 ppm) 5 days/week, 6 h/day, for a two-week duration. Total white blood cell counts and bone marrow cell counts were used to assess hematotoxicity and myelotoxicity. Micronucleated peripheral blood cells were counted to assess genotoxicity, and the p21 mRNA level in bone marrow cells was used as a determinant of the p53-regulated DNA damage response. Male mEH-/- mice did not have any significant hematotoxicity or myelotoxicity at the highest benzene exposure compared to the male 129/Sv mice. Significant hematotoxicity or myelotoxicity did not occur in the female mEH-/- or 129/Sv mice. Male mEH-/- mice were also unresponsive to benzene-induced genotoxicity compared to a significant induction in the male 129/Sv mice. The female mEH-/- and 129/Sv mice were virtually unresponsive to benzene-induced genotoxicity. While p21 mRNA expression was highly induced in male 129/Sv mice after exposure to 100-ppm benzene, no significant alteration was observed in male mEH-/- mice. Likewise, p21 mRNA expression in female mEH-/- mice was not significantly induced upon benzene exposure whereas a significant induction was observed in female 129/Sv mice. Thus mEH appears to be critical in benzene-induced toxicity in male, but not female, mice.","['Bauer, Alison K', 'Faiola, Brenda', 'Abernethy, Diane J', 'Marchan, Rosemarie', 'Pluta, Linda J', 'Wong, Victoria A', 'Gonzalez, Frank J', 'Butterworth, Byron E', 'Borghoff, Susan J', 'Everitt, Jeffrey I', 'Recio, Leslie']","['Bauer AK', 'Faiola B', 'Abernethy DJ', 'Marchan R', 'Pluta LJ', 'Wong VA', 'Gonzalez FJ', 'Butterworth BE', 'Borghoff SJ', 'Everitt JI', 'Recio L']","['CIIT Centers for Health Research, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709, USA. bauer1@niehs.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Toxicol Sci,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,9805461,IM,"['Administration, Inhalation', 'Animals', 'Benzene/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Female', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/*metabolism/pathology', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sex Factors', 'Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/09/27 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/toxsci/kfg024 [doi]', 'kfg024 [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Sci. 2003 Apr;72(2):201-9. doi: 10.1093/toxsci/kfg024.

The current study was designed to investigate the role of signal intensity ratio (SIR) of MR Imaging in the characteristic diagnosis and tumor burden evaluation in leukemia by separately measurement of spinal marrow SIR in LL and ML. METHODS: Spinal marrow in 20 LL patients and 10 ML patients in initial consultant were examined with MR imaging. The diagnosis of leukemia in all the patients was proved by iliac marrow cytological examination. MR imaging of spinal marrow was performed with 0.5T super-conducting system. T1-weighted imaging with spin-echotechniques and T2-weighted imaging with turbo spin-echo techniques were performed. The SIR of spinal marrow to spinal cord in leukemia was calculated on midline sagittal T1-weighted imaging. Meanwhile,peripheral blood routine examination and bone marrow cytological examination was performed. RESULTS: The SIR of spinal marrow in 20 LL patients and 10 ML patients were 0.72+/-0.11 and 0.73+/-0.11, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between LL and ML(P=0.836). The SIR of spinal marrow in LL negatively correlated with the percentage of blast lymphocyte in marrow(r =-0.836,P= 0.000),while the SIR of spinal marrow in ML negatively correlated with the percentage of blast myelocyte in marrow (r=-0.673,P= 0.033). CONCLUSION: The SIR of spinal marrow is limited in the characteristic diagnosis of leukemia because of its inability to differential LL from ML.

This technique accelerates demonstration of anti-tumor drug mechanisms and discovery of new drug targets. This study was designed to investigate the differential gene expression of K562 cells after cytochalasin B treatment using cDNA microarray. METHODS: Restriction display polymerase chain reaction (RD-PCR) products of 277 human genes were spotted on a glass slide in microarray. K562 cells grew in RPMI 1640 medium with 10 microg/ml cytochalasin B. After 24 hours, the total RNA was isolated from K562 cells, and mRNA was purified. Both mRNA from the treated K562 cells and the controlled K562 cells were reversely transcribed into cDNA and labeled with two different fluorescence dyes: Cy5 or Cy3, using a method of restriction digestion and PCR labeling (RD-PCR). The probes were hybridized to the cDNA microarrays. After high-stringent washing,the cDNA microarray was scanned for the fluorescent signals and showed difference between the two cells. RESULTS: Among the 277 target genes, 18 down-regulated genes were identified after cytochalasin B treatment. CONCLUSION: There is a consistent tendency toward lower-expressed genes in partial K562 cells after cytochalasin B treatment. Most down-regulated genes were correlated with cell proliferation, signal transduction, and transcription factor.","['Wei, Min', 'Ma, Wen-Li', 'Song, Yan-Bin', 'Feng, Chun-Qiong', 'Shi, Rong', 'Guo, Qiu-Ye', 'Zheng, Wen-Ling']","['Wei M', 'Ma WL', 'Song YB', 'Feng CQ', 'Shi R', 'Guo QY', 'Zheng WL']","['Institute of Molecular Biology,The First Military Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, P.R.

It is hoped that these data will contribute to the development of appropriate programs to address the challenges faced by these children. PROCEDURE: Between 1994 and 2000, 28 children died after treatment for cancer at Hamamatsu University Hospital, Japan. The circumstances, signs and symptoms at the end of life of these children were analyzed through their medical records. RESULTS: Of the 28 children, the underlying diseases were leukemia/lymphoma (LL group; n=11), brain tumors (BT group; n=7), and other solid tumors (OST group; n=10). Records showed poor appetite (100%), dyspnea (82.1%), pain (75.0%), fatigue (71.4%), nausea/vomiting (57.1%), constipation (46.4%) and diarrhea (21.4%) among these children. Anxiety was reported in 53.6% of the entire group of 28 children; however, no child in the BT group manifested anxiety. However, disturbance of consciousness was reported in all children in the BT group, which was significantly greater than in the other groups. Awareness, fear or acceptance of the imminence of his/her own death as indicated by verbal expression was reported in nine children (32.1%).

METHODS: Between 1994 and 2000, 28 children died after treatment for cancer at Hamamatsu University Hospital. The circumstances of their deaths were analyzed through medical records and interviews with 8 sets of bereaved parents. We compared results of this analysis with our previous data collected from 1978 to 1993. RESULTS: Of the 28 children, 11 had leukemia/lymphoma (LL group) and 17 had solid tumors (ST group). Six children (21.4%), all of whom were in the LL group, died of treatment-related complications. Twenty children (71.4%) died during terminal care: three (27.3%) were in the LL group and 17 (100%) in the ST group. Eleven children (39.3%) received terminal care at home and eight (28.6%) of these died at home. The number of children who received terminal care and died at home had increased in comparison with the previous period. Among problems with terminal care identified by parents were the lack of opportunity for the child to continue with education and an inadequate support system after the child's death. CONCLUSIONS: Some advances in the quality of life of the children were recognized. However, these advances were extended to a greater percentage of children in the ST group than in the LL group.

However, because of a graft-vs.-leukaemia effect, a mild (grade I) aGVHD is desirable. As risk factors predisposing for aGVHD are not necessarily the same in children and adults, we have performed a retrospective analysis of risk factors (RFs) for grade II-IV aGVHD in 258 paediatric patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation at our centre. Thirty-two potential RFs were assessed with univariate analysis in logistic regression. Eleven factors were selected for further evaluation in stepwise elimination multivariate analysis. Three independent RFs were found: (1) donor other than human lekocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling [odds ratio (OR) 6.1, p < 0.001); (2) single drug [cyclosporine A (CsA) or methotrexate (Mtx)] graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis (OR 7.0, p < 0.001); and (3) ABO disparity of any kind (OR 2.4, p = 0.02). The RFs were additive: moderate-to-severe aGVHD was seen in none of the patients without any RFs; in 16% with one RF; in 32% with two RFs and in 67% with all three RFs present. Single drug GVHD prophylaxis (CsA or Mtx), any kind of ABO mismatch, and non-sibling donors are RFs for grade II-IV acute GVHD in paediatric SCT. We encourage the use of combination GVHD prophylaxis in children. ABO mismatch should be considered when choosing between otherwise equally suitable donors.","['Svennilson, Johan', 'Remberger, Mats', 'Ringden, Olle']","['Svennilson J', 'Remberger M', 'Ringden O']","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, and Paediatric Haematology Unit, Huddinge University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. johan.svennilson@klinvet.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology/prevention & control', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/methods', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/09/05 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['030 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1399-3046.2003.00030.x [doi]']",ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2003 Apr;7(2):130-6. doi: 10.1034/j.1399-3046.2003.00030.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present here the molecular analysis of the epidemiology of invasive stomatitis due to Aspergillus flavus in patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: During a 5-year period (1992-1996), six isolates of A. flavus were obtained from leukemic patients with invasive Aspergillus stomatitis. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) with three different PCR primers was carried out to investigate the DNA typing of the isolates. RESULTS: The molecular analysis using RAPD revealed that three isolates of A. flavus obtained in 1992 from three patients were of the same type, whereas each of the isolates from the other three patients had a distinct unique band, resulting in four groups of A. flavus. CONCLUSION: As the three patients with invasive oral aspergillosis detected in 1992 were infected by a single strain of A. flavus, the strain was suspected to have caused a nosocomial outbreak of invasive oral aspergillosis in the hematology unit.","['Myoken, Yoshinari', 'Sugata, Tatsumi', 'Fujita, Yoshinori', 'Kyo, Tai-ichi', 'Fujihara, Megumu', 'Kohara, Tadahiro', 'Katsu, Masakazu', 'Mikami, Yuzuru']","['Myoken Y', 'Sugata T', 'Fujita Y', 'Kyo T', 'Fujihara M', 'Kohara T', 'Katsu M', 'Mikami Y']","['Department of Oral Surgery, Hiroshima Red Cross and Atomic Bomb Survivors Hospital, 1-9-6 Senda-machi, Naka-ku, Hiroshima, Japan. myoken@do5.enjoy.ne.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,J Oral Pathol Med,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,8911934,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aspergillosis/*epidemiology/genetics', 'Aspergillus flavus/classification/*genetics', 'Cross Infection/epidemiology', 'DNA, Fungal/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*microbiology', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Serotyping', 'Stomatitis/epidemiology/*microbiology']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['080 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0714.2003.00080.x [doi]']",ppublish,J Oral Pathol Med. 2003 Apr;32(4):215-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0714.2003.00080.x.,,"['0 (DNA, Fungal)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Membrane depolarization and inhibition of Ca2+ entry reappeared in cells transfected with wild-type gp91phox. These experiments demonstrate that inhibition of Ca2+ entry depends on the presence of a functional NADPH oxidase. The Ca2+ signal induced by stimulation of chemotactic receptors also showed remarkable differences: [Ca2+]ic in the sustained phase was higher in gp91phox-/- than in wild-type cells. Alteration of the Ca2+ signal was reproduced by treating peripheral blood neutrophils with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenylene-iodonium.

These lymphomas may present in the skin, but do not represent a homogeneous group. The new World Health Organization classification of lymphoma/leukaemia recognizes several types of NK/T-cell neoplasm, including blastic NK-cell lymphoma, which characteristically presents with cutaneous lesions. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical, pathological and molecular features in six cases of CD56+ lymphoma with cutaneous presentation. METHODS: The clinical, histopathological and immunophenotypic features of six patients were reviewed. In addition, in situ hybridization (ISH) to identify Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mRNA, and polymerase chain reaction analysis to identify the presence of a clonal population of T cells or B cells were performed on lesional skin. RESULTS: All patients presented with widespread nodules and plaques, which in five cases were a characteristic purple colour. Four patients developed disseminated disease, three with neurological involvement. These four patients died between 14 and 46 months following diagnosis (median 30 months). In four of six cases the histopathological and immunohistological features were in keeping with a blastic NK-cell lymphoma. No clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) or T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement was detected in the four cases consistent with an origin from NK cells. A further case fitted the criteria for an extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type and was also the only case to show evidence of EBV mRNA by ISH. A clonal T-cell population was identified in the final case. This patient also exhibited molecular evidence of a clonal B-cell population and a t(14;18) translocation confirmed by sequence analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that NK-cell lymphomas presenting in the skin are a heterogeneous group, and that in the U.K., blastic NK-cell lymphoma is more common than extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type. These lymphomas pursue an aggressive course, with rapid development of disseminated disease, and resistance to chemotherapy. Detailed immunophenotyping is needed to distinguish the different types. Our molecular data indicate that blastic NK-cell lymphoma cases lack clonal TCR/IgH gene rearrangements consistent with an NK-cell origin. Our ISH findings indicate that EBV plays a pathogenetic role only in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma of nasal type.","['Child, F J', 'Mitchell, T J', 'Whittaker, S J', 'Calonje, E', 'Spittle, M', 'Crocker, J', 'Russell-Jones, R']","['Child FJ', 'Mitchell TJ', 'Whittaker SJ', 'Calonje E', 'Spittle M', 'Crocker J', 'Russell-Jones R']","[""Department of Dermatopathology, St John's Institute of Dermatology, St Thomas' Hospital, London, UK. fionachild@hotmail.com""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Dermatol,The British journal of dermatology,0004041,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'CD56 Antigen/immunology', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', '*Ribosomal Proteins', 'Skin Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,2003/03/26 05:00,2003/05/16 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']","['5227 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05227.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Dermatol. 2003 Mar;148(3):507-15. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05227.x.,,"['0 (CD56 Antigen)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '135844-68-7 (RPL22 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, 1,12-bisethylspermine and bisnaphthalimide (elinafide) are currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of certain cancers. Here, the biological activities of two new groups of polyamine derivative, namely the oxa-polyamines and the bisnaphthalimides, are presented. The most active compounds in the oxa-polyamine and bisnaphthalimido series possessed IC(50) values of 2.93 and 1.38 microM, respectively, against MCF7 cells after 48 h of exposure. The structure-relationship activities of each group of compounds are discussed. Bisnaphthalimido compounds are DNA-binding agents. Addition of the bisnaphthalimides PK3, PK4, PK5, PK6 and PK7, at a concentration of 10 microM, to the calf thymus DNA duplex increased the T (m) of DNA by 11.55+/-0.56, 14.545+/-1.59, 6.23+/-2.45, 12.56+/-1.84 and 16.45+/-0.39 degrees C respectively. With the exception of PK5, all compounds bind to DNA by intercalation as judged by effect of compounds on DNA mobility. Ethidium bromide displacement assay showed that all the compounds have significant affinity for calf thymus DNA (the drug concentration required to reduce the fluorescence of initially DNA-bound ethidium bromide by 50%, C(50), was 1.21-17.33 microM). The order of DNA-binding strength was PK4 > PK3 > PK7 > PK6 > PK5. In HL-60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells, oxa-polyamine and bisnaphthalimido treatment resulted in a decline in cell proliferation and viability. The assays performed suggested that apoptosis was not the principal cell death mechanism involved in oxa-polyamine cytotoxicity. In contrast, HL-60 cell death induced by the bisnaphthalimido series was characterized by early exposure of phosphatidylserine exclusive from membrane damage, elevated caspase-3 activity, increased DNA instability and, ultimately, DNA fragmentation. Thus the principal cytotoxic members of the bisnaphthalimido series appear to induce apoptosis.","['Kong Thoo Lin, P', 'Dance, A M', 'Bestwick, C', 'Milne, L']","['Kong Thoo Lin P', 'Dance AM', 'Bestwick C', 'Milne L']","['The Robert Gordon University, School of Life Sciences, St. Andrew Street, Aberdeen AB25 1HG, Scotland, U.K. p.kong@rgu.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Polyamines/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",23,2003/03/26 05:00,2004/03/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 05:00'],"['2003/03/26 05:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 05:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bst0310407 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2003 Apr;31(2):407-10. doi: 10.1042/bst0310407.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Polyamines)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To assess these 2 cases for involvement of the c-myc gene using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with probes specific for the c-myc and immunoglobulin heavy-chain (IgH) genes. RESULTS: In both cases, conventional cytogenetic analysis demonstrated complex karyotypes, including chromosomal translocations involving 8q24. In case 1, a case of de novo prolymphocytic leukemia, the t(8;14)(q24;q32) was detected. In case 2, a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia in prolymphocytoid transformation, the t(8;22)(q24;q11) was identified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies showed c-myc/IgH fusion signals in case 1, proving the presence of the t(8;14). Split c-myc signals without fusion to IgH were observed in case 2, proving c-myc gene rearrangement and consistent with the t(8;22).

We demonstrate that during apoptosis of different types of tumor cells there is a monomethylation of the nuclear protein HMGA1a that is associated to its previously described hyperphosphorylation/dephosphorylation process. HMGA1a methylation is strictly related to the execution of programmed cell death and is a massive event that involves large amounts of the protein. In some tumor cells, HMGA1a protein is already methylated to an extent that depends on cell type. The degree of methylation in any case definitely increases during apoptosis. In the studied cell systems (human leukaemia, human prostate tumor, and rat thyroid transformed cells) among the low-molecular-mass HMG proteins, only HMGA1a was found to be methylated. A tryptic digestion map of HPLC-purified HMGA1a protein showed that methylation occurs at arginine 25 in the consensus G(24)R(25)G(26) that belongs to one of the DNA-binding AT-hooks of the protein. An increase of HMGA1a methylation could be related to heterochromatin and chromatin remodeling of apoptotic cells.","['Sgarra, Riccardo', 'Diana, Francesca', 'Bellarosa, Cristina', 'Dekleva, Vesna', 'Rustighi, Alessandra', 'Toller, Matteo', 'Manfioletti, Guidalberto', 'Giancotti, Vincenzo']","['Sgarra R', 'Diana F', 'Bellarosa C', 'Dekleva V', 'Rustighi A', 'Toller M', 'Manfioletti G', 'Giancotti V']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica, Biofisica e Chimica delle Macromolecole, Universita di Trieste, via L.

However, the detailed mechanism of how EPO protects erythroid cells from apoptosis is still open to question. To address this problem, we used a human EPO-dependent leukemia cell line UT-7/EPO and normal erythroid progenitor cells. After deprivation of EPO, UT-7/EPO cells underwent apoptosis, accompanied by down-regulation of the Bcl-xL protein. In addition, the cleaved products of caspase-3, p11 and p21, and a few cleaved forms of inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) were detected in these cells. When the cells were pre-treated with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, the ratio of apoptotic cells was significantly reduced, suggesting that EPO protects the UT-7/EPO cells from apoptosis via inhibition of caspase activities. When an MEK 1/2 inhibitor U0126 inhibited activities of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the expression of Bcl-xL protein was down-regulated and subsequently apoptosis was induced. Interestingly, Z-VAD-FMK blocked U0126-induced down-regulation of Bcl-xL protein and apoptosis, strongly suggesting that Bcl-xL expression is regulated by caspases which lies downstream of ERK activation pathway in EPO signaling. Importantly, these findings were also observed in normal erythroid progenitor cells. In conclusion, the activation of ERKs by EPO up-regulates Bcl-xL expression via inhibition of caspase activities, resulting in the protection of erythroid cells from apoptosis.","['Mori, Masaki', 'Uchida, Mie', 'Watanabe, Tomoko', 'Kirito, Keita', 'Hatake, Kiyohiko', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Komatsu, Norio']","['Mori M', 'Uchida M', 'Watanabe T', 'Kirito K', 'Hatake K', 'Ozawa K', 'Komatsu N']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Erythropoietin/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/*physiology', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/drug effects/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/05/31 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/31 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.10245 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2003 May;195(2):290-7. doi: 10.1002/jcp.10245.,,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the lack of data on the use of ATRA at this dosage in children with APL, the study group further decided to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of ATRA in children. PROCEDURE: Twenty-three pharmacokinetic and metabolic profiles of ATRA were studied in 14 children (aged 0.9-18.4 years) with APL. Eleven plasma samples were collected over a period of 8 hr and analyzed for ATRA and its metabolites by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Peak plasma concentrations of ATRA were characterized by wide interpatient variability (range: 28.6-513.0 nM). Compared to adults the same metabolic pathways were observed in children. Even though peak plasma concentrations were in the lower range of those considered effective in vitro, ATRA side effects, notably neurotoxicity, still required dose reduction, treatment break, or drug withdrawal in eight patients. In this small number of patients, neurotoxicity could not be related to age or any specific level of ATRA or metabolites in the plasma. Plasma concentrations of vitamin A, however, were significantly higher in those patients, who developed signs of neurotoxicity (P = 0.03, Mann-Whitney Rank Sum test). CONCLUSIONS: Considering the low plasma concentrations and the persistence of toxicity in spite of dose reduction intermittent dosing schedules might be considered as an alternative to further dose reduction of ATRA in the treatment of APL especially in children, who might be at risk of ATRA-induced neurotoxicity.","['Lanvers, Claudia', 'Reinhardt, Dirk', 'Dubbers, Angelika', 'Wagner-Bohn, Alexandra', 'Creutzig, Ursula', 'Ritter, Joerg', 'Boos, Joachim']","['Lanvers C', 'Reinhardt D', 'Dubbers A', 'Wagner-Bohn A', 'Creutzig U', 'Ritter J', 'Boos J']","[""University Children's Hospital Muenster, Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Albert-Schweitzer-Str. 33, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Retinoids/blood', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mpo.10257 [doi]'],ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 2003 May;40(5):293-301. doi: 10.1002/mpo.10257.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Retinoids)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,"['Copyright 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2004 Apr;42(4):392-3.

We performed a retrospective analysis examining pretransplantation and posttransplantation prognostic factors in 90 patients with Ph+ ALL. The median age of the patients was 33 years, with slightly more than half of the patients (58%) in clinical remission at the time of transplantation. Overall, patients had a nonrelapse mortality rate of 30%, a relapse percentage of 34%, and an estimated 5-year disease-free survival rate of 30%. Pretransplantation risk factors for relapse included the expression of the p190 transcript (relative risk [RR] = 5.1; P =.037), evidence of morphologic disease at the time of transplantation (RR = 3.9; P <.001), and type of donor (RR = 2.5; P =.015), with patients receiving autologous or matched related transplants having the highest risk of relapse. The detection of minimal residual disease by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for bcr-abl transcripts was a significant posttransplantation risk factor for relapse (RR = 4.4; P =.001), with posttransplantation patients expressing the p190 transcript having the highest risk of relapse (RR = 8.7; P =.0001). In addition, patients with chronic extensive graft-versus-host disease showed a significantly lower risk of relapse (RR = 0.33; P =.038). Thus, these findings indicate that several pretransplantation and posttransplantation risk factors exist for patients with Ph+ ALL. Together, these factors can be used to improve our risk stratification of patients with Ph+ ALL who undergo transplantation, which will greatly enhance our ability to counsel these patients and potentially lead to the development of more specific treatment plans for them.","['Stirewalt, Derek L', 'Guthrie, Katherine A', 'Beppu, Lan', 'Bryant, Eileen M', 'Doney, Kris', 'Gooley, Ted', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Stirewalt DL', 'Guthrie KA', 'Beppu L', 'Bryant EM', 'Doney K', 'Gooley T', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Radich JP']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Division of Oncology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98109, USA. dstirewa@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*mortality/therapy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/bbmt.2003.50025 [doi]', 'S1083879103000612 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Mar;9(3):206-12. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2003.50025.,"['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA92405-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,['Copyright 2003 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood stem cells were mobilized after cytosine arabinoside of 2 g/m(2) every 12 hours x 8 doses with etoposide of 40 mg/kg total dose infused over 4 days, followed by growth factor support. The preparative regimen included Busulfan of 1 mg/kg orally every 6 hours x 16 doses, followed by etoposide of 60 mg/kg x 1 day (the patient with chronic myeloid leukemia received cyclophosphamide of 60 mg/kg/d x 2 days in lieu of etoposide). PBPCs purged with 4HC were infused following this induction. Toxicities included grade 3 or 4 skin rashes, stomatitis/mucositis, and delay in time to hematopoietic recovery. The maximum tolerated dose of 4HC used to purge PBPCs in this trial was 20 microg/mL, which resulted in an average of 18 days for white blood cells and 28 days for platelet recovery. With a median follow-up of 2.25 years in surviving patients, the 3-year disease free survival rate is 44% and the overall survival rate is 89%. These data suggest that autologous PBPCs are more sensitive than marrow purged with 4HC, tolerating less intense purging, although a survival advantage may still be seen and should be assessed in larger studies. Approaches to minimize stomatitis and protect normal stem cells from the toxicity of 4HC may improve the tolerance and efficacy of this approach.","['Rizzieri, David A', 'Talbot, Jeffrey T', 'Long, Gwynn D', 'Vredenburgh, James J', 'Gasparetto, Christina', 'Smith, Clayton S', 'Colvin, Michael O', 'Adams, David', 'Morris, Ashley', 'Dodge, Richard', 'Loftis, Jennifer', 'Waters-Pick, Barbara', 'Reese, Melissa', 'Carawan, Helen', 'Koh, Liang Piu', 'Chao, Nelson J']","['Rizzieri DA', 'Talbot JT', 'Long GD', 'Vredenburgh JJ', 'Gasparetto C', 'Smith CS', 'Colvin MO', 'Adams D', 'Morris A', 'Dodge R', 'Loftis J', 'Waters-Pick B', 'Reese M', 'Carawan H', 'Koh LP', 'Chao NJ']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA. rizz003@mc.duke.edu']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/*administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Cells, Circulating/*drug effects', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/mortality', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/12/06 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/06 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1053/bbmt.2003.50011 [doi]', 'S1083879102000149 [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2003 Mar;9(3):183-8. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2003.50011.,,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,['Copyright 2003 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The focus of this report is a phase II trial evaluating the efficacy of single-agent rituximab as first-line therapy in patients with indolent lymphoma and scheduled maintenance treatment in prolonging duration of remission. Patients received a 4-week course of standard rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously weekly x 4). Those achieving objective response or stable disease then received maintenance courses of standard rituximab every 6 months, for a maximum of four rituximab courses. Of 62 patients entered in the trial, 61% had follicular lymphoma while 39% had small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). At 6 weeks, 28 of 60 evaluable patients (47%) had an objective response. The response rate improved to 73% (37% complete response) following maintenance rituximab therapy and was similar in patients with follicular lymphoma and SLL (76% v 70%, respectively). Median progression-free survival for the entire group was 34 months. Single-agent therapy was well tolerated and maintenance rituximab was administered without grade 3/4 toxicity. Because of the higher activity of rituximab in this study compared with previous results in patients with relapsed or refractory SLL, a second phase II trial of identical design but limited to patients with SLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia was initiated. Forty-four patients entered this second trial and, at present, 27 continue to receive maintenance courses of rituximab. The current response rate is 56% (8% complete responses). In summary, rituximab appears highly active as first-line single-agent therapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and responses may be improved with maintenance courses of rituximab. Results suggest a higher response rate to rituximab when used as first-line compared with second/third-line treatment, particularly in the subset of patients with SLL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

In this study, we performed gene expression profiling on B cells obtained from 10 healthy age-matched individuals and CLL B cells from 38 B-CLL patients to identify key genetic differences between CLL and normal B cells. In addition, we leveraged recent independent studies to assess the reproducibility of our molecular B-CLL signature. We used a novel combination of several methods of data analysis including our own software and identified 70 previously unreported genes that differentiate leukemic cells from normal B cells, as well as confirmed recently reported B-CLL specific expression levels of an additional 10 genes. Importantly, many of these genes have previously been linked with other cancers, thus lending further support to their importance as candidate genes leading to B-CLL pathogenesis. We have also validated a subset of these genes using independent methodologies. Moreover, we show that our genes can be used to create a diagnostics signature that performs with perfect sensitivity and specificity in an independent cohort of 21 B-CLL and 20 normal subjects, thus strongly validating the informative nature of our set of genes.

However, molecular diagnostics based on microarray data presents major challenges due to the overwhelming number of variables and the complex, multiclass nature of tumor samples. Thus, the development of marker selection methods, that allow the identification of those genes that are most likely to confer high classification accuracy of multiple tumor types, and of multiclass classification schemes is of paramount importance. RESULTS: A computational procedure for marker identification and for classification of multiclass gene expression data through the application of disjoint principal component models is described. The identified features represent a rational and dimensionally reduced base for understanding the basic biology of diseases, defining targets for therapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for the identification and classification of multiple pathological states. The method has been tested on different microarray data sets obtained from various human tumor samples. The results demonstrate that this procedure allows the identification of specific phenotype markers and can classify previously unseen instances in the presence of multiple classes.","['Bicciato, S', 'Luchini, A', 'Di Bello, C']","['Bicciato S', 'Luchini A', 'Di Bello C']","['Department of Chemical Process Engineering, University of Padova, via Marzolo, 9, 35131, Padova, Italy. silvio.bicciato@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', '*Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/classification/*genetics', 'Neuroblastoma/classification/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/genetics', 'Principal Component Analysis/*methods', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/classification/genetics', 'Sarcoma, Ewing/classification/genetics']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/btg051 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Mar 22;19(5):571-8. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg051.,,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One feature of microarray studies is the fact that the number n of samples collected is relatively small compared to the number p of genes per sample which are usually in the thousands. In statistical terms this very large number of predictors compared to a small number of samples or observations makes the classification problem difficult. An efficient way to solve this problem is by using dimension reduction statistical techniques in conjunction with nonparametric discriminant procedures. RESULTS: We view the classification problem as a regression problem with few observations and many predictor variables. We use an adaptive dimension reduction method for generalized semi-parametric regression models that allows us to solve the 'curse of dimensionality problem' arising in the context of expression data. The predictive performance of the resulting classification rule is illustrated on two well know data sets in the microarray literature: the leukemia data that is known to contain classes that are easy 'separable' and the colon data set.","['Antoniadis, A', 'Lambert-Lacroix, S', 'Leblanc, F']","['Antoniadis A', 'Lambert-Lacroix S', 'Leblanc F']","['Laboratoire IMAG-LMC, University Joseph Fourier, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble Cedex 9, France. anestis.antoniadis@imag.fr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Colonic Neoplasms/classification/genetics', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Pattern Recognition, Automated', 'Sample Size']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/btg062 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2003 Mar 22;19(5):563-70. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btg062.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although CAFdA is structurally similar to the clinically established analogs fludarabine and cladribine (CdA), its metabolism and mechanism of actions are significantly different. The present study investigates the in vitro cytotoxicity of CAFdA and CdA in mononuclear cells isolated from 52 patients with chronic lymphocytic (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DESIGN AND METHODS: We incubated the leukemic cells with drugs for 48 hours and cytotoxicity was then evaluated by the MTT dye assay. We also determined the levels of deoxycytidine and deoxyguanosine kinase with radio-chemical substrate-based assays and used a high performance liquid chromatographic method to measure cellular nucleotides in leukemia cells after 2 hours' incubation. RESULTS: Using equimolar concentrations of CAFdA and CdA, the in vitro cytotoxicity for the population was significantly higher with CAFdA than with CdA (median EC50 for CAFdA 0.12 microM and for CdA 0.15 microM, p<0.001). From the individual estimates the difference in cytotoxicity between CAFdA and CdA was more pronounced in cells from CLL patients (median EC50 for CAFdA 0.08 microM and for CdA 0.16 microM p<0.001) than in those from AML patients. We also found that CAFdA was phosphorylated more efficiently than CdA. No correlations were detected in this study between the levels of CdA and CAFdA nucleotides, enzymes levels and the in vitro responses. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The greater in vitro cytotoxicity and cell metabolism of CAFdA compared to CdA confirm the high activity of CAFdA and encourage clinical trials with CAFdA in leukemic patients.","['Lindemalm, Synnove', 'Liliemark, Jan', 'Gruber, Astrid', 'Eriksson, Staffan', 'Karlsson, Mats O', 'Wang, Yuying', 'Albertioni, Freidoun']","['Lindemalm S', 'Liliemark J', 'Gruber A', 'Eriksson S', 'Karlsson MO', 'Wang Y', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adenine Nucleotides', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Arabinonucleosides/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cladribine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Clofarabine', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Mar;88(3):324-32.,,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '47M74X9YT5 (Cladribine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the results of ASCT in a group of 49 patients >= 60 years of age [32 males, median age 63 years (range, 60 to 71)] autografted in our institution from January 1995 to December 2001. DESIGN AND METHODS: There were 27 patients with multiple myeloma, 13 with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 3 with acute myelogenous leukemia, 3 with chronic myelogenous leukemia and 3 with other hematological malignancies. The Karnofsky score was >= 80% in 47 cases. The median time from diagnosis to ASCT was 12 months (range, 5 to 61). Twenty-four patients were autografted in an early disease phase and 25 (51%) in an advanced phase. Peripheral blood stem cells were used in 46 patients (94%), bone marrow in one (2%) and bone marrow plus peripheral blood in two (4%). Forty-one patients received chemotherapy-only conditioning regimens, while only 8 patients received total body irradiation. RESULTS: Engraftment occurred in all but one patient. The median times to achieve a sustained absolute neutrophil count > 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a sustained platelet count >20 x 10(9)/L were 13 (range, 10 to 35) and 13 days (range, 8 to 62), respectively.

Towards a risk-oriented therapy.,290-9,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although chemotherapy in childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has improved in the last decade, except for a group of better-risk patients (approximately one third), more than half the other patients relapse. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the results obtained with bone marrow transplants, either allogeneic (allo-BMT) or autologous (auto-BMT), following two intensive consolidation courses in a series of children with high-risk (HR) AML according to morphologic and early-response BFM criteria. A second objective was to compare the results of auto-BMT with those of allo-BMT. DESIGN AND METHODS: From April 1988 to May 2001, 79 children (< 15 years old) with de novo AML entered the prospective AML-88 trial in a single institution: 50 (63%) were qualified as having high-risk disease and are the subject of this study. After 1 or 2 induction courses, depending on early response, and two consolidations, patients with an HLA-identical sibling received an allo-BMT and all the others an auto-BMT. The conditioning regimen was cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation (TBI) in children over 3 years old and busulfan and etoposide in younger children. Bone marrow was purged with mafosfamide in auto-BMT and cyclosporine alone was given as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis in allo-BMT. RESULTS: At the end of the chemotherapy phase (induction and consolidation ), 46 of the 50 HR patients (92%) had attained complete remission (CR) after one (n=29), two (n=11) or three (n=6) courses; 2 more were in partial remission (PR) and 2 had died. The 48 patients in CR or PR received either an allo-BMT (17) or an auto-BMT (31). Hematologic reconstitution was significantly slower in auto-BMT recipients. Forty-one percent of patients who received allo-BMT suffered acute GVHD grades II-IV. Toxic deaths and relapse rates were 5.9% and 17.6%, respectively, in allo-BMT and 3.2% and 25.8%, respectively, in auto-BMT. Post-transplant 8-year event-free survival (EFS) was 74.5% (54-96) in allo-BMT and 74.2% (59-89) in auto-BMT. EFS and OS in all the series (50 patients) were 71% (59-83) and 73% (61-85), respectively, with a median follow-up of 7.2 years. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that improved results in children with HR-AML can be obtained by either allo- or auto-BMT performed after two courses of intensive consolidation therapy provided good supportive therapy is given and reduced transplant -related mortality (TRM) is minimized.","['Ortega, Juan J', 'Diaz de Heredia, Cristina', 'Olive, Teresa', 'Bastida, Pilar', 'Llort, Anna', 'Armadans, Lluis', 'Torrabadella, Marta', 'Massuet, Lluis']","['Ortega JJ', 'Diaz de Heredia C', 'Olive T', 'Bastida P', 'Llort A', 'Armadans L', 'Torrabadella M', 'Massuet L']","[""Servicio de Hematologia y Oncologia, Area Infantil, Hospital Universitari Vall d'Hebron, Passeig Vall d'Hebron 119, 08035 Barcelona, Spain. jortega.hmi@cs.vhebron.es""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Quality of Life', 'Risk', 'Transplantation, Autologous/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/mortality', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Mar;88(3):290-9.,,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These considerations strengthen the need for rapid identification of the abnormalities. Our aim was to demonstrate whether a modified multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) system might be successfully used to screen a large number of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study we adapted the multiplex RT-PCR assay, previously described by Pallisgaard et al., to detect all the most frequent genetic lesions with their characteristic splicing variants occurring in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, such as the MLL/AF4, MLL/ENL, BCR/ABL p190 (e1a2) and p210 (b2a2,b3a2) isoforms, E2A/PBX1, TEL/AML1, SIL/TAL1 and the novel NUP98/RAP1GDS1 transcript, recently described in a T-ALL leukemic subtype. RESULTS: We used the multiplex RT-PCR assay to screen 170 ALL patients (70 children and 100 adults). PCR positivity was detected in 67 (39%) of the 170 ALL patients studied. The comparison between cytogenetic and molecular analyses showed complete correspondence between the two assays in all patients with an evaluable karyotype. Finally, the observed incidence of genetic lesions in our ALL patients was similar to the frequency usually reported both in children and in adults with ALL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results show that, compared to single RT-PCR reactions, our multiplex RT-PCR system allows rapid, specific, simultaneous as well as a less expensive, laborious and time-consuming detection of the most frequent fusion transcripts in ALL patients. Therefore, it might be recommended for rapid diagnostic molecular screening of large numbers of patients, such as those enrolled in multicenter, co-operative studies. Furthermore, we have shown that multiplex RT-PCR is an open system that can easily be adapted to detect new leukemic genes.","['Elia, Loredana', 'Mancini, Marco', 'Moleti, Luisa', 'Meloni, Giovanna', 'Buffolino, Sonia', 'Krampera, Mauro', 'De Rossi, Giulio', 'Foa, Robin', 'Cimino, Giuseppe']","['Elia L', 'Mancini M', 'Moleti L', 'Meloni G', 'Buffolino S', 'Krampera M', 'De Rossi G', 'Foa R', 'Cimino G']","['Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Cellulari ed Ematologia, Sezione di Ematologia, University La Sapienza, via Benevento 6, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/07/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2003 Mar;88(3):275-9.,,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The available data on the incidence and prognostic significance of clonal immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) gene rearrangements in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are rather contradictory. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and prognostic significance of RAG-1 and -2 mRNA transcripts and clonal IgH gene rearrangements in a cohort of uniformly treated AML patients; the available literature is also reviewed. DESIGN AND METHODS: The study was performed on 76 AML patients, newly diagnosed between August 1996 and November 1999. RAG-1/-2 gene expression was analyzed by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique and IgH gene rearrangements were detected with variable region (VH) family-specific and consensus framework region (FWR)-2 and/or-3 primers. Statistical associations were explored between IgH monoclonality/ RAG mRNA expression and: (i) age, gender, FAB subtype, immunophenotype, cytogenetic risk groups; (ii) response variables (response/relapse incidence, survival). RESULTS: In total, 38/75 samples (50.6%) were RAG-1 and/or -2 positive; 30/76 samples (39.5%) carried clonal IgH genes, whereas 13/30 IgH-positive samples (43.3%) were RAG-1/2-negative. Significant associations were detected only for RAG-2 positivity and unfavorable karyotype and IgH monoclonality and FAB subtypes M4/ M5; no association was identified with response outcome and survival. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Lymphoid-specific molecular markers are detected in a significant proportion of AML patients, regardless of differentiation status (assessed morphologically/ immunophenotypically); however, in our experience, they do not seem to constitute an adverse prognostic factor.","['Stavroyianni, Niki', 'Belessi, Chrysoula', 'Stamatopoulos, Kostas', 'Kosmas, Christos', 'Paterakis, George', 'Abazis, Danae', 'Pangalos, Constantinos', 'Yataganas, Xenophon']","['Stavroyianni N', 'Belessi C', 'Stamatopoulos K', 'Kosmas C', 'Paterakis G', 'Abazis D', 'Pangalos C', 'Yataganas X']","['P.O.

Therefore, to investigate whether CE as an isolated event increases the risk of disease progression during imatinib treatment, we compared the outcome of patients with CML in chronic phase (CML-CP) who developed CE whilst in complete hematologic remission with the outcome of comparable patients in complete hematologic remission who showed no evidence of CE. DESIGN AND METHODS: We serially studied cytogenetic findings in 102 patients receiving the Abl-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib mesylate, as sole agent to treat CML-CP who had no evidence of CE before initiation of imatinib treatment. RESULTS: CE was identified during treatment with imatinib in 15 patients, 10 of whom were in complete hematologic remission. In most cases these changes occurred exclusively in the Ph+ population but in three patients additional changes occurred in a co-existing Ph-negative population. Patients with de novo CE in the absence of any other sign of disease progression had a significantly higher incidence of progression by 18 months than did non-CE patients (progression-free survival 34.3% (CI 10.5-69.8%) vs. 94.1% (CI 80.6-98.4%), p<0.0001).

Recent data revealed immunosuppressive characteristics and substantial haematopoietic stem cell toxicity after repeated dosing of mice. Therefore, treosulfan is considered to be an alternative conditioning agent to busulfan (for example) administered prior to allogeneic/autologous stem cell transplantation of patients with haematological malignancies. An antineoplastic activity for treosulfan has been previously shown in preclinical models of melanoma, breast, lung and renal-cell carcinomas. Here, in vivo antileukaemic activity of treosulfan is compared with the activity of equitoxic doses of cyclophosphamide or busulfan for the first time using human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)-models of paediatric origin xenotransplanted into non-obese diabetic (NOD)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Treosulfan treatment achieved an optimum treated to control (T/C) value of 159% (survival time) against B-ALL-SCID 7 and a T/C value of 0% (tumour growth) against T-ALL-SCID 4 and proB-ALL-SCID 19, respectively. Complete regression of established subcutaneously (s.c.) growing nodules of ALL-SCID 4 and 19 was obvious and long-term survivors without tumour re-growth were observed. Equitoxic doses of busulfan (ALL-SCID 4, 7, 19) or cyclophosphamide (ALL-SCID 19) were less effective with regard to the numbers of complete regressions and the number of cured animals. Side-effects included myelotoxicity and a small reduction in body weight, but these were tolerable.

During T cell development, Notch signalling is required for commitment of the earliest progenitor, and may also function during other developmental stages. T cell commitment from a common lymphoid progenitor occurs at the expense of B cell development, suggesting that Notch signalling inhibits the earliest stage of B lymphopoiesis. In contrast, recent evidence suggests that Notch promotes the development of marginal zone lymphocytes. Not only is Notch required for later stages of B cell development, but several viral proteins appear to utilize Notch signalling in B cells to mediate their functions. In this review, we will focus on potential roles of Notch signalling in B lymphopoiesis and also consider how viral proteins may utilize Notch signalling in B cells.","['He, Yiping', 'Pear, Warren S']","['He Y', 'Pear WS']","['Department of Pathology, Institute for Medicine and Engineering, Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, University of Pennsylvania, 611 BRB II/III, 421 Curie Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19104-3111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Semin Cell Dev Biol,Seminars in cell & developmental biology,9607332,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Receptors, Notch', '*Signal Transduction/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/immunology', 'Viral Proteins/immunology']",70,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['S1084-9521(02)00182-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s1084-9521(02)00182-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Cell Dev Biol. 2003 Apr;14(2):135-42. doi: 10.1016/s1084-9521(02)00182-9.,,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When combined, the data on the alleles of LT-alpha and MCP-1, HTLV-I carriers having high producer alleles of both genes showed a trend for increased provirus load.

In contrast, U937 cells exposed to sodium azide showed an immediate, steep decrease in extracellular acidification rate that was reversible upon azide withdrawal. K562 cells required a >20-fold higher dose of camptothecin to promote similar changes in the extracellular acidification rate, with a corresponding resistance in their susceptibility to camptothecin- or taxol-induced apoptosis. The data show that irreversible commitment to apoptosis is associated with rapid metabolic changes that are reflected by decreased extracellular acidification rate and regulated by the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter.

Many attempts have been made to develop in vitro sensitization tests that employ DCs derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC-DC) or CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+ HPC) purified from cord blood or bone marrow. However, the use of the DCs in in vitro methods has been difficult due to the nature of these cells such as low levels in the source and/or donor-to-donor variability. In our studies, we employed the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, in order to avoid some of these difficulties. At the start, we examined whether treatment of the cells with various cytokines could produce DCs from THP-1. Treatment of THP-1 cells with cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL-4, TNF-alpha, and/or PMA did induce some phenotypic changes in THP-1 cells that were characteristic of DCs. Subsequently, responses to a known sensitizer, dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB), and a non-sensitizer, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), on the expression of co-stimulatory molecules, CD54 and CD86, were examined between the naive cells and the cytokine-treated cells. Interestingly, the naive THP-1 cells responded only to DNCB and the response to the sensitizer was more distinct than cytokine-treated THP-1 cells. Similar phenomena were also observed in the human myeloid leukemia cell line, KG-1. Furthermore, with treatment of DNCB, naive THP-1 cells showed augmented expression of HLA, CD80 and secretion of IL-1 beta. The response of THP-1 cells to a sensitizer was similar to that of LCs/DCs. Upon demonstrating the differentiation of monocyte cells in our system, we then evaluated a series of chemicals, including known sensitizers and non-sensitizers, for their potential to augment CD54 and CD86 expression on naive THP-1 cells. Indeed, known sensitizers such as PPD and 2-MBT significantly augmented CD54 and CD86 expression in a dose-dependent manner while non-sensitizers, such as SLS and methyl salicylate (MS), did not. To note, the metal allergens such as (NH(4))(2)[PtCl(4)], NiSO(4) and CoSO(4) augmented significantly only CD54 expression. Taking advantage of a cultured cell line, measurement of the co-stimulatory molecules, CD54 and CD86, on naive THP-1 cells following chemical exposure shows promise for the development of a simple, short-term in vitro sensitization test.","['Yoshida, Y', 'Sakaguchi, H', 'Ito, Y', 'Okuda, M', 'Suzuki, H']","['Yoshida Y', 'Sakaguchi H', 'Ito Y', 'Okuda M', 'Suzuki H']","['Safety and Microbial Control Research Center, Kao Corporation, 2606 Akabane Ichikai-Machi Haga-Gun, Tochigi 321-3497, Japan. yoshida.yukiko@kao.co.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'B7-1 Antigen/biosynthesis/immunology', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Biological Factors/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Irritants/toxicity', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Monocytes/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Skin Irritancy Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0887233303000067 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00006-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2003 Apr;17(2):221-8. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(03)00006-7.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (Biological Factors)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Irritants)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Thirty-five children and adolescents with ALL, aged 2.4-17.4 y, were fasted for up to 16 h during MT. Nineteen of the children developed hypoglycaemia after 11 to 16 h of fasting. Blood samples for determination of metabolic changes were taken on completion of fasting. Nineteen patients underwent a glucagon stimulation test after 4 to 16 h of fasting during MT. Erythrocyte concentrations of the metabolites of methotrexate (E-MTX) and 6-mercaptopurine (E-TGN) were measured at the time of fasting. Fifteen out of 19 patients who became hypoglycaemic were re-studied 3 to 4 mo after cessation of therapy. RESULTS: In the hypoglycaemia group, plasma levels of gluconeogenic amino acids alanine and glutamine were lower (medians 117 vs 190 micromol L(-1), p = 0.009, and medians 396 vs 448 micromol L(-1), p = 0.031, respectively) than in the normoglycaemia group. Serum levels of free carnitine were lower (medians 20.3 vs 29.8 micromol L(-1), p = 0.027), free fatty acids higher (medians 3.09 vs 1.23 mmol L(-1), p < 0.001) and marked dicarboxylic aciduria was more common in the patients with hypoglycaemia (in 14/16 vs in 2/14, p < 0.001). Impaired responses to glucagon stimulation occurred in 36% (4/11) in the hypoglycaemia group and in 12.5% (1/8) in the normoglycaemia group (p = 0.243). No significant differences were detected in E-MTX and E-TGN between the groups. Most of the metabolic abnormalities returned to normal after cessation of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of gluconeogenic amino acids, especially of alanine, are associated with hypoglycaemia. Reduced hepatic glycogen stores may also be involved in the aetiology.","['Halonen, P', 'Salo, M K', 'Schmiegelow, K', 'Makipernaa, A']","['Halonen P', 'Salo MK', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Makipernaa A']","['Paediatric Research Centre, Medical School, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland. paivi.halonen@kotiposti.net']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alanine/blood', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Blood Glucose', 'Carnitine/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glutamine/blood', 'Humans', 'Hypoglycemia/blood/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",,2003/03/26 04:00,2003/06/20 05:00,['2003/03/26 04:00'],"['2003/03/26 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/26 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00466.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2003;92(1):37-42. doi: 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2003.tb00466.x.,,"['0 (Blood Glucose)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)', 'S7UI8SM58A (Carnitine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents currently under active investigation include derivatives of vitamin D, modeled on its physiological hormone form, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1,25D(3)), but the calcemic effects of these compounds preclude their use in the clinic. An approach that may obviate this problem is to combine 1,25D(3) or its derivatives with other agents that increase the antineoplastic effects of low, nontoxic concentrations of vitamin D compounds. We have recently used the plant-derived polyphenolic antioxidant, carnosic acid (CA), to demonstrate an increase in the differentiating action of 1,25D(3) on human leukemia cells under these conditions (M. Danilenko et al., JNCI, 93: 1224-1233, 2001). We now show that treatment of HL60-G cells with either CA or 1,25D(3) alone resulted in a decrease in the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, the combination of 10 micro M CA and a low concentration of 1,25D(3) (1 nM) produced an enhanced antioxidant effect, which correlated with the potentiation of monocytic differentiation. Other plant antioxidants tested (curcumin, silibinin, and the organoselenium antioxidant ebselen) also potentiated differentiation induced by 1,25D(3), although alone, they had only minor differentiating effects. Differentiation induced by CA/1,25D(3) combinations was associated with increased intracellular glutathione content, whereas buthionine sulfoxime decreased both differentiation and the cellular glutathione content. This combination also enhanced the activation of the Raf-mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase module and increased the binding of the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor to its cognate DNA element in the promoter regions of vitamin D receptor gene, suggesting that the mechanism of potentiation is at least in part attributable to induction and activation of components of this mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Cell treatment with a high concentration of 1,25D(3) (100 nM) resulted in a substantial elevation of basal intracellular calcium concentration. In contrast, importantly for an eventual clinical application of these studies, the potentiating action of CA on differentiation induced by a low concentration of 1,25D(3) (1 nM) was not accompanied by an elevation of basal intracellular calcium concentration. These findings suggest that combinations of CA with derivatives of vitamin D should be evaluated for use in differentiation therapy of myeloid leukemias.","['Danilenko, Michael', 'Wang, Qing', 'Wang, Xuening', 'Levy, Joseph', 'Sharoni, Yoav', 'Studzinski, George P']","['Danilenko M', 'Wang Q', 'Wang X', 'Levy J', 'Sharoni Y', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, 84105, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Abietanes', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Calcitriol/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Diterpenes/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/physiology']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Mar 15;63(6):1325-32.,['CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we tested whether the chemoprotection conferred by expression of the tyrosine-22 variant DHFR could be used for more effective therapy of the 32Dp210 murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Administration of the maximum tolerated dose of trimetrexate (TMTX) with the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose-5'-monophosphate (NBMPR-P) inhibited 32Dp210 tumor progression in mice engrafted with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow and improved survival of tumor-bearing animals as long as drug administration was continued. NBMPR-P coadministration was necessary for maximal tumor inhibition, as administration of TMTX alone delayed but did not prevent tumor progression. The chemoprotection afforded by engraftment with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow was necessary for effective chemotherapy, as normal mice lacking transgenic marrow could not tolerate the higher TMTX dose (60 mg/kg/day) administered to mice with transgenic marrow, and the decreased dose of TMTX with NBMPR-P tolerated by normal tumor-bearing animals did not inhibit tumor progression or improve animal survival. We conclude that TMTX with NBMPR-P inhibits tumor progression in the 32Dp210 model of CML in animals engrafted with drug-resistant tyrosine-22 DHFR transgenic marrow, and that based on this model the introduction of a drug-resistant DHFR gene into marrow combined with TMTX and NBMPR-P administration may provide an effective treatment for CML.","['Sweeney, Colin L', 'Frandsen, Joel L', 'Verfaillie, Catherine M', 'McIvor, R Scott']","['Sweeney CL', 'Frandsen JL', 'Verfaillie CM', 'McIvor RS']","['Gene Therapy Program, Institute of Human Genetics, Department of Genetics, Cell Biology, and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Thioinosine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Thionucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Trimetrexate/administration & dosage/*pharmacology']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Mar 15;63(6):1304-10.,"['CA60803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74887/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '46S541971T (Thioinosine)', ""65199-10-2 (nitrobenzylthioinosine 5'-monophosphate)"", 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'UPN4ITI8T4 (Trimetrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, correlations of apoptosis-regulating proteins with clinical outcome in cancer patients are variable, presumably reflecting the difficulty of using static tests of gene expression in a scenario influenced by a dynamic interplay of multiple pro- and antiapoptotic molecules. Therefore, we assessed the functional integrity of apoptosis pathways in intact primary leukemia cells and correlated the functional status of these pathways with clinical outcome. Active apoptogenic proteins were introduced into primary leukemia cells by electroporation followed by measurement of active caspases by flow cytometric techniques. Cytochrome c was introduced to activate the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway, whereas caspase-8 was introduced to activate the extrinsic (death receptor) pathway. In a series of 24 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, 79% had a block in at least one pathway, indicating that defects in caspase activation mechanisms are common in patients with leukemia. Simultaneous blocks in both pathways correlated with chemoresistant disease (92% of patients with chemoresistant disease versus 33% of patients with chemosensitive disease; P = 0.005) and decreased overall patient survival (35% versus 89% 1-year survival; P = 0.02). Simultaneous blockage of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways could be explained by a defect located at a point of convergence of the two pathways, probably related to overexpression of endogenous inhibitors of the effector-caspases, rather than decreased levels of these proteases. This study supports the importance of apoptosis pathways in determining response to chemotherapy and suggests that functional defects in caspase activation are prognostic in patients with leukemia.","['Schimmer, Aaron D', 'Pedersen, Irene Munk', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Eksioglu-Demiralp, Emel', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Pinto, Ryan', 'Mah, Ken', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Kim, Youngsoo', 'Suh, Won Suk', 'Reed, John C']","['Schimmer AD', 'Pedersen IM', 'Kitada S', 'Eksioglu-Demiralp E', 'Minden MD', 'Pinto R', 'Mah K', 'Andreeff M', 'Kim Y', 'Suh WS', 'Reed JC']","['The Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*administration & dosage/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/*administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electroporation', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Granzymes', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Ovalbumin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Serine Endopeptidases/administration & dosage']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/04/12 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/12 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2003 Mar 15;63(6):1242-8.,['P01 CA55164-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (fluorescein-ovalbumin)', '9006-59-1 (Ovalbumin)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (GZMB protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Granzymes)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients receiving more than percentile 75 (p75) of CD34+ cells reached complete chimerism in T lymphocytes by days 21 to 28, compared with 44% among those receiving p75 or fewer cells (P =.046). Overall, 30.3% patients developed grade 2 to 4 acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). Among 83 evaluable patients, 55.8% developed chronic GVHD (cGVHD). The dose of CD34+ cells infused did influence the development of cGVHD, with a cumulative incidence of extensive cGVHD of 74% vs 47% (P =.02) among patients receiving more than p75 CD34+ cells vs those receiving p75 or fewer. Projected overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) at 43 months were 60% and 46%, respectively. Neither the dose of CD34+ cells nor the dose of CD3+ cells infused significantly influenced OS and EFS, although among patients categorized as high-risk, 36% of those receiving p75 or fewer CD34+ cells relapsed or progressed, compared with only 9% among those receiving more than p75 CD34+ cells (P =.07). Among patients receiving p75 or fewer CD34+ cells, 36% of high-risk patients relapsed, compared with 10% of low- and intermediate-risk patients (P =.004), while relapse rates were not significantly different between both subgroups when we infused more than p75 CD34+ cells, thus indicating that infusing high doses of CD34+ cells ameliorates the negative effect of advanced disease status at transplantation. cGVHD was associated with better EFS (63% vs 16% at 43 months for patients with and without cGVHD; P <.0001) and better OS (78% vs 28% for patients with and without cGHVD; P <.001).

In a transwell coculture system, we observed that myeloma cells up-regulated the Ang-1 receptor Tie2 in human BM endothelial cells. Moreover, in an experimental model of angiogenesis, the conditioned medium of HMCLs significantly stimulated vessel formation compared with control or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. The presence of anti-Tie2 blocking antibody completely blunted the proangiogenic effect of XG-6.

Late-generation LVs transduced efficiently nonproliferating T cells that had progressed from G0 to the G1 phase of the cell cycle on cytokine treatment. Importantly, IL-2 and IL-7, but not IL-15, stimulation preserved physiologic CD4/CD8 and naive-memory ratios in transduced cells with only minor induction of some activation markers. Functional analysis of immune response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) showed that, although CMV-specific T cells were preserved by all conditions of transduction, proliferation and specific killing of autologous cells presenting a CMV epitope were higher for IL-2 and IL-7 than for IL-15. Thus, LV transduction of IL-2 or IL-7 prestimulated cells overcomes the limitations of retroviral vectors and may significantly improve the efficacy of T-cell-based gene therapy.","['Cavalieri, Simona', 'Cazzaniga, Sabrina', 'Geuna, Massimo', 'Magnani, Zulma', 'Bordignon, Claudio', 'Naldini, Luigi', 'Bonini, Chiara']","['Cavalieri S', 'Cazzaniga S', 'Geuna M', 'Magnani Z', 'Bordignon C', 'Naldini L', 'Bonini C']","['Institute for Cancer Research and Treatment, University of Torino Medical School, Cadiolo Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunocompetence', 'Interferon-gamma/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-15/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Lentivirus/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology/virology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', '*Transduction, Genetic']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2003-01-0297 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44364-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):497-505. doi: 10.1182/blood-2003-01-0297.

We sought to determine the relationship of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, inhibition of histone deacetylase, and apoptosis observed in CLL cells to justify a pharmacodynamic end point in these clinical trials. We demonstrate that in vitro depsipeptide induces histone H3 and H4 acetylation and histone deacetylase enzyme inhibition at concentrations corresponding to the LC50 (concentration producing 50% cell death) for cultured CLL cells (0.038 microM depsipeptide). The changes in histone acetylation are lysine specific, involving H4 K5, H4 K12, and H3 K9, and to a lesser extent H4 K8, but not H4 K16 or H3 K14. Depsipeptide-induced apoptosis is caspase dependent, selectively involving the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor (extrinsic pathway) initiating caspase 8 and effector caspase 3. Activation of caspase 8 was accompanied by the down-regulation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP, I-FLICE) without evidence of Fas (CD95) up-regulation. Changes in other apoptotic proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, Mcl-1, and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP), were not observed. Our results demonstrate a relationship between target enzyme inhibition of histone deacetylase, histone H3 and H4 acetylation, and apoptosis involving the TNF-receptor pathway of apoptosis that is not used by other therapeutic agents in CLL. These data suggest use of histone H3 and H4 acetylation, inhibition of histone deacetylase, and down-regulation of FLIP as pharmacodynamic end points for further evaluation of this drug in patients.","['Aron, Jennifer L', 'Parthun, Mark R', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Kitada, Shinichi', 'Mone, Andrew P', 'Davis, Melanie E', 'Shen, Tiansheng', 'Murphy, Timothy', 'Wickham, Joseph', 'Kanakry, Chris', 'Lucas, David M', 'Reed, John C', 'Grever, Michael R', 'Byrd, John C']","['Aron JL', 'Parthun MR', 'Marcucci G', 'Kitada S', 'Mone AP', 'Davis ME', 'Shen T', 'Murphy T', 'Wickham J', 'Kanakry C', 'Lucas DM', 'Reed JC', 'Grever MR', 'Byrd JC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acetylation/drug effects', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'CASP8 and FADD-Like Apoptosis Regulating Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/*physiology', '*Depsipeptides', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', '*Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/*pharmacology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-12-3794 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44387-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):652-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-12-3794.

We evaluated the efficacy of MEDI-507 (a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD2) alone and in combination with humanized anti-Tac (HAT) directed toward CD25, the interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL-2Ralpha) using a human adult T-cell leukemia xenograft model. Weekly treatments (4) with HAT significantly prolonged the survival of the ATL-bearing mice when compared with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated controls (P <.0001). Mice treated with MEDI-507 (100 microg/wk for 4 weeks) survived longer than those treated with HAT (P <.0025). Furthermore, prolonged treatment (6 months) of ATL with MEDI-507 significantly improved the outcome when compared with a short course (4 weeks) of therapy (P <.0036). Such treatment with weekly MEDI-507 for 6 months led to a prolonged survival of the ATL-bearing mice that was comparable with the survival observed in the control group of mice that did not receive a tumor or therapeutic agent. We also found that the expression of Fcgamma receptors (FcRgamma) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes was required for MEDI-507-mediated tumor killing in vivo. Thus, the tumor-killing mechanism with MEDI-507 in vivo required the expression of the receptor FcRgammaIII on polymorphonuclear leukocytes and monocytes, suggesting that it is mediated by a form of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. These results demonstrate that MEDI-507 has therapeutic efficacy on ATL in vivo and provides support for a clinical trial involving this monoclonal antibody in the treatment of patients with CD2-expressing leukemias and lymphomas.","['Zhang, Zhuo', 'Zhang, Meili', 'Ravetch, Jeffrey V', 'Goldman, Carolyn', 'Waldmann, Thomas A']","['Zhang Z', 'Zhang M', 'Ravetch JV', 'Goldman C', 'Waldmann TA']","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute/NIH, Bldg 10, Rm 4N115, 10 Center Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892-1374, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'CD2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, IgG/genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin/immunology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/08/20 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/20 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3601 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)54006-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 1;102(1):284-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3601.

Recently, acquired mutations in exon 2 of GATA1, an X-linked gene encoding a transcription factor that promotes megakaryocytic differentiation, were described in 6 DS patients with AMKL. The mutations prevent the synthesis of the full-length GATA1, but allow the synthesis of a shorter GATA1 protein (GATA1s) that lacks the transactivation domain. To test whether mutated GATA1 is involved in the initiation of clonal megakaryoblastic proliferation or in the progression to AMKL, we screened 35 DS patients with either AMKL or TMD and 7 non-DS children with AMKL for mutations in exon 2 of GATA1. Mutations were identified in 16 of 18 DS patients with AMKL, in 16 of 17 DS patients with TMD, and in 2 identical twins with AMKL and acquired trisomy 21. Analysis revealed various types of mutations in GATA1, including deletion/insertions, splice mutations, and nonsense and missense point mutations, all of which prevent the generation of full-length GATA1, but preserve the translation of GATA1s. We also show that the likely mechanism of generation of GATA1 isoforms is alternative splicing of exon 2 rather than, or in addition to, alternative translation initiation, as was proposed before. These findings suggest that acquired intrauterine inactivating mutations in GATA1 and generation of GATA1s cooperate frequently with trisomy 21 in initiating megakaryoblastic proliferation, but are insufficient for progression to AMKL.","['Rainis, Liat', 'Bercovich, Dan', 'Strehl, Sabine', 'Teigler-Schlegel, Andrea', 'Stark, Batia', 'Trka, Jan', 'Amariglio, Ninette', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Muler, Inna', 'Rechavi, Gideon', 'Kempski, Helena', 'Haas, Oskar A', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Rainis L', 'Bercovich D', 'Strehl S', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Stark B', 'Trka J', 'Amariglio N', 'Biondi A', 'Muler I', 'Rechavi G', 'Kempski H', 'Haas OA', 'Izraeli S']","[""Department of Pediatric Hemato-Oncology, Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel 52621.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/complications/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Female', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/etiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/etiology/*genetics', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Trisomy']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3599 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)50578-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Aug 1;102(3):981-6. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3599.

However, studies of this AML subtype have been hampered by the few number of patients reported, frequently collectively considered with those with AML carrying the t(8;21) translocation. We performed a retrospective study in 110 patients with inv(16)/t(16;16) AML (median age, 34 years) prospectively enrolled in 6 trials conducted in France between 1987 and 1998, with the aim to investigate prognostic factors for complete remission (CR) achievement and outcome of CR patients in this AML subtype. CR rate was 93%. Bad-prognosis factors for CR achievement were higher white blood cell count (WBC) and lower platelet count (optimal cutpoints at 120 and 30 x 109/L, respectively). At 3 years, estimated overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and cumulative incidence of relapse were 58%, 48%, and 42%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, (1) advanced age (optimal cutpoint, 35 years) was the only factor for shorter DFS and (2) advanced age and low platelet count were the 2 factors for shorter survival of CR patients. Outcome of CR patients (1) was not influenced by WBC and cytogenetic findings and (2) was similar among patients allocated to receive allogeneic transplantation, high-dose, or intermediate-dose cytarabine. Interestingly, advanced age was associated with a trend for more frequent additional chromosome abnormalities and predictive of higher cumulative incidence of relapse rather than death in first CR. These results markedly contrast with those reported in patients with t(8;21) AML in whom WBC, and not age, was the main high-risk factor for relapse, DFS, and survival.","['Delaunay, Jacques', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Leblanc, Thierry', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Rigal-Huguet, Francoise', 'Witz, Francis', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Auvrignon, Anne', 'Blaise, Didier', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Mugneret, Francine', 'Bastard, Christian', 'Dastugue, Nicole', 'Van den Akker, Jacqueline', 'Fiere, Denis', 'Reiffers, Josy', 'Castaigne, Sylvie', 'Leverger, Guy', 'Harousseau, Jean-Luc', 'Dombret, Herve']","['Delaunay J', 'Vey N', 'Leblanc T', 'Fenaux P', 'Rigal-Huguet F', 'Witz F', 'Lamy T', 'Auvrignon A', 'Blaise D', 'Pigneux A', 'Mugneret F', 'Bastard C', 'Dastugue N', 'Van den Akker J', 'Fiere D', 'Reiffers J', 'Castaigne S', 'Leverger G', 'Harousseau JL', 'Dombret H']","['Departement of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/*ultrastructure', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/*mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Multicenter Studies as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",44,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/13 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood-2002-11-3527 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)44359-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2003 Jul 15;102(2):462-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2002-11-3527.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight cancer registries in the UK, covering more than half the population, provided data based on >1.5 million cases of cancer. Total prevalence was calculated using methods developed for the EUROPREVAL study, based on modelling incidence and survival trends. The prevalence of cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast (in females), cervix uteri, corpus uteri and prostate, melanoma of skin, Hodgkin's disease, leukaemia and all malignant neoplasms combined, was estimated for the UK for the end of 1992. RESULTS: Overall, approximately 1.5% of males and 2.5% of females in the UK population at the end of 1992 were living with a diagnosis of cancer. These proportions increased steeply with age, with approximately 7.5% (7.3% and 7.8%, in males and females, respectively) of people aged > or =65 years living with a diagnosis of cancer. Of the individual cancers, by far the highest prevalence (almost 1%) was seen for breast cancer in females; more than one in three of all living female cancer patients had been diagnosed with breast cancer. For males, around half of prevalent cases had been diagnosed >5 years previously and 30% >10 years previously; for females, these figures were both higher, at approximately 60% and 40%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The estimates of prevalence presented here comprise: recently diagnosed patients in need of treatment and monitoring; long-term survivors, some of whom will nevertheless eventually die from the cancer, while others may be cured of the disease; and patients in the terminal phase who are dying from the cancer. Further work should attempt to identify the proportions of patients in the different phases of care in order to optimise the use of prevalence estimates in health care planning.","['Forman, D', 'Stockton, D', 'Moller, H', 'Quinn, M', 'Babb, P', 'De Angelis, R', 'Micheli, A']","['Forman D', 'Stockton D', 'Moller H', 'Quinn M', 'Babb P', 'De Angelis R', 'Micheli A']","['Northern and Yorkshire Cancer Registry and Information Service, Leeds, UK. d.forman@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries/*statistics & numerical data', 'Resource Allocation', 'Sex Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg169 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64105-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Apr;14(4):648-54. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg169.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5-year probability of overall survival is 71% (95% CI 65% to 77%). After a median follow-up of 48 months (range 1-108 months) only one case of AML was observed, resulting in a crude incidence of 0.27%. This case of AML was observed 18 months after HDCT consisting of three cycles of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide with a cumulative dose of epirubicin 960 mg and cyclophosphamide 19 g. The French-American-British type of AML was M4, and the cytogenetic analysis showed a translocation t(9;11)(p22;q23). After complete remission following high-dose cytarabine and idarubicin the patient relapsed and died. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to patients with malignant lymphoma there seems to be no increased risk of sMDS/AML after HDCT in breast cancer. Continued monitoring is required to confirm this low incidence after a longer follow-up period.","['Kroger, N', 'Zander, A R', 'Martinelli, G', 'Ferrante, P', 'Moraleda, J M', 'Da Prada, G A', 'Demirer, T', 'Socie, G', 'Rosti, G']","['Kroger N', 'Zander AR', 'Martinelli G', 'Ferrante P', 'Moraleda JM', 'Da Prada GA', 'Demirer T', 'Socie G', 'Rosti G']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, University Hospital Hamburg, Germany. nkroeger@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant/*adverse effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Neural Tube Defects/chemically induced/*epidemiology', 'Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/07/23 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/mdg161 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)64097-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2003 Apr;14(4):554-8. doi: 10.1093/annonc/mdg161.,,,,,,['European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of this mutant Kit in cell lines results in factor-independent growth, differentiation and increased survival in vitro and tumourigenicity in vivo. Mutant D816VKit and wild-type Kit were expressed in murine primary haemopoietic cells and grown in stem cell factor (SCF) or the absence of factors. Expression of D816VKit did not lead to transformation as assessed by a colony assay, but resulted in enhanced differentiation of cells when compared to control cells. D816VKit induced an increase in the number of cells differentiating along the megakaryocyte lineage in the absence of factors. SCF had an added effect with an increase in differentiation of mast cells. Expression of wild-type Kit in the presence of SCF also failed to cause transformation and induced differentiation of mast cells and megakaryocytes.

We have shown recently that these seemingly contradictory effects are based on the divergent capacities of the cells to produce granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) upon stimulation with TNF. Only those cells that produce GM-CSF survive the TNF attack and start growing. Here, we set out to elucidate the mechanisms of the antiapoptotic effect of GM-CSF. Protection from apoptosis was achieved by preincubating TF-1 cells with exogeneous GM-CSF. Cycloheximide prevented protection, indicating that GM-CSF might induce synthesis of antiapoptotic proteins. Regulation of protective genes was analyzed using cDNA expression arrays and the results were verified by Northern and Western blot analysis. This screen revealed the elevated expression of BCL-2, BCL-2A1, BAG-1 and TACE upon stimulation with GM-CSF. The major novelty of our study is that GM-CSF carries protective effects against TNF-induced apoptosis, not only against apoptosis induced by irradiation or cytokine-starvation. This protection requires de novo protein synthesis and is not-or at least not exclusively-the consequence of a direct crosstalk between the GM-CSF and TNF signaling pathways.","['Quentmeier, Hilmar', 'Reinhardt, Julia', 'Zaborski, Margarete', 'Drexler, Hans G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Reinhardt J', 'Zaborski M', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Mascheroder Weg 1B, D-38124, Braunschweig, Germany. hqu@dsmz.de']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['ADAM Proteins', 'ADAM17 Protein', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Metalloendopeptidases/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/07/02 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/02 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212602002692 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00269-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2003 Jun;27(6):539-45. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(02)00269-2.,,"['0 (BCL2-associated athanogene 1 protein)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (ADAM Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 Protein)', 'EC 3.4.24.86 (ADAM17 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 overexpression in mitochondria suppresses the release of these proapoptotic molecules, resulting in cell survival despite partial procaspase processing by granzyme B.

In vitro studies have suggested that allelic polymorphism in the HLA-DQA promoter region may result in differences in HLA-DQA1 gene expression. In the present study, we used real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify differences in HLA-DQA1 gene expression. After the isolation of total mRNA, reverse transcription into cDNA was carried out using random hexamer priming and moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase. Quantification of DQA1 mRNA species using a set of six group-specific primer pairs for the detection of HLA-DQA1*01, *02, *03, *04, *05 and *06 was carried out on an ABI PRISM GeneAmp 7700 Sequence Detection System (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) with real-time detection and quantification taking advantage of the fluorescence TaqMan technology (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA). Normalization of cDNA templates was achieved by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) quantification. In addition, the total amount of mRNA produced by HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DRA1 expression was quantified for comparison. Subsequently, this approach was validated using Raji and HUT-78 cell lines and tested with peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 45 samples taken from healthy volunteers. The sensitivity was determined with > or = 10(2) copies. Comparison of the allele-specific DQA1 expression with the total expression of DQA1 and DRA1 mRNA indicated that DQA1*04 expression was increased compared with the expression of other alleles of the DQA1 gene. Thus, allele-specific quantification of DQA1 gene products could be achieved by real-time RT-PCR suitable for the analysis of differential expression of DQA1 mRNAs in homozygote and heterozygote combinations.","['Fernandez, S', 'Wassmuth, R', 'Knerr, I', 'Frank, C', 'Haas, J P']","['Fernandez S', 'Wassmuth R', 'Knerr I', 'Frank C', 'Haas JP']","['Institute for Clinical Immunology, Department of Medicine III, Friedrich Alexander University, Erlangen-Nuremberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Immunogenet,European journal of immunogenetics : official journal of the British Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics,9106962,IM,"['HLA-DQ Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'HLA-DQ alpha-Chains', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis/genetics', 'HLA-DR alpha-Chains', 'Humans', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['376 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2370.2003.00376.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunogenet. 2003 Apr;30(2):141-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2370.2003.00376.x.,,"['0 (HLA-DQ Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DQ alpha-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DQA1 antigen)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR alpha-Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the mechanism regulating signal transducers and activators of transcription and the suppressor of cytokine signaling/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein family in keratinocytes, one of the major target cells for cytokines. Suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 mRNA was upregulated 3 h post-interferon gamma, and a 8.1-fold increase in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 mRNA occurred 48 h post-interferon gamma. The suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 mRNA was also upregulated from 1 h post-interferon gamma, and a 6.7-fold increase in the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 3 mRNA occurred between 6 and 12 h post-interferon gamma. Interleukin-6 exposure for 1 h enhanced the expression of the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 3 mRNA, but the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1/JAB mRNA was not induced by interleukin-6. Interleukin-4 upregulated the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1/JAB and cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 1 mRNA, with 3.4-fold and 5.1-fold increases in mRNA observed at 1 h post-interleukin-4, respectively. In contrast, epidermal growth factor, which phosphorylates signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, did not influence the level of the suppressor of cytokine signaling/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein family mRNA expression. Transfection of an adenovirus vector expressing the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1/JAB completely inhibited interferon gamma-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 phosphorylation and interleukin-4-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 phosphorylation. Transfection of adenovirus vector expressing the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1/JAB did not inhibit interleukin-6-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 phosphorylation-several reports show that the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1/JAB is a potent inhibitor of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 signaling in the myeloid leukemia M1 cell. Transfection of the adenovirus vector expressing suppressor of cytokine signaling 3/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 3 completely inhibited interleukin-6-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 phosphorylation and partially inhibited interferon gamma-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 phosphorylation. Transfection of the adenovirus vector expressing suppressor of cytokine signaling 3/cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 3, however, did not inhibit interleukin-4-dependent signal transducers and activators of transcription 6 phosphorylation. Transfection of the adenovirus vector expressing cytokine-inducible SH2 containing protein 1 had no effect on signal transducers and activators of transcription 1, 3, and 6 signaling in normal keratinocytes.

The NK antigens evaluated included: CD16, CD57, CD94, CD161, and the killing inhibitory receptors (KIRs) CD158a, CD158b and CD158e (p70). Abnormal T-antigen expression was present in all T-GLL patients. CD57 was frequently expressed in T-GLL, however, one-third of patients showed partial CD57 expression similar to that seen in T cells from normal control subjects. Ten T-GLL were KIR positive; all expressed a single KIR isoform. All NK-GLL showed a distinctive, abnormal immunophenotype. Four NK-GLL expressed a single KIR isoform; the remaining seven patients lacked all tested KIRs, which is also a distinct, abnormal finding. Immunoperoxidase staining of bone marrow biopsy specimens from NK-GLL patients with antibodies to CD8, TIA-1 and granzyme B revealed the disease-specific distinctive staining patterns previously found in T-GLL.

Other biological factors predicting an adverse outcome include p-glycoprotein (pgp) expression, which is associated with a reduced remission rate, and the presence of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3) internal tandem duplications (ITDs), predictive of a high rate of leukaemic relapse. Our previous work has indicated a drug efflux-independent role for pgp in apoptosis resistance. We measured spontaneous in vitro apoptosis in 58 primary AML samples to establish its relationship with functional and phenotypic pgp and with FLT3 ITDs. Cells were incubated for 48 h in a suspension culture, and the remaining viable cells were counted by flow cytometry. Median survival was 38% of baseline values. Resistance to spontaneous apoptosis was strongly associated with pgp (MRK-16 antibody) expression (P = 0.001) and with pgp functional activity (P < 0.001). FLT3 ITDs, found in 20 cases, were inversely associated with functional pgp activity: thus, the median pgp modulation ratio was 2.0 in FLT3 wild-type cases and 1.38 in ITD cases (P = 0.018). Also, the presence of FLT3 ITDs was not associated with in vitro apoptosis resistance. In conclusion, we have found that the presence of FLT3 ITDs is not related to AML blast survival in vitro, and is inversely associated with pgp activity, whereas pgp expression and activity are associated with resistance to spontaneous apoptosis. These results may help to explain the differing adverse effects of pgp (on remission induction) and FLT3 ITDs (on relapse) in AML.","['Pallis, Monica', 'Turzanski, Julie', 'Grundy, Martin', 'Seedhouse, Claire', 'Russell, Nigel']","['Pallis M', 'Turzanski J', 'Grundy M', 'Seedhouse C', 'Russell N']","['Division of Haematology, University of Nottingham and Nottingham City Hospital, Nottingham, UK. monica.pallis@nottingham.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', '*Apoptosis', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['4210 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04210.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Mar;120(6):1009-16. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04210.x.,,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For immunotherapies that employ antigen peptides, either alone or pulsed on dendritic cells (DC), the expression of human leucocyte antigen (HLA) molecules on the targeted leukaemic blasts (LB) is crucial. The co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 give the secondary signal to T lymphocytes that is necessary for the lysis of leukaemia cells, and CD40 enhances the efficacy of antigen presentation. Here, the expression of HLA-ABC, HLA-A2, HLA-DR, CD40, CD80 and CD86 was flow cytometrically examined in blood samples from 24 healthy volunteers (HV), 24 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and five patients with relapsed AML. The expression of HLA-ABC, CD40, CD80 and CD86 was significantly reduced on LB in comparison with monocytes of HV. HLA-A2 and HLA-DR expression was similar on LB and on monocytes of HV. In AML patients, the expression of HLA and CD86 molecules was significantly higher on LB than on CD33/CD34-negative monocytes. CD40 and CD80 molecules were deficient on AML blasts.

The peripheral blood BCR-ABL/ABL ratio, as assessed by Q-RT-PCR, has been shown to correlate with the contemporary cytogenetic response in patients receiving imatinib (Glivec, Gleevec). We have used Q-RT-PCR to monitor the early molecular response to 4 weeks and 3 months of imatinib therapy, in 47 patients with established CML. After 4 weeks of imatinib therapy, patients whose BCR-ABL/ABL ratio had fallen to less than 50% that of baseline had a significantly higher probability of achieving a major cytogenetic response after 6 months of therapy, when compared with those whose ratio did not fall by this amount (P < 0.001). Similarly, patients whose ratio at 3 months was less than 10% of that at baseline had a significantly higher probability of achieving a major cytogenetic remission at 6 months (P < 0.001). Patients who achieved these falls in their BCR-ABL/ABL ratio at either 4 weeks or 3 months had a superior progression-free survival at a median follow-up of 16.5 months (P = 0.01 and 0.003 respectively). These effects were independent of patient age and disease stage. The occurrence of peripheral blood cytopenias sufficiently severe to interrupt therapy was unrelated to progression-free survival. In conclusion, the data suggest that the early trend in the BCR-ABL/ABL ratio may be clinically useful for the early identification of patients destined to fare poorly on imatinib.","['Wang, Lihui', 'Pearson, Kevin', 'Ferguson, Julia E', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Wang L', 'Pearson K', 'Ferguson JE', 'Clark RE']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/08/09 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/08/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']","['4200 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04200.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2003 Mar;120(6):990-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2003.04200.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review is focused on findings derived from bone marrow (BM) biopsies in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) including a sex-mismatched host/donor constellation. Appropriate techniques involved immunophenotyping by monoclonal antibodies to identify the various cell lineages, dual color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with x- and y-chromosome-specific DNA-probes and a proper detection system for a simultaneous labeling of the bcr/abl locus. A significant degree of Ch with more than 20% host CD34+ progenitors was found in the early and late (up to 200 days after BMT) posttransplant period. However, only 10% of these cells harbored the bcr/abl translocation gene. This result fits well with corresponding molecular biological findings of so-called minimal residual disease. Conversion of Ch evolved during leukemic relapse with 90% host progenitors of which 50% revealed the bcr/abl locus. A Ch of nucleated erythroid percursors (5%) and CD68+ macrophages (8%) was expressed to a significantly lower degree. The slightly increased frequency found in CD61+ megakaryocytes (16%) was probably due to the polyploid state of these cells. Similar to the CD34+ progenitor cells abrupt changes from donor to host type was associated with an insidious transformation into recurrent leukemia. The CD34+ endothelial cells showed a minor degree of Ch, because donor-derived elements ranged from 18% to 25%. Leukemic relapse was characterized by an almost complete conversion of the endothelial cells to a host type. These findings point towards a CD34+ progenitor cell origin of the (leukemic) endothelial cell layer and suggests that their dysfunction may contribute to an expansion of the neoplastic clone.","['Thiele, J', 'Wickenhauser, C', 'Kvasnicka, H M', 'Varus, E', 'Beelen, D W', 'Schaefer, U W']","['Thiele J', 'Wickenhauser C', 'Kvasnicka HM', 'Varus E', 'Beelen DW', 'Schaefer UW']","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chimera/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/physiology', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Stem Cells']",121,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-18.557 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2003 Apr;18(2):557-74. doi: 10.14670/HH-18.557.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-18.557 [doi],,

PG-inhibited cell proliferation was determined using thymidine incorporation assay. PG-arrested cell cycle was analysed using immunoblot analysis with specific antibodies against cell cycle-related proteins and kinase assays of cdk2. Apoptosis was determined by Hoechst staining and analysis of DNA fragmentation. PG inhibited cyclin E, cdk2, p27 and p21, the induction of the cyclin A-cdk2 and cyclin E-cdk2 kinase activity, and the phosphorylation of Rb in leukaemic Jurkat cells. We confirmed that PG induces apoptosis by the characteristic DNA laddering pattern and condensed nuclei or apoptotic bodies identified by fluorescence microscopy. These results indicate that PG and other family members form a new group of molecules with a common mechanism of action and specific molecular targets, raising the possibility of their therapeutic use as antineoplastic drugs.","['Perez-Tomas, R', 'Montaner, B']","['Perez-Tomas R', 'Montaner B']","[""Departament de Biologia Cel.lular i Anatomia Patologica, Cancer Cell Biology Research Group, Universitat de Barcelona, L'Hospitalet (Barcelona), Spain. rperez@bell.ub.es""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Spain,Histol Histopathol,Histology and histopathology,8609357,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Coloring Agents', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Prodigiosin/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/09/23 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/09/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.14670/HH-18.379 [doi]'],ppublish,Histol Histopathol. 2003 Apr;18(2):379-85. doi: 10.14670/HH-18.379.,,"['0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'OL369FU7CJ (Prodigiosin)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-18.379 [doi],,

However, there are controversies about the kind of receptors and ligands related to the binding. Macrophages lacking class A scavenger receptor show identical binding of oxRBC with wild-type ones. METHODS: RBCs were oxidized with ascorbic acid and CuSO4. Lipid oxidation was measured indirectly by measuring TBARS semiquantitatively. The binding and phagocytosis were measured by counting the number of oxRBC bound or taken up after incubation at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 60 minutes to 100 macrophages differentiated from human monocytic leukemia cell line. RESULTS: The degree of oxidation and the binding of oxRBCs were dependent on the concentration of CuSO4. The binding and phagocytosis of oxRBC were inhibited by 99% with oxLDL. Fucoidan, competing class A scavenger receptor, inhibited the binding by more than 90%. The binding of oxRBC was higher at 37 degrees C than at 4 degrees C by 3 times. The binding of oxRBCs was maximal at pH 6.5 and higher than at physiologic pH by 2.8 times. At pH 8.5 and 9.5, binding decreased by 67 and 88%, respectively. CONCLUSION: OxRBCs might bind and be taken up to macrophages not mainly through class A nor B scavenger receptors, but through other scavenger receptors and/or pathways. These processes are dynamic and ionic strength might be involved.","['Ko, Hong Sook', 'Kim, In Seop', 'Lee, Kwangje', 'Kim, Sang Wook', 'Kim, Chee Jeong', 'Ryu, Wang Seong']","['Ko HS', 'Kim IS', 'Lee K', 'Kim SW', 'Kim CJ', 'Ryu WS']","['Division of Cardiology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),Korean J Intern Med,The Korean journal of internal medicine,8712418,IM,"['CD36 Antigens', '*Erythrocyte Aging', 'Erythrocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Phagocytosis/*physiology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/metabolism', '*Receptors, Lipoprotein', 'Receptors, Scavenger', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class A', 'Scavenger Receptors, Class B', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",,2003/03/22 04:00,2003/04/16 05:00,['2003/03/22 04:00'],"['2003/03/22 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/16 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/22 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.3904/kjim.2002.17.4.220 [doi]'],ppublish,Korean J Intern Med. 2002 Dec;17(4):220-6. doi: 10.3904/kjim.2002.17.4.220.,,"['0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Lipoprotein)', '0 (Receptors, Scavenger)', '0 (Scarb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class A)', '0 (Scavenger Receptors, Class B)']",,PMC4531690,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Screening of PML expression in human brain and sympathetic ganglia showed restricted expression of PML in mature neurons and glial cells, a result that was consistent with that in differentiated NB tumors. All these findings strongly suggest that increased PML expression is associated with growth inhibition and differentiation of human NB cells, and that it is of critical significance in the biology of NBs and in human nervous system development.","['Yu, Eunsil', 'Choi, Eun Kyung', 'Kim, Chong Jai']","['Yu E', 'Choi EK', 'Kim CJ']","['Department of Diagnostic Pathology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, 138-736, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Virchows Arch,Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology,9423843,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neuroblastoma/*pathology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2002/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00428-002-0756-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Virchows Arch. 2003 Mar;442(3):278-83. doi: 10.1007/s00428-002-0756-0.

METHODS: Cell growth was measured by an MTT assay. Cell viability was determined by a dye exclusion test. The level of P-gp expression was estimated using phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody 17F9. The function of P-gp was evaluated in terms of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) efflux. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. RESULTS: As(2)O(3) inhibited the growth and survival of MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of As(2)O(3) (IC(50)) against the growth of these cell lines were 5.1 micromol/l and 5.0 micromol/l, respectively, when the cells were treated with As(2)O(3) for 96 h. As(2)O(3) induced an apoptotic morphology in both MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cell lines. These effects of As(2)O(3) were time- and dose-dependent when the two cell lines were incubated in the presence of 1-8 micromol/l of As(2)O(3) for 3-144 h. As(2)O(3) treatment for 3 to 24 h at 5.0 micromol/l did not change the percentage of P-gp-expressing cells or the efflux ability of MOLT-4/DNR cells. CONCLUSION: As(2)O(3) inhibited growth and induced apoptosis equally in MOLT-4 and MOLT-4/DNR cells, and this suppressive effect did not influence P-gp expression or function in MOLT-4/DNR cells.","['Hu, Xiao-Mei', 'Hirano, Toshihiko', 'Oka, Kitaro']","['Hu XM', 'Hirano T', 'Oka K']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo 192-0392, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/03/27 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2002/06/14 00:00 [received]', '2002/10/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/03/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s00280-002-0543-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2003 Feb;51(2):119-26. doi: 10.1007/s00280-002-0543-2.

Correlation between antibody affinity and biological activity.,604-11,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFR) have been implicated in promoting solid tumor growth and metastasis via stimulating tumor-associated angiogenesis. We recently showed that certain 'liquid' tumors such as leukemia not only produce VEGF, but also express functional VEGFR, resulting in an autocrine loop for tumor growth and propagation. A chimeric anti-VEGFR2 (or kinase insert domain-containing receptor, KDR) antibody, IMC-1C11, was shown to be able to inhibit VEGF-induced proliferation of human leukemia cells in vitro, and to prolong survival of nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune deficient (NOD-SCID) mice inoculated with human leukemia cells. Here we produced two fully human anti-KDR antibodies (IgG1), IMC-2C6 and IMC-1121, from Fab fragments originally isolated from a large antibody phage display library. These antibodies bind specifically to KDR with high affinities: 50 and 200 pM for IMC-1121 and IMC-2C6, respectively, as compared to 270 pM for IMC-1C11. Like IMC-1C11, both human antibodies block VEGF/KDR interaction with an IC(50) of approximately 1 nM, but IMC-1121 is a more potent inhibitor to VEGF-stimulated proliferation of human endothelial cells. These anti-KDR antibodies strongly inhibited VEGF-induced migration of human leukemia cells in vitro, and when administered in vivo, significantly prolonged survival of NOD-SCID mice inoculated with human leukemia cells. It is noteworthy that the mice treated with antibody of the highest affinity, IMC-1121, survived the longest period of time, followed by mice treated with IMC-2C6 and IMC-1C11. Taken together, our data suggest that anti-KDR antibodies may have broad applications in the treatment of both solid tumors and leukemia. It further underscores the efforts to identify antibodies of high affinity for enhanced antiangiogenic and antitumor activities.","['Zhu, Z', 'Hattori, K', 'Zhang, H', 'Jimenez, X', 'Ludwig, D L', 'Dias, S', 'Kussie, P', 'Koo, H', 'Kim, H J', 'Lu, D', 'Liu, M', 'Tejada, R', 'Friedrich, M', 'Bohlen, P', 'Witte, L', 'Rafii, S']","['Zhu Z', 'Hattori K', 'Zhang H', 'Jimenez X', 'Ludwig DL', 'Dias S', 'Kussie P', 'Koo H', 'Kim HJ', 'Lu D', 'Liu M', 'Tejada R', 'Friedrich M', 'Bohlen P', 'Witte L', 'Rafii S']","['Department of Antibody Technology, ImClone Systems Incorporated, New York, NY 10014, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Survival Rate', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/*immunology', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402831 [doi]', '2402831 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Mar;17(3):604-11. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402831.,,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GM-CSF and long-term treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) or interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) were used to manipulate the cell cycle status. Control cells were GM-CSF deprived, nonproliferating cells. IFN-gamma or IFN-alpha treatment did not induce proliferation in control cells, but resulted in recruitment of cells from resting G(0) phase into activated G(1) phase. Using agonistic anti-Fas antibodies (FAS18), we demonstrated that this shift from G(0) to G(1) was accompanied by a 2.5-fold increase in Fas sensitivity. A similar increase in sensitivity to FAS18 could be obtained by induction of proliferation with GM-CSF. Quantitative FACS analysis of surviving cells after FAS18-induced apoptosis showed deletion of the G(1) compartment, but complete protection of resting G(0) cells. Cells in S or G(2)/M phase were relatively protected against Fas induction. In conclusion, sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis was restricted to cells in G(1) phase of the cell cycle, and can be increased by treatment of cells with interferons.

Importantly, since fibrates and MPA are inexpensive and stable with minimal-associated toxicities, we suggest that these drugs should be considered as adjuncts to currently available treatments for BL in endemic and AIDS-related disease.","['Fenton, S L', 'Luong, Q T', 'Sarafeim, A', 'Mustard, K J W', 'Pound, J', 'Desmond, J C', 'Gordon, J', 'Drayson, M T', 'Bunce, C M']","['Fenton SL', 'Luong QT', 'Sarafeim A', 'Mustard KJ', 'Pound J', 'Desmond JC', 'Gordon J', 'Drayson MT', 'Bunce CM']","['Division of Medical Sciences, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Clofibric Acid/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Hypolipidemic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Medroxyprogesterone Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/pharmacology', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'bcl-X Protein']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402843 [doi]', '2402843 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Mar;17(3):568-75. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402843.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Hypolipidemic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '53PF01Q249 (Clofibric Acid)', 'C2QI4IOI2G (Medroxyprogesterone Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the impact of telomerase inhibition by the dominant-negative human catalytic subunit of telomerase (DN-hTERT) on the biological features of acute leukemia. We introduced vectors encoding dominant- negative (DN)-hTERT, wild-type (WT)-hTERT, or a control vector expressing only a drug-resistant marker into a telomerase-positive human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, HAL-01. Expression of DN-hTERT dramatically inhibited telomerase activity, leading to apoptotic cell death. Mutant telomerase expression also enhanced daunorubicin-induced apoptosis. Nude mice (n=5 per group) received subcutanous implants of HAL-01 cells expressing the control vector or DN-hTERT or WT-hTERT. Implantation of HAL-01 cells expressing control vector (n=5) rapidly produced tumors, whereas implantation of those expressing DN-hTERT (n=5) did not. Thus, telomerase inhibition both growth of HAL-01 cells in vitro and tumorigenic capacity in vivo. Furthermore, the G-quadruplex-interactive telomerase-specific inhibitor, telomestatin, shortened the telomere length and induced apoptosis in freshly isolated primary acute leukemia cells. These results suggest that antitelomerase therapy may be useful in some acute leukemias in combination with antileukemic agents such as daunorubicin.","['Nakajima, A', 'Tauchi, T', 'Sashida, G', 'Sumi, M', 'Abe, K', 'Yamamoto, K', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Ohyashiki, K']","['Nakajima A', 'Tauchi T', 'Sashida G', 'Sumi M', 'Abe K', 'Yamamoto K', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Ohyashiki K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical University, Shinjuku-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Genes, Dominant', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mutation', 'Telomerase/administration & dosage/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/*pharmacology', 'Telomere/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402825 [doi]', '2402825 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Mar;17(3):560-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402825.,,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because of the large heterogeneity of myeloid-related lineages, no clinically relevant immunological classification of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) has been devised so far. To attempt at formulating such a classification, we analyzed the pattern of expression of selected antigens, on blast cells collected at AML diagnosis. Patients were eligible if they had a first diagnosis of de novo AML and a sufficient number of blast cells for proper immunophenotyping. The relative expression of CD7, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, CD34, CD35, CD36, CD65, CD117, and HLA-DR were analyzed by cytometry in a test series of 176 consecutive AML cases. Statistical tools of clusterization allowed to remove antigens with overlapping distribution, leading us to propose an AML classification that was validated in a second AML cohort of 733 patients. We identified five AML subsets (MA to ME) based on the expression of seven antigens within four groups (CD13/CD33/CD117, CD7, CD35/CD36, CD15).-MA and MB-AML have exclusively myeloid features with seldom extramedullary disease and rare expression of lymphoid antigens. No cases of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were observed within MB AML. MC AML have either myeloid or erythroblastic features. MD AML have more frequently high WBC counts than other subsets, which were related to the expression of CD35/CD36 and CD14 and to monoblastic differentiation. ME AML lack CD13, CD33, and CD117 but display signs of terminal myeloid differentiation. Specific independent prognostic factors were related to poor overall survival in each immunological subset: CD34+ (P<3 x 10(-4)) in MA AML, CD7+ in MB AML, non-APL cases (P<0.03) in MC AML, CD34+ (P<0.002) and CD14+ (P<0.03) in MD AML, CD14+ in ME AML (P<0.01).

Management of hyperuricema has historically consisted of administration of allopurinol, hydration, alkalinization to maintain pH between 7.0 and 7.3, and in some cases diuresis. Allopurinol, a xanthine analogue, blocks xanthine oxidase and formation of uric acid. Urate oxidase converts uric acid to allantoin, which is 5-10 times more soluble than uric acid.

Treatment with this nonrecombinant product had been effective in preventing renal precipitation of uric acid in cancer patients, but was associated with a relatively high frequency of allergic reactions. This enzyme was recently cloned from A. flavus and is now manufactured as a recombinant protein. Clinical trials have shown this drug to be more effective than allopurinol for prevention and treatment of hyperuricemia in leukemia and lymphoma patients. This drug has been approved in Europe as well as the US and several clinical trials are in progress to further determine its clinical utility in other patient subsets. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss usefulness of recombinant urate oxidase, also known as rasburicase, Fasturtec, and Elitek, for the management of TLS in certain cancer patients.","['Navolanic, P M', 'Pui, C-H', 'Larson, R A', 'Bishop, M R', 'Pearce, T E', 'Cairo, M S', 'Goldman, S C', 'Jeha, S C', 'Shanholtz, C B', 'Leonard, J P', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Navolanic PM', 'Pui CH', 'Larson RA', 'Bishop MR', 'Pearce TE', 'Cairo MS', 'Goldman SC', 'Jeha SC', 'Shanholtz CB', 'Leonard JP', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Allopurinol/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites/therapeutic use', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyperuricemia/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Lysis Syndrome/*complications/drug therapy/prevention & control', 'Urate Oxidase/*therapeutic use']",53,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/17 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.leu.2402847 [doi]', '2402847 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2003 Mar;17(3):499-514. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402847.,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Antimetabolites)', '08GY9K1EUO (rasburicase)', '63CZ7GJN5I (Allopurinol)', 'EC 1.7.3.3 (Urate Oxidase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the roles of the Src kinase Lyn, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the beta and gamma subunits of Fc epsilon RI, and Syk itself in the activation of Syk. Our approach was to build a detailed mathematical model of reactions involving Fc epsilon RI, Lyn, Syk, and a bivalent ligand that aggregates Fc(epsilon)RI. We applied the model to experiments in which covalently cross-linked IgE dimers stimulate rat basophilic leukemia cells. The model makes it possible to test the consistency of mechanistic assumptions with data that alone provide limited mechanistic insight. For example, the model helps sort out mechanisms that jointly control dephosphorylation of receptor subunits. In addition, interpreted in the context of the model, experimentally observed differences between the beta- and gamma-chains with respect to levels of phosphorylation and rates of dephosphorylation indicate that most cellular Syk, but only a small fraction of Lyn, is available to interact with receptors. We also show that although the beta ITAM acts to amplify signaling in experimental systems where its role has been investigated, there are conditions under which the beta ITAM will act as an inhibitor.","['Faeder, James R', 'Hlavacek, William S', 'Reischl, Ilona', 'Blinov, Michael L', 'Metzger, Henry', 'Redondo, Antonio', 'Wofsy, Carla', 'Goldstein, Byron']","['Faeder JR', 'Hlavacek WS', 'Reischl I', 'Blinov ML', 'Metzger H', 'Redondo A', 'Wofsy C', 'Goldstein B']","['Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM 87545, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Validation Study']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs/immunology', 'Animals', 'Dimerization', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Ligands', '*Models, Chemical', '*Models, Immunological', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding/immunology', 'Protein Subunits/chemistry/metabolism/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/chemistry/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*immunology', 'Software', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/immunology', 'src-Family Kinases/chemistry/metabolism']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/07/09 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/09 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.170.7.3769 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2003 Apr 1;170(7):3769-81. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.170.7.3769.,['GM35556/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms regulating cytochrome c apoptotic activity are not understood. Here we demonstrate that cytochrome c is nitrosylated on its heme iron during apoptosis. Nitrosylated cytochrome c is found predominantly in the cytoplasm in control cells. In contrast, when cytochrome c release from mitochondria is inhibited by overexpression of the anti-apoptotic proteins B cell lymphoma/leukemia (Bcl)-2 or Bcl-X(L), nitrosylated cytochrome c is found in the mitochondria. These data suggest that during apoptosis, cytochrome c is nitrosylated in mitochondria and then rapidly released into the cytoplasm in the absence of Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) overexpression. In vitro nitrosylation of cytochrome c increases caspase-3 activation in cell lysates. Moreover, the inhibition of intracellular cytochrome c nitrosylation is associated with a decrease in apoptosis, suggesting that cytochrome c nitrosylation is a proapoptotic modification. We conclude that nitrosylation of the heme iron of cytochrome c may be a novel mechanism of apoptosis regulation.","['Schonhoff, Christopher M', 'Gaston, Benjamin', 'Mannick, Joan B']","['Schonhoff CM', 'Gaston B', 'Mannick JB']","['Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01605, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acridine Orange/pharmacology', 'Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytochrome c Group/*metabolism', 'Fluorescent Dyes/pharmacology', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Nitrogen/metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Time Factors', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'bcl-X Protein', 'fas Receptor/metabolism']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/06/26 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/26 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M212459200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)54926-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 May 16;278(20):18265-70. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M212459200.

The energy is expressed as a sum of the energies of interaction between side chains, and a harmonic penalty function accounting for the preservation of the positions of the C(alpha) atoms and the side-chain centroids. The energy of side-chain interactions is calculated with the soft-sphere ECEPP/3 potential. A Monte Carlo search is carried out to explore all possible side-chain orientations within a fixed backbone and side-chain centroid positions. The initial, usually extended, side-chain conformations are taken directly from the ECEPP/3 database. The procedure was tested on six experimental (X-ray or NMR) structures: immunoglobulin binding protein (PDB code 1IGD, an alpha+beta-protein); transcription factor PML (PDB code 1BOR, a 49-104 fragment of the ring finger domain, predominantly beta-protein); bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (crystal form II) (PDB code 1BPI, an alpha+beta-protein); the monomer of human deoxyhemoglobin (PDB code 1BZ0, an alpha-helical structure); chain A of alcohol dehydrogenase from Drosophila lebanonensis (PDB code 1A4U); as well as on the 10-55 portion of the B domain of staphylococcal protein A (PDB code 1BDD). In all cases except 1BPI, the data for the algorithm (i.e. the backbone or C(alpha) coordinates and the positions of side-chain centroids) were taken from the experimental structures. For protein A, the C(alpha) coordinates and positions of side-chain centroids were also taken from the 1.9-A-resolution model predicted by the UNRES force field. In all comparisons with experimental structures, complete side-chain geometry was reconstructed with a root-mean-square (RMS) deviation of approximately 0.6-0.9 A from the heavy atoms when complete backbone and side-chain-centroid coordinates were used in reconstruction, or approximately 1.0 A when the C(alpha) and centroid coordinates were used.","['Kazmierkiewicz, Rajmund', 'Liwo, Adam', 'Scheraga, Harold A']","['Kazmierkiewicz R', 'Liwo A', 'Scheraga HA']","['Baker Laboratory of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853-1301, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biophys Chem,Biophysical chemistry,0403171,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Aprotinin/chemistry', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry', 'Cattle', 'Computational Biology', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones/chemistry', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Peptides/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Proteins/*chemical synthesis/*chemistry', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/chemistry', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/12/05 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301462202002855 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-4622(02)00285-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Biophys Chem. 2003;100(1-3):261-80. doi: 10.1016/s0301-4622(02)00285-5.,"['3 T09A 111 17/PHS HHS/United States', 'GM-14312/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P41RR-04293/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 TW1064/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']","['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Endoplasmic Reticulum Chaperone BiP)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9087-70-1 (Aprotinin)']",,,,,,,,['Biophys Chem. 2003 Oct 1;106(1):91'],,,,,,,,,,,,

These episodes were divided into 3 cohorts: the first was treated with levofloxacin, the second with cotrimoxazol and the third was a subgroup without antibiotic prophylaxis (control group). The incidence of infection, rate of mortality, and reduction of hospitalization rate for treatment with parenteral antibiotics were tested. RESULTS: There was a reduction in documented infections (clinically or microbiologically) when comparing the levofloxacin cohort with the control cohort (p < 0.0001) and the levofloxacin cohort with the cotrimoxazol group (p < 0.01). The reduction in the hospitalization rate for treatment with parenteral antibiotics reached statistical significance when comparing the levofloxacin group with the control cohort (p < 0.001) and levofloxacin group with the cotrimoxazol group (p < 0.05). Although the rate of global mortality was lower in the levofloxacin group than in the other two groups, no statistical significance was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that levofloxacin effectively reduces the incidence of infection, the rate of hospitalization and the requirement for parenteral antibiotics. Although we found a reduction in the overall mortality and in the infection-related mortality, the corresponding data did not reach statistical significance.","['Gracia Escudero, Antonio', 'Martin Gonzalez, Manuel', 'Gimenez Garrido, Francisco', 'Clavero Farre, Carlos', 'Garcia Perez, Maria Jose', 'Alvarez Corral, Gemma', 'Reyes Bertos, Armando', 'Villegas Maldonado, Gracia', 'Rodriguez Cuartero, Antonio']","['Gracia Escudero A', 'Martin Gonzalez M', 'Gimenez Garrido F', 'Clavero Farre C', 'Garcia Perez MJ', 'Alvarez Corral G', 'Reyes Bertos A', 'Villegas Maldonado G', 'Rodriguez Cuartero A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Torrecardenas, Almeria, Spain. hematologia@eresmas.com']",['spa'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Med Clin (Barc),Medicina clinica,0376377,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology/therapy', '*Levofloxacin', 'Lymphoma/immunology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*immunology', 'Ofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Opportunistic Infections/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Prospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']",['S0025-7753(03)73691-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Med Clin (Barc). 2003 Mar 15;120(9):321-5.,,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '6GNT3Y5LMF (Levofloxacin)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",,,,,"Estudio prospectivo y controlado, no aleatorizado, de tres cohortes sobre la efectividad de dos pautas antibioticas, levofloxacino y contrimoxazol, en profilaxis antibacteriana de pacientes neutropenicos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These complexes have been characterized by (1)H and (195)Pt NMR spectroscopy, and also the X-ray crystal structure of 1b has been determined. The reactions of 1a, 2, and 3 with guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) have been monitored and kinetically investigated in D(2)O solutions at 310 K using (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Both 1a and 2 react with 2 equiv of GMP to form 1:2 complexes. The reactions involve a stepwise direct substitution of chloride ligands by GMP, with similar reaction rates for both complexes. On the other hand, the reaction of 3 with GMP results in the cleavage of one of the Pt-N(pyridazine) bonds to form an N7,O6-platinated polymer. The reaction products have been separated and have been characterized by (1)H and (195)Pt NMR spectroscopy. A cytotoxicity assay of the azine-bridged complexes (1a, 1b, 2, and 3) has been performed on human tumor cell lines and two L1210 murine leukemia cell lines (one sensitive to and one resistant to cisplatin). In general, the complexes show lower cytotoxicity than cisplatin for the human tumor cell lines except for the IGROV cell line. Their cytotoxicity for the mouse cell lines is comparable to or higher than that of cisplatin. Furthermore, these complexes appeared to largely or partly overcome the cross-resistance to cisplatin. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of a structure-activity relationship for this class of compounds.","['Komeda, Seiji', 'Kalayda, Ganna V', 'Lutz, Martin', 'Spek, Anthony L', 'Yamanaka, Yasuyuki', 'Sato, Takaji', 'Chikuma, Masahiko', 'Reedijk, Jan']","['Komeda S', 'Kalayda GV', 'Lutz M', 'Spek AL', 'Yamanaka Y', 'Sato T', 'Chikuma M', 'Reedijk J']","['Leiden Institute of Chemistry, Gorlaeus Laboratories, Leiden University, P.O.

We found that erythroblasts were the primary target cells for both F-MuLV and FIS-2, while B- and T-cells were infected later in the infection. Although FIS-2 replicated to similar titres as F-MuLV, we observed a delay in peak viraemia titre and in the number of virus-positive cells in bone marrow and spleen. Studies including the chimeric viruses RE3 (FIS-2LTR with a F-MuLV background) and RE4 (F-MuLV LTR with a FIS-2 background) indicated that the delay in dissemination was due to mutations in FIS-2 LTR. The kinetics for early virus replication correlated with previously reported mean latency time for virus-induced erythroleukaemia in mice inoculated as newborns and with the onset of immunosuppression in adult mice. In addition, F-MuLV-induced late immunosuppression coincided with signs of erythroleukaemia and persistent viraemia. FIS-2 induced a more moderate late immunosuppression without persistent viraemia or signs of erythroleukaemia. Overall, our findings indicated that early viral replication is a prognostic factor in murine retrovirus-induced pathogenesis.","['Bruland, Torunn', 'Dai, Hong Yan', 'Lavik, Liss Anne S', 'Dalen, Are']","['Bruland T', 'Dai HY', 'Lavik LA', 'Dalen A']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.

A survey of 42 cases of APL with cytogenetic study performed at our institutionover the past 10 years showed 12 cases (28.6%) having chromosomal changes in addition to t(15;17). Trisomy 8 and trisomy 21 as additional changes were noted in 4 and 2 cases, respectively, with one patient showing both trisomies simultaneously. Two cases showed t(15;17) in hyperdiploid clones. Among the 10 patients with follow-up data, all eventually relapsed and none achieved continuous complete remission 1. Survival analysis performed in APL patients with adequate follow-up data showed no significant difference in overall and disease free survival between those with and without additional cytogenetic changes. After excluding cases with one induction death, the overall survival was significantly in favor of the group without additional cytogenetic abnormalities (P = 0.022). Late relapses may therefore be significantly more common in APL patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and may not be reflected by analysis focused at three-year survival only. As APL is now considered a curable disease, any confirmed long-term survival impact of additional cytogenetic changes is expected to have important management implications.","['Wan, T S K', 'Ma, S K', 'Au, W Y', 'Liu, H S Y', 'Chan, J C W', 'Chan, L C']","['Wan TS', 'Ma SK', 'Au WY', 'Liu HS', 'Chan JC', 'Chan LC']","[""Division of Hematology, Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/ultrastructure', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Death, Sudden', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hong Kong/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Embolism/etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', '*Trisomy']",15,2003/03/21 04:00,2003/04/18 05:00,['2003/03/21 04:00'],"['2003/03/21 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/18 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/21 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0165460802006842 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00684-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Jan 15;140(2):170-3. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(02)00684-2.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tryptic digest of the gel-separated protein was prefractionated on POROS R2/OLIGO R3 microcolumns and subjected to phosphotyrosine mapping by precursor ion scanning in positive ion mode utilizing the immonium ion of phosphotyrosine, also called phosphotyrosine-specific immonium ion scanning, on a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer. In total, nine different phosphorylated tyrosine residues were unambiguously localized in 12 different precursor ions. These phosphorylation sites correspond to three previously described phosphotyrosine residues and six novel tyrosine phosphorylation sites, and most of them were not predicted by the phosphorylation motif prediction programs ProSite, NetPhos, or ScanSite. This study shows the power of phosphotyrosine-specific immonium ion scanning for sensitive phosphotyrosine mapping when limited amounts of samples are available.","['Steen, Hanno', 'Fernandez, Minerva', 'Ghaffari, Saghi', 'Pandey, Akhilesh', 'Mann, Matthias']","['Steen H', 'Fernandez M', 'Ghaffari S', 'Pandey A', 'Mann M']","['Center for Experimental Bioinformatics, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Southern Denmark, 5230 Odense M, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Proteomics,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,101125647,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Onium Compounds/*chemistry', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/*chemistry']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2005/12/13 09:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2005/12/13 09:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/mcp.M300001-MCP200 [doi]', 'S1535-9476(20)34459-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Proteomics. 2003 Mar;2(3):138-45. doi: 10.1074/mcp.M300001-MCP200.

We have previously described an in vitro model of this proliferating pool of cells using B-CLL cells stimulated with immunostimulatory oligonucleotides (CpG-ODN) and interleukin-2. Lactacystin is a specific inhibitor of the proteasome and is a potent apoptosis inductor in resting peripheral B-CLL cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of proteasome inhibition in proliferating B-CLL cells. METHODS: The effect of proteasome inhibition was analyzed using thymidine incorporation, annexin V assays, and TUNEL staining. Immunoblots were performed to evaluate expression of proteins involved in cell cycle and apoptosis regulation. RESULTS: Lactacystin blocked cell cycle progression in activated B-CLL cells and inhibited degradation of p27. Upregulation of cyclin D2 and D3 in activated B-CLL cells was inhibited while the expression of cdk2, cdk4, and cyclin E remained unchanged. Activated B-CLL cells were more susceptible to apoptosis induction as compared to resting B-CLL cells. Apoptosis induction was accompanied by cleavage of Bax, procaspase 8, procaspase 9, and procaspase 3. However, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor (z-VAD.fmk) only partially inhibited cell death although DNA degradation was completely inhibited. CONCLUSION: Proteasome inhibition is highly effective in proliferating B-CLL cells and induces apoptosis using a caspase-dependent and -independent pathway.","['Bogner, Christian', 'Schneller, Folker', 'Hipp, Susanne', 'Ringshausen, Ingo', 'Peschel, Christian', 'Decker, Thomas']","['Bogner C', 'Schneller F', 'Hipp S', 'Ringshausen I', 'Peschel C', 'Decker T']","['IIIrd Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', '*Cell Cycle', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclins/drug effects', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/drug effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010767 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01076-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Mar;31(3):218-25. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01076-7.,,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '133343-34-7 (lactacystin)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",,,['Copyright 2003 International Society for Experimental Hematology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic alterations of the INK4A/ARF locus have been implicated in the lymphoid blast crisis (BC), but sequential studies are not available. The aim of this study was to contribute to a better knowledge of the status of such locus in the different phases of CML and to analyze the prognostic significance of its inactivation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sequential assessment by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and conventional semiquantitative PCR of p16 exon 2 deletions was performed in 42 CML patients in whom paired DNA samples from the chronic phase and the BC were available. Samples of 10 healthy donors and 30 patients with nonleukemic myeloproliferative syndromes served as controls. The methylation status of the promoter region of the p16 gene was also studied by methylation-specific PCR. RESULTS: The concordance rate between the two PCR techniques was 97.8% (87/89). By real-time PCR, homozygous p16 deletions were found in 6 of 21 patients (29%) with lymphoid BC, whereas they were not observed in chronic-phase CML nor in 21 myeloid BC patients. Hypermethylation of the p16 gene was not detected in any of the lymphoid BC. No specific clinical profile was associated with homozygous p16 deletions. Therapeutic response and survival did not significantly differ in p16-deleted and p16 germline lymphoid BC patients. CONCLUSION: P16 gene deletions are detected in a substantial proportion of lymphoid BC of CML by quantitative real-time PCR analysis, but this is not associated with any clinico-hematological feature other than lymphoid phenotype and does not influence the patients' outcome. Such technique is simple and reliable to assess the p16 gene status.","['Hernandez-Boluda, Juan-Carlos', 'Cervantes, Francisco', 'Colomer, Dolors', 'Vela, Mari-Carmen', 'Costa, Dolors', 'Paz, Maria-Fe', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Montserrat, Emilio']","['Hernandez-Boluda JC', 'Cervantes F', 'Colomer D', 'Vela MC', 'Costa D', 'Paz MF', 'Esteller M', 'Montserrat E']","['Hematology Department, Hospital Clinic, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Genes, p16', 'Genome, Human', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010755 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01075-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Mar;31(3):204-10. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01075-5.,,,,,['Copyright 2003 International Society for Experimental Hematology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The transcription nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is important for cell survival by regulating the expression of anti-apoptotic genes. Several cytokines can modulate leukemic growth and apoptosis in B-CLL. The aim of this study was to determine whether cytokine-mediated regulation of apoptosis occurs via modulation of NF-kappaB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from B-CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated NF-kappaB activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 15 untreated B-CLL patients and 11 controls in resting conditions and in the presence of phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) and different cytokines by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Apoptosis was studied by spectrophotometric analysis of DNA fragmentation. RESULTS: We found a constitutive high NF-kappaB activity not induced by PMA in B-CLL patients, in contrast with a normal inducible NF-kappaB activity in controls. In B-CLL cultures, addition of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 increased, whereas transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta reduced NF-kappaB activity compared with unstimulated cultures. Accordingly, IL-4 and IL-13 decreased, whereas TGF-beta increased DNA fragmentation compared with unstimulated cultures. IL-13 and IL-4 production was increased, whereas TGF-beta was reduced in PMA-stimulated and unstimulated cultures from B-CLL patients compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: B-CLL patients have a constitutive high NF-kappaB activity, which is modulated by cytokines. In particular, TGF-beta displays a pro-apoptotic activity, whereas IL-4 and IL-13 have opposite effects. These cytokine alterations could be responsible for a positive autocrine circuit that maintains leukemic cells in a pre-apoptotic state.","['Zaninoni, Anna', 'Imperiali, Francesca Guia', 'Pasquini, Cristina', 'Zanella, Alberto', 'Barcellini, Wilma']","['Zaninoni A', 'Imperiali FG', 'Pasquini C', 'Zanella A', 'Barcellini W']","['Dipartimento di Ematologia, IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-13/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-kappa B/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0301472X02010469 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01046-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2003 Mar;31(3):185-90. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(02)01046-9.,,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-13)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,['Copyright 2003 International Society for Experimental Hematology'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemistry for LIF revealed that LIF immunoreactivity was present in the atrial and ventricular myocytes of the normal heart and was markedly increased in the failing heart as compared to the normal heart. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that cardiac LIF mRNA was increased in both atrium and ventricle in CHF as compared to the normal heart (P<0.01). Linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between atrial LIF mRNA and atrial pressure (r=0.87, P<0.001 in right atrium and r=0.86, P<0.001 in left atrium). Positive correlations between left ventricular LIF mRNA and left ventricular dimensions (r=0.91, P<0.0001 in end-systolic diameter; r=0.86, P<0.001 in end-diastolic diameter), and an inverse correlation between left ventricular LIF mRNA and left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) were observed (r=-0.93, P<0.0001).

The approach is closely related to a method we developed for the use of specific molecular size markers and used for determination of the absolute number of randomly distributed radiation-induced DSBs by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Mouse leukemia L1210 cells were X-irradiated with 0-50 Gy. Samples were then evaluated both with PFGE and with NFE. Assuming that with both migration (PFGE) and elution (NFE), a heterogeneous population of double-stranded DNA fragments will start with the smallest fragments and proceed with increasingly larger fragments, it is possible to match the migration behavior of fractions of fragments smaller than a certain size to the fraction eluted at a specific time. This assumption does not exclude the possibility of DNA being sheared in the NFE filter. The yield, as determined by the size markers in PFGE, was used to find the corresponding elution times in the NFE experiment. These experimentally used elution times could then reversely be interpreted as size markers which finally were used to calculate DSBs/Mbp as a function of X-ray dose. The resulting lines were almost straight. The data were also plotted as relative elution and showed that, as expected, the dose response then appears with a more pronounced sigmoid shape.","['Cedervall, Bjorn', 'Edgren, Margareta R', 'Lewensohn, Rolf']","['Cedervall B', 'Edgren MR', 'Lewensohn R']","['Medical Radiation Biology, Department of Oncology and Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, Box 260, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. cedervall@raffys.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification/*radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field', 'Filtration/*methods', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Weight', 'Random Allocation', 'Rheology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/13 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0495:xridds]2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Res. 2003 Apr;159(4):495-501. doi: 10.1667/0033-7587(2003)159[0495:xridds]2.0.co;2.,,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases of Poland's syndrome associated with leukemia, carcinoma of the hypoplastic breast, and other conditions, confirm the relationship between developmental defects and tumors, and require oncologic awareness. Various manifestations, age, and gender require different surgical approaches. Our experience, which includes 27 patients (15 male, 12 female), 20 of whom (12 male, 8 female) underwent operation, suggests that the repair should be done in two stages in children and in a single stage in adults.

The interleukin-6 receptor can serve as an alpha-receptor for CTNF.,9528-35,"Human ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) is a neurotrophic cytokine that exerts a neuroprotective effect in multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Clinical application of human CNTF, however, was prevented by high toxicity at higher dosages. Human CNTF elicits cellular responses by induction of a receptor complex consisting of the CNTF alpha-receptor (CNTFR), which is not involved in signal transduction, and the beta-receptors gp130 and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Previous studies with rat CNTF demonstrated that rat CNTF is unable to interact with the human interleukin-6 alpha-receptor, whereas at high concentrations, it can directly induce a signaling heterodimer of human gp130 and human LIFR in the absence of the CNTF receptor. Here, we demonstrate that human CNTF cannot directly induce a heterodimer of human gp130 and LIFR. However, human CNTF can use both the membrane-bound and the soluble human IL-6R as a substitute for its cognate alpha-receptor and thus widen the target spectrum of human CNTF. Engineering a CNTFR-specific human CNTF variant may therefore be a prerequisite to improving the safety profile of CNTF.","['Schuster, Bjorn', 'Kovaleva, Marina', 'Sun, Yi', 'Regenhard, Petra', 'Matthews, Vance', 'Grotzinger, Joachim', 'Rose-John, Stefan', 'Kallen, Karl-Josef']","['Schuster B', 'Kovaleva M', 'Sun Y', 'Regenhard P', 'Matthews V', 'Grotzinger J', 'Rose-John S', 'Kallen KJ']","['Biochemisches Institut, Christian Albrechts Universitat zu Kiel, Olshausenstr. 40, D-24098 Kiel, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Division', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Rats', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.m210044200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71335-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 14;278(11):9528-35. doi: 10.1074/jbc.m210044200.,,"['0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we demonstrate that a controlled increase in [Ca2+]i induces hormone-independent survival and proliferation of TF-1 cells. We found that moderate elevation of [Ca2+]i by the addition of cyclopiasonic-acid protected TF1 cells from apoptosis. Furthermore, a higher, but transient elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin treatment induced cell proliferation. In both cases caspase-3 activity was reduced, and Bcl-2 was up-regulated. Higher elevation of [Ca2+]i by ionomycin induced MEK-dependent biphasic ERK1/2 activation, sufficient to move the cells from G0/G1 to S/M phases. Meanwhile, activation of ERK1/2, phosphorylation of the Elk-1 transcription factor, and, consequently, a substantial elevation of Egr-1 and c-Fos levels and AP-1 DNA binding were observed. Moderate elevation of [Ca2+]i, on the other hand, caused a delayed monophasic activation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1 that was accompanied with only a small increase of Egr-1 and c-Fos levels and AP-1 DNA binding. The specific MEK-1 kinase inhibitor, PD98059, inhibited all the effects of increasing [Ca2+]i, indicating that the MAPK/ERK pathway activation is essential for TF-1 cell survival and proliferation. Based on these results we suggest that the elevation of the [Ca2+]i may influence the cytokine dependence of hemopoietic progenitors and may contribute to pathological hematopoiesis.","['Apati, Agota', 'Janossy, Judit', 'Brozik, Anna', 'Bauer, Pal Imre', 'Magocsi, Maria']","['Apati A', 'Janossy J', 'Brozik A', 'Bauer PI', 'Magocsi M']","['Department of Cell Metabolism, National Medical Centre, Institute of Haematology and Immunology, Dioszegi ut 64, Budapest H-1113, Hungary.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', '*MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/20 04:00,2003/05/15 05:00,['2003/03/20 04:00'],"['2003/03/20 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/05/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/20 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.m205528200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)71295-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2003 Mar 14;278(11):9235-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.m205528200.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, polysomies and point mutations can also alter AML1 function. AML1, also called CBF alpha 2, PEBP alpha 2 or RUNX1, is thus implicated in a great number of acute leukemias via a variety of pathogenic mechanisms and seems to act either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor gene. Characterization of AML1 knockout mice has shown that AML1 is necessary for normal development of all hematopoietic lineages and alterations in the overal functional level of AML1 can have a profound effect on hematopoiesis. Numerous studies have shown that AML1 plays a vital role in the regulation of expression of many genes involved in hematopoietic cell development, and the impairment of AML1 function disregulates the pathways leading to cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, heterozygous AML1 mutations alone may not be sufficient for the development of leukemia. A cumulative process of mutagenesis involving additional genetic events in functionally related molecules, may be necessary for the development of leukemia and may determine the leukemic phenotype. We review the known AML1 target genes, AML1 interacting proteins, AML1 gene alterations and their effects on AML1 function, and mutations in AML1-related genes associated with leukemia.

We exposed cells to ultraviolet light (UV-C) and imaged the nuclear distribution of PML, p53, and the BLM helicase by confocal microscopy. After DNA damage, PML partially relocated out of the PML-NBs, and colocalized with BLM and p53 at sites of DNA repair.

PML conversely interferes with viral replication. We demonstrate that PML acts as a coactivator for the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoprotein without direct binding. Tax was identified within interchromatin granule clusters (IGCs)/RNA splicing bodies (SBs), not PML-NBs; Tax expression did not affect PML-NB formation. Moreover, PML and CBP/p300 cooperatively activated Tax-mediated HTLV-1-LTR-dependent gene expression. Interestingly, two PML mutants, PML-RAR and PMLDelta216-331, which fail to form PML-NBs, could also coactivate Tax-mediated trans-acting function but had no effect on retinoic acid receptor (RAR)- or p53-dependent gene expression. In contrast, SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptors), a nuclear corepressor found within the matrix-associated deacetylase (MAD) nuclear body, relocalized into Tax-associated nuclear bodies upon coexpression with Tax. SMRT coactivated the trans-acting function of Tax through direct binding. Coexpression of SMRT and PML resulted in an additive activation of Tax trans-acting function.

Furthermore, p19(ARF) also encoded by the CDKN2A locus, has been shown to regulate positively the p53 pathway leading to growth arrest and apoptosis. All three genes have been inactivated in human tumors. In myeloid cells, p15(INK4b) mRNA is upregulated during cytokine-induced differentiation and/or growth arrest, and hypermethylation of the p15(INK4b) gene promoter region is a common event in acute myeloid leukemia. In the present study, we examined murine monocyte/macrophage tumors with deregulated c-myc for evidence of Ink4 gene inactivation. p15(Ink4b) mRNA and protein were detected in the majority of leukemias, and p16(Ink4a) mRNA and protein were highly expressed in two of them. pRb was in a hypophosphorylated state in most of the neoplasms indicating that the Cdk inhibitors that were expressed in the cells were functional. The observed expression of p15(Ink4b) is inconsistent with their proliferation state, although it might be expected to be expressed owing to the maturity of the cells. These data suggest, therefore, that deregulated c-Myc bypasses the pRb restriction point and cell cycle arrest in these tumors. An examination of p19(Arf) exons revealed deletions of the gene in up to 94% of the tumors. Since this gene shares exon 2 with p16(Ink4a), it is often difficult to determine which gene is the relevant tumor suppressor. However, the loss of only the p19(Arf)-specific exon 1 beta was observed in a tumor that had normal p16(Ink4a) protein expression. In addition, the p19(Arf)-specific exon was deleted in another tumor that expressed a functional chimeric protein, p15Ex1-p16Ex2-3; it was demonstrated here that this fusion protein is capable of inducing G1 arrest. These data overall supports the hypothesis that the critical inactivation event in these hematopoietic neoplasms is elimination of p19(Arf), and not Ink4 function.","['Haviernik, Peter', 'Schmidt, Martina', 'Hu, Xinrong', 'Wolff, Linda']","['Haviernik P', 'Schmidt M', 'Hu X', 'Wolff L']","['Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892-4255, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*physiology', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF/*genetics', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/04/23 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/23 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/sj.onc.1206268 [doi]', '1206268 [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2003 Mar 20;22(11):1600-10. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1206268.,,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cdkn2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Smac functions by eliminating the caspase-inhibitory properties of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAP), particularly XIAP. In this study, we stably transfected both full-length (FL) and mature (MT) Smac genes into the K562 and CEM leukaemic cell lines. Both FL and MT Smac transfectants increased the sensitivity of leukaemic cells to UV light-induced apoptosis and the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. Purified cytosol from the mature Smac transfectants, or the addition of human recombinant Smac protein or N-7 peptide into nontransfected cytosol, showed an increased sensitivity to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. The mature Smac enhanced the susceptibility of both K562 and CEM cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the mature Smac protein also inhibited proliferation, as detected by reduced colony formation and Ki-67 expression in leukaemic cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that Smac transfectants displayed significant G0/G1 arrest and reduction in 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Smac sensitized human acute myeloid leukaemia blasts to cytochrome c-induced activation of caspase-3. However, Smac failed to overcome Apaf-1-deficiency-mediated resistance to cytochrome c in primary leukaemic blasts. In summary, this study reveals that Smac/DIABLO exhibits a potential role in increasing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation in human leukaemic cells. Importantly, it also indicates that it is crucial to evaluate the levels of Apaf-1 and XIAP proteins in patient samples before using Smac peptide therapy in the treatment of human leukaemia.","['Jia, Li', 'Patwari, Yasmeen', 'Kelsey, Stephen M', 'Srinivasula, Srinivasa M', 'Agrawal, Samir G', 'Alnemri, Emad S', 'Newland, Adrian C']","['Jia L', 'Patwari Y', 'Kelsey SM', 'Srinivasula SM', 'Agrawal SG', 'Alnemri ES', 'Newland AC']","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, St Bartholomew's, The Royal School of Medicine and Dentistry, London El 2AD, UK.

Coexposure of K562 cells to UCN-01 (e.g., 100 nM) or U0126 (30 microM) resulted in a marked increase in mitochondrial injury (e.g., release of cytochrome c; loss of deltapsi(m)) and apoptosis. Similar results were obtained in other Bcr/Abl(+) cells (e.g., LAMA 84, BV-173) and with other MEK1/2 inhibitors (e.g., PD184352). Exposure of K562 cells to UCN-01 resulted in activation of ERK, an effect that was abrogated by co-administration of MEK1/2 inhibitors. Coadminstration of UCN-01 with U0126 produced multiple perturbations in signal transduction/cell cycle regulatory pathways, including diminished expression of Bcr/Abl, Mcl-1, cylin D(1), and activation of JNK and p34(cdc2). Coadministration of the JNK inhibitor SP600125 attenuated UCN-01/MEK inhibitor- associated lethality, suggesting a functional role for JNK activation in enhanced lethality. Finally, UCN-01 and MEK1/2 inhibitors effectively induced apoptosis in Bcr/Abl(+) cells (e.g., K562 and LAMA 84) overexpressing Bcr/Abl and resistant to STI571. These findings indicate that BcrAbl(+) leukemia cells are sensitive to a strategy combining UCN-01 with MEK/ERK inhibitors that simultaneously disrupts two signaling pathways.","['Yu, Chunrong', 'Dai, Yun', 'Dent, Paul', 'Grant, Steven']","['Yu C', 'Dai Y', 'Dent P', 'Grant S']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University/Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,IM,"['Alkaloids/administration & dosage', 'Anthracenes/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage', 'Blotting, Western', 'Butadienes/administration & dosage', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/drug effects/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 2', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nitriles/administration & dosage', 'Piperazines', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/06/17 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/17 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['319 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.319 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Nov-Dec;1(6):674-82. doi: 10.4161/cbt.319.,,"['0 (2-(2-chloro-4-iodophenylamino)-N-cyclopropylmethoxy-3,4-difluorobenzamide)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Anthracenes)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Butadienes)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (U 0126)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', '1TW30Y2766 (pyrazolanthrone)', '7BU5H4V94A (7-hydroxystaurosporine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (MAP2K2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP2K1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,['Cancer Biol Ther. 2002 Nov-Dec;1(6):683-4.

The introduction of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic compounds, especially arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)), has provided good models to study not only differentiation and/or apoptosis therapy but also molecular target-based cancer treatment. In vivo and in vitro investigations have shown that both agents are able to induce differentiation of APL cells: ATRA tends to induce terminal differentiation, while low-dose As(2)O(3) can induce partial differentiation. Significant progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanisms of APL pathogenesis and differentiation therapy. Pharmacological concentrations (0.1 approximately 1 microM) of ATRA derepresses transcription by releasing CoR from, and recruiting CoA to PML-RARalpha, whereas As(2)O(3) triggers a rapid degradation of PML-RARalpha. In fact, the two drugs act on the same oncoprotein through targeting different moieties and in distinct ways and thereby abrogate its dominant-negative effects on regulatory pathways necessary for granulocytic differentiation. As to apoptosis, it is clear that high-dose As(2)O(3) can induce mitochondria-mediated cell death pathway in a thiol-dependent manner, while the mechanism of ATRA-induced apoptosis needs further elucidation. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis are also expected to find new molecular targets.

To elucidate the possible role(s) of NF-kappa B in erythroid gene regulation and erythropoiesis, we have carried out transient transfection studies of the human embryonic/fetal erythroid cell line K562 and mouse adult erythroid MEL cells. It is shown that tumor necrosis factor-alpha represses the transcription activity directed by either alpha or zeta globin promoter in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, different NF-kappa B family members could effectively repress the transfected alpha-like globin promoters in K562 as well as in MEL cells. The involvement of NF-kappa B pathway is supported by the ability of a NF-kappa B-specific, dominant negative mutant to block the tumor necrosis factor-alpha or p65-mediated suppression of the alpha-like globin promoter activities. The suppression appears to be mediated through cis-linked HS-40 enhancer. Finally, stably transfected K562 cells overexpressing p65 contain reduced amounts of the p45/NF-E2 RNA and functional NF-E2 proteins. Our studies have identified a new set of targets of NF-kappa B. We suggest that the relatively high activity of the NF-kappa B pathway in early erythroid progenitors is involved in the suppression of erythroid-specific genes.

Over the last few years, it has been established that the X-RARalpha fusion proteins play a key role in the pathogenesis of APL through recruitment of co-repressors and the histone deacetylase (HDAC)-complex to repress genes implicated in myeloid differentiation. Paradoxically, the X-RARalpha fusion protein has the potential to mediate myeloid differentiation at pharmacological doses of its ligand (all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)), which is dependent on the dissociation of the HDAC/co-repressor complex. Arsenic compounds have also been shown to be promising therapeutic agents, leading to differentiation and apoptosis of APL blasts. It is now apparent that the nature of the RARalpha-fusion partner is a critical determinant of response to ATRA and arsenic, underlining the importance of cytogenetic and molecular characterisation of patients with suspected APL to determine the most appropriate treatment approach. Standard protocols involving ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy, lead to cure of approximately 70% patients with PML-RARalpha-associated APL. Patients at high risk of relapse can be identified by minimal residual disease monitoring. The challenge for future studies is to improve complete remission rates through reduction of induction deaths, particularly due to haemorrhage, identification of patients at high risk of relapse who would benefit from additional therapy, and identification of a favourable-risk group, for which treatment intensity could be reduced, thereby reducing risks of treatment toxicity and development of secondary leukaemia/myelodysplasia. With the advent of ATRA and arsenic, APL has already provided the first example of successful molecularly targeted therapy; it is hoped that with further understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease, the next decade will yield further improvements in the outlook for these patients.","['Mistry, Anita R', 'Pedersen, Eva W', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Grimwade, David']","['Mistry AR', 'Pedersen EW', 'Solomon E', 'Grimwade D']","[""Division of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Guy's, King's and St Thomas' School of Medicine, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Translocation, Genetic']",265,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/11/13 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/11/13 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0268960X02000759 [pii]', '10.1016/s0268-960x(02)00075-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 2003 Jun;17(2):71-97. doi: 10.1016/s0268-960x(02)00075-9.,,"['0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)']",,,['Copyright 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined morphological changes in the marrow and peripheral blood of 27 patients with chronic phase (CP), accelerated phase (AP) and blastic phase (BP) CML, 3 and 6 months after treatment with imatinib. At 3 months there was a significant clearance of leukaemic cells as evidenced by a complete haematological response (CHR) in the peripheral blood in 25 patients, together with reduced marrow cellularity in 25 (median reduction CP 42%; AP/BP 68%) and a reduction in the number of megakaryocytes (13 of 18 CP: five of six AP/BP; three patients did not have an assessable marrow) with an increase in the amount of normal megakaryopoiesis. After 6 months, there was continued morphological improvement in eight of 17 CP patients (one patient died after 3 months) with continued cytogenetic response (7 out of 15 patients with assessable metaphases had no abnormal Ph+ cells and three had <35% Ph+ cells) and maintenance of haematologic response in all patients. After an initial response to treatment at 3 months in the AP/BP group, with CHR and a reduction in cellularity in all patients, we found morphological evidence of a loss of response to treatment, with an increase in leukaemic cells, as evidenced by loss of CHR in three of nine and an increase in median cellularity in five patients. No patient in this group achieved a complete cytogenetic response. In summary, in CML-CP patients treated with 6 months of imatinib, there was a significant reduction in leukaemic cells as evidenced by a haematolological response in the peripheral blood, together with reduced marrow cellularity, restoration of morphologically normal haemopoiesis and a meaningful cytogenetic response. Maintaining a response to treatment appeared less likely to occur in the AP/BP group patients, especially those who did not achieve any cytogenetic response to treatment.","['McNamara, C', 'Grigg, A', 'Szer, J', 'Roberts, A', 'Campbell, L', 'Hoyt, R', 'Lynch, K', 'Juneja, S']","['McNamara C', 'Grigg A', 'Szer J', 'Roberts A', 'Campbell L', 'Hoyt R', 'Lynch K', 'Juneja S']","['Department of Diagnostic Haematology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, VIC, Australia. chris.mcnamara@mh.org.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Drug Resistance', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/drug therapy/genetics', 'Megakaryocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Piperazines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Reticulin/blood', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['497 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00497.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Apr;25(2):119-25. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00497.x.,,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reticulin)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assay system for quantifying the proviral copy level was sensitive, accurate, and reproducible over a wide range of density from 100 to 0.1% with a coefficient of variation (%) of 4.5 to 9.6. The proviral load of the healthy carriers and patients with ATL was 301 +/- 339 copies per 10(4) MNC (3 +/- 3.4%) on average and varied depending on the ATL cell number and the SBH band-status of single or multiple bands. In ATL cases with multiple bands detected by SBH analysis, their ATL cells were shown to harbor multiple copies within one ATL cell, so that the corrected copy number interpolated by the band number in SBH was closely equivalent to the expected ATL cell number in PB, corresponding to the virus-infected cell burden. The proviral load in healthy carriers ranged from 0.1 to 15% of PB-MNC, and, in combination with the fraction (%) of ATL-like flower cells defined by PB smear morphology, enabled carriers to be subgrouped into three categories. This result indicates that the detection of proviral load by(RT) PCR is sufficient and relevant to monitor the infected cell number in the PB and to evaluate the HTLV-1 pathologic status.","['Kamihira, S', 'Dateki, N', 'Sugahara, K', 'Hayashi, T', 'Harasawa, H', 'Minami, S', 'Hirakata, Y', 'Yamada, Y']","['Kamihira S', 'Dateki N', 'Sugahara K', 'Hayashi T', 'Harasawa H', 'Minami S', 'Hirakata Y', 'Yamada Y']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Sakamoto, Nagasaki City, Japan. kamihira@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier State/blood/virology', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Gene Dosage', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/blood/virology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/blood/virology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Proviruses/*genetics/growth & development', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Time Factors', '*Viral Load']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/12/03 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/12/03 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']","['503 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00503.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2003 Apr;25(2):111-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2003.00503.x.,,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A focus group of healthy adolescents was held at a location away from the hospital to gain the perspectives of healthy adolescents. No disadvantages of a more centralized model of care for adolescents were discovered. The particular feature felt to be important was the expertise of the staff rather than the physical environment. Some suboptimal care was identified in referring units, though this appeared to apply to that associated with the treatment of solid tumours rather than leukaemias.

However, no data are available on how arsenite inhibits PDH activity in human cells. The IC(50) values for arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) to inhibit the PDH activity in porcine heart pure enzyme preparation and in human leukemia cell line HL60 cells were estimated to be 182 and 2 microM, respectively. Thus, As(2)O(3) inactivation of PDH activity was about 90 times more potent in HL60 cells than in purified enzyme preparation. The IC(50) values for As(2)O(3) and phenylarsine oxide to reduce the vicinal thiol content in HL60 cells were estimated to be 81.7 and 1.9 microM, respectively. Thus, As(2)O(3) is a potent PDH inhibitor but a weak vicinal thiol reacting agent in HL60 cells. Antioxidants but not dithiol compounds suppressed As(2)O(3) inhibition of PDH activity in HL60 cells. Conversely, dithiol compounds but not antioxidants suppressed the inhibition of PDH activity by phenylarsine oxide. As(2)O(3) increased H(2)O(2) level in HL60 cells, but this was not observed for phenylarsine oxide. Mitochondrial respiration inhibitors suppressed the As(2)O(3)-induced H(2)O(2) production and As(2)O(3) inhibition of PDH activity. Moreover, metal chelators ameliorated whereas Fenton metals aggravated As(2)O(3) inhibition of PDH activity. Treatment with H(2)O(2) plus Fenton metals also decreased the PDH activity in HL60 cells. Therefore, it seems that As(2)O(3) elevates H(2)O(2) production in mitochondria and this may produce hydroxyl through the Fenton reaction and result in oxidative damage to the protein of PDH. The present results suggest that arsenite may cause protein oxidation to inactivate an enzyme and this can occur at a much lower concentration than arsenite binding directly to the critical thiols.","['Samikkannu, Thangavel', 'Chen, Chien-Hung', 'Yih, Ling-Huei', 'Wang, Alexander S S', 'Lin, Shu-Yu', 'Chen, Tsen-Chien', 'Jan, Kun-Yan']","['Samikkannu T', 'Chen CH', 'Yih LH', 'Wang AS', 'Lin SY', 'Chen TC', 'Jan KY']","['Institute of Zoology, Academia Sinica, Taipei 11529, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Copper Sulfate/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Ferrous Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/analysis/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects/enzymology', 'Myocardium/enzymology', 'NADPH Oxidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oxides/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Swine']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx025615j [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2003 Mar;16(3):409-14. doi: 10.1021/tx025615j.,,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Ferrous Compounds)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '0HUR2WY345 (oxophenylarsine)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'LRX7AJ16DT (Copper Sulfate)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The resulting ID(50) values are then used to formulate a quantitative structure-activity relationship, which is well-correlated by the Brown variation of the Hammett electronic parameter, sigma-plus (sigma(+) ), such that Log 1/ID(50) = -0.93 (+/-0.18) sigma(+) + 0.86 (+/-0.24) I(H) + 3.99 (+/-0.13). I(H) represents an indicator variable that calls attention to the unusual activity of halogens and pseudohalogens. In lieu of sigma(+), homolytic bond dissociation energies (BDE) are also used successfully to correlate the cellular cytotoxicities of thiophenols. The nature of substituent effects on cellular toxicity is examined, and they reveal that electron-releasing substituted thiophenols such as 4-amino thiophenol and the 4-alkoxy thiophenols are highly cytotoxic and effective at inhibiting cellular proliferation at physiological pH. On the other hand, electron-attracting substituted thiophenols such as the 4-cyano and 4-halogen analogues show a reduced ability to inhibit the cell growth of this cell line. Thus, there is a clear parallel between enhanced biological activity and electron releasing ability as measured by sigma(+) constants or BDE values. The susceptibility of the cellular interaction to electronic effects as delineated by the coefficient with the sigma(+) term (also called the Hammett rho value) is high (-0.96), suggesting that substantial energetic assistance is provided by the substituents and that a weak initiating radical reactant such as superoxide radical may be involved. Previous cytotoxicity studies of a large diverse data set of X-phenols in this cell line and embryo cells have also revealed a more pronounced dependence on sigma(+) and deltaBDE. A comparison of reaction constants obtained from thiophenoxy radical formation reactions and phenoxy radical formation reactions in organic media suggests radical-mediated involvement in cell cytotoxicity. Such cells could be more vulnerable to the effects of reactive thiyl species on their metabolism and subsequent proliferation.","['Verma, Rajeshwar P', 'Kapur, Sanjay', 'Barberena, Omar', 'Shusterman, Alan', 'Hansch, Corwin H', 'Selassie, Cynthia D']","['Verma RP', 'Kapur S', 'Barberena O', 'Shusterman A', 'Hansch CH', 'Selassie CD']","['Department of Chemistry, Pomona College, Claremont, California 91711, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrons', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Phenols/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Sulfhydryl Compounds/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Thermodynamics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/19 04:00,2003/10/15 05:00,['2003/03/19 04:00'],"['2003/03/19 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/10/15 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/19 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/tx020103q [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2003 Mar;16(3):276-84. doi: 10.1021/tx020103q.,['1R01ES 07595-0/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (Phenols)', '0 (Sulfhydryl Compounds)', '7K011JR4T0 (thiophenol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Logistic regression was used to relate risk to measures of community infections (measles, respiratory and other infections) in 3 prenatal and 2 postnatal quarters. There was an increased risk of Hodgkin's disease among children exposed around birth to higher levels of measles (odds ratio for trend = 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3-4.2, p = 0.01). For other diagnostic groups, there was no consistent evidence of an association between risk and exposure to infections.

We studied the demographics and response to treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) between 1989 and 2000 in Teresina, Piau , and compared these results with reports from Brazil and other countries. Complete data concerning 345 patients (230 ALL, 115 AML) were reviewed. AML occurred predominantly in adults (77%), with a median age of 34 years, similar to that found in the southeast of Brazil but lower than the median age in the United States and Europe (52 years). FAB distribution was similar in children and adults and FAB-M2 was the most common type, as also found in Japan. The high frequency of FAB-M3 described in most Brazilian studies and for Hispanics in the United States was not observed. Overall survival for adults was 40%, similar to other studies in Brazil. A high mortality rate was observed during induction. No clinical or hematological parameter influenced survival in the Cox model. ALL presented the characteristic peak of incidence between 2-8 years. Most of the cases were CD10+ pre-B ALL. In 25%, abnormal expression of myeloid antigens was observed. Only 10% of the patients were older than 30 years. Overall survival was better for children. Age and leukocyte count were independent prognostic factors. These data demonstrate that, although there are regional peculiarities, the application of standardized treatments and good supportive care make it possible to achieve results observed in other countries for the same chemotherapy protocols.","['Rego, M F N', 'Pinheiro, G S', 'Metze, K', 'Lorand-Metze, I']","['Rego MF', 'Pinheiro GS', 'Metze K', 'Lorand-Metze I']","['Departamento de Clinica Medica, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade Federal do Piaui, Teresina, PI, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Braz J Med Biol Res,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologicas,8112917,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brazil/epidemiology', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,2003/03/18 04:00,2003/06/27 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/06/27 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['S0100-879X2003000300007 [pii]', '10.1590/s0100-879x2003000300007 [doi]']",ppublish,Braz J Med Biol Res. 2003 Mar;36(3):331-7. doi: 10.1590/s0100-879x2003000300007.

Many adverse factors including social and economic limitations may reduce the overall results of this complex and expensive procedure. Our objective was to characterize the most important clinical, social and economic features of candidates for transplantation and their potential donors as well as the influence of these factors on overall survival in a retrospective and exploratory analysis at a university hospital. From July 1993 to July 2001, candidates for BMT were referred to the Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit by Hematology and Oncology Centers from several regions of Brazil. A total of 1138 patients were referred to us as candidates for alloBMT. Median age was 25 years (range: 2 months-60 years), 684 (60.1%) were males and 454 (39.9%) were females. The clinical indications were severe aplastic anemia and hematological malignancies. From the total of 1138 patients, 923 had HLA-typing; 497/923 (53.8%) candidates had full match donors; 352/1138 (30.8%) were eligible for alloBMT. Only 235 of 352 (66.7%) were transplanted. Schooling was 1st to 8th grade for 123/235 (52.3%); monthly family income ranged from US$60 (7%) to more than US$400 (36%). Overall survival for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, severe aplastic anemia and acute myeloid leukemia was 58, 60 and 30%, respectively. Thus, overall survival rates for the most frequent hematological diseases were similar to those reported in the International Registry, except for acute myeloid leukemia.

Also, coinfection with HIV-1 and HTLV type I (HTLV-I) occurs more frequently. There is little or no information on the effects of opiates (i.e., morphine) on HTLV infection alone or on coinfection of HTLV-I-infected cells with HIV-1. Therefore, in this report, we analyzed the in vitro effects of morphine on HIV or HTLV infection alone as well as on dual infection with HTLV-I and HIV-1. Morphine decreased the in vitro levels of interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) and IL-2 during single infections, and this effect was reversed by the addition of the opioid antagonist naloxone. In contrast, treatment with morphine resulted in a 31% and 36% increase in IFN gamma and IL-2 levels, respectively, during dual infection. In addition, naloxone had an apparent additive effect on the morphine-associated enhancement of IFN gamma and IL-2 expression in the dual-infection model. Despite the high levels of IFN gamma expression, the viability of the coinfected cells in the presence of morphine was maintained. Importantly, morphine treatment was associated with augmented viral reverse transcription activity in dually infected cultures, apparently to the benefit of HTLV-I. If a similar putative morphine-induced advantage for HTLV-I production also occurs during in vivo coinfection, opiates such as morphine could contribute to the observed increased rate of HIV-1/HTLV-I infection in the IDU population in a more direct fashion than was previously believed.","['Nyland, Susan B', 'Cao, Chuanhai', 'Bai, Yun', 'Loughran, Thomas P', 'Ugen, Kenneth E']","['Nyland SB', 'Cao C', 'Bai Y', 'Loughran TP', 'Ugen KE']","['Department of Medial Microbiology and Immunology, University of South Florida College of Medicine, Tampa, Florida 33612, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes (1999),100892005,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects/*immunology', 'HIV Infections/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*complications/drug therapy/immunology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*blood/genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*blood/genetics', 'Morphine/*pharmacology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,2003/03/18 04:00,2003/04/24 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00126334-200304010-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr. 2003 Apr 1;32(4):406-16. doi: 10.1097/00126334-200304010-00010.,['F31 DA05913/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '76I7G6D29C (Morphine)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a point during G(0)-->G(1) beyond which T cells are committed to enter the cell cycle has not been defined. We define here a G(0)-->G(1) commitment point that occurs 3 to 5 h after CD3 and CD28 stimulation of human CD4 or CD8 T cells. Transition through this point requires cdk6/4-cyclin D, since inhibition with TAT-p16(INK4A) during the first 3 to 5 h prevents cell cycle entry and maintains both naive and memory T cells in G(0). Transition through the G(0)-->G(1) commitment point is also necessary for T cells to increase in size, i.e., to enter the cellular growth cycle. However, transition through this point is not required for the induction of effector functions. These can be initiated while cells are maintained in G(0) with TAT-p16(INK4A). We have termed this quiescent, activated state G(0(A)). Our data provide proof of the principle that entry of T cells into the cell cycle and cellular growth cycles are coupled at the G(0)-->G(1) commitment point but that these processes can be uncoupled from the early expression of molecules of effector functions.","['Lea, Nicholas C', 'Orr, Stephen J', 'Stoeber, Kai', 'Williams, Gareth H', 'Lam, Eric W-F', 'Ibrahim, Mohammad A A', 'Mufti, Ghulam J', 'Thomas, N Shaun B']","['Lea NC', 'Orr SJ', 'Stoeber K', 'Williams GH', 'Lam EW', 'Ibrahim MA', 'Mufti GJ', 'Thomas NS']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, Leukaemia Sciences Laboratories, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, London SE5 9NU, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Antibodies/pharmacology', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD3 Complex/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'G1 Phase/drug effects/physiology', 'Gene Products, tat/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/physiology', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects/physiology', 'Transduction, Genetic/methods']",,2003/03/18 04:00,2003/04/05 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/05 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.23.7.2351-2361.2003 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2003 Apr;23(7):2351-61. doi: 10.1128/MCB.23.7.2351-2361.2003.,,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Gene Products, tat)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,PMC150729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the current study was to investigate the role of NNT-1/BSF-3 in corticotroph cell function and further characterize NNT-1/BSF-3 signaling pathways. Using RT-PCR, expression of ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor alpha, leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, and gp130 could be demonstrated in mRNA derived from murine corticotroph AtT-20 cells and murine pituitary tissue. Incubation of AtT-20 cells with 10 ng/ml recombinant human NNT-1/BSF-3 rapidly induced tyrosine-phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 and STAT1 at 5 and 10 min. Proopiomelanocortin promoter activity and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3 promoter activity were significantly stimulated by NNT-1/BSF-3 4.0 +/- 0.3- and 5.9 +/- 0.2-fold, respectively. In comparison with untreated control, NNT-1/BSF-3 significantly stimulated ACTH secretion at 24 and 48 h 1.7 +/- 0.2-fold and 1.5 +/- 0.1-fold above baseline. In comparison with mock-transfected cells, stable overexpression of SOCS-3 in AtT-20 cells abolished NNT-1/BSF-3-induced STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation and almost completely inhibited STAT-dependent proopiomelanocortin promoter and SOCS-3 promoter activities. In addition, NNT-1/BSF-3-induced ACTH secretion at 48 h was significantly attenuated by SOCS-3 overexpression. In summary, we have shown that NNT-1/BSF-3 is a modulator of corticotroph cell function, which is negatively regulated by SOCS-3. Our data indicate that the activation of the Jak-STAT cascade is essential for corticotroph NNT-1/BSF-3 signaling. Further studies will have to investigate the possible in vivo role of NNT-1/BSF-3 as a neuroimmunoendocrine modulator of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis stress response.","['Auernhammer, Christoph J', 'Isele, Nicola B', 'Kopp, Florian B', 'Spoettl, Gerald', 'Cengic, Neziha', 'Weber, Matthias M', 'Senaldi, Giorgio', 'Engelhardt, Dieter']","['Auernhammer CJ', 'Isele NB', 'Kopp FB', 'Spoettl G', 'Cengic N', 'Weber MM', 'Senaldi G', 'Engelhardt D']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Munich 81366, Germany. christoph.auernhammer@med2.med.uni-muenchen.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Endocrinology,Endocrinology,0375040,IM,"['Adrenocorticotropic Hormone/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics', 'Neuroimmunomodulation/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pituitary Gland/*cytology/physiology', 'Pro-Opiomelanocortin/genetics', 'Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Repressor Proteins', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein', 'Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors']",,2003/03/18 04:00,2003/04/11 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/04/11 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/en.2002-220933 [doi]'],ppublish,Endocrinology. 2003 Apr;144(4):1202-10. doi: 10.1210/en.2002-220933.,,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SOCS3 protein, human)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 3 Protein)', '0 (Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (cardiotrophin-like cytokine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '66796-54-1 (Pro-Opiomelanocortin)', '9002-60-2 (Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, TIMP must be regarded as multifunctional proteins involved in cell growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms induced by TIMP remain largely unknown. In the present study, we provide evidence that TIMP-1 induces a significant anti-apoptotic effect in the human erythroleukaemic cell line UT-7 and in the murine myeloid cell line 32D. Using specific kinases inhibitors, we show that TIMP-1-mediated cell survival is dependent upon Janus kinase (JAK) 2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activities. By transient transfection of dominant-negative Akt in UT-7 cells, we demonstrate that this kinase is crucial for the TIMP-1 anti-apoptotic effect. Moreover, TIMP-1 enhances specific phosphorylation of both Akt and Bad (Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L)-antagonist, causing cell death) in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner and, besides, controls the level of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-X(L). We conclude that TIMP-1 induces haematopoietic cell survival via the JAK2/PI 3-kinase/Akt/Bad pathway.","['Lambert, Elise', 'Boudot, Cedric', 'Kadri, Zahra', 'Soula-Rothhut, Mahdhia', 'Sowa, Marie-Line', 'Mayeux, Patrick', 'Hornebeck, William', 'Haye, Bernard', 'Petitfrere, Emmanuelle']","['Lambert E', 'Boudot C', 'Kadri Z', 'Soula-Rothhut M', 'Sowa ML', 'Mayeux P', 'Hornebeck W', 'Haye B', 'Petitfrere E']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, CNRS FRE-2534, IFR53 Biomolecules, UFR Sciences Exactes et Naturelles et UFR Medecine, BP 1039, Universite de Reims Champagne-Ardenne, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Myeloid Cells/cytology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1/metabolism/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Transfection']",,2003/03/18 04:00,2003/07/24 05:00,['2003/03/18 04:00'],"['2003/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2003/03/04 00:00 [revised]', '2003/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [pubmed]', '2003/07/24 05:00 [medline]', '2003/03/18 04:00 [entrez]']","['10.1042/BJ20030187 [doi]', 'BJ20030187 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 2003 Jun 15;372(Pt 3):767-74. doi: 10.1042/BJ20030187.,,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-1)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Jak2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,PMC1223442,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
