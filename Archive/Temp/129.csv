However, there are no validated biomarkers that allow the identification of those patients at greatest risk. With the objective of identifying such predictors, cerebrospinal fluid collected from 53 patients over 2.5 years of therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia was retrospectively studied. Cerebrospinal fluid folate, concentrated relative to serum folate prior to therapy, dropped during the first month of therapy and remained below baseline throughout treatment. Cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine was inversely related to cognitive function prior to treatment. Oral methotrexate was associated with decreased cerebrospinal fluid folate and increased cerebrospinal fluid homocysteine, but these changes were not seen with oral aminopterin. Of 36 patients who had imaging after completion of therapy, 9 had periventricular or subcortical white matter abnormalities consistent with leukoencephalopathy. Peak cerebrospinal fluid tau concentrations during therapy were higher among patients who had leukoencephalopathy after completion of therapy than among those with normal imaging studies at the end of therapy. If confirmed prospectively, these markers may allow the identification of those patients at greatest risk of developing treatment-induced neurocognitive dysfunction, thus guiding preventive interventions.","['Department of Pediatrics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA. pcole@aecom.yu.edu']","['S0887-8994(08)00428-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pediatrneurol.2008.09.005 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of action of this antitumor agent have been studied by several investigators. Here, we explore the underlying mechanisms of bortezomib-induced apoptosis in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) at the level of mitochondrial membrane injury. In all cell lines including (KMS-12-PE [MM], HUT78 [CTCL], ATN1 [ATLL], and MT4 [ATLL]), antiapoptotic factors such as c-Flip and XIAP were downregulated after exposure to bortezomib, probably via inhibition of nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. In addition, among the members of the BH3-only family, upregulation of Noxa was consistently seen at both the transcriptional and protein levels in a p53-independent manner after exposure to bortezomib. Repression of Noxa by small interfering RNA partially rescued CTCL and ATLL cells from bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Immunoprecipitation assays indicated time-dependent binding of Noxa and Mcl-1 in all cell types, suggesting that functional repression of Mcl-1 led to the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane potential. Similar results were also obtained in primary tumor cells from patients with ATLL. Taken together, we conclude that bortezomib-induced apoptosis in ATLL and CTCL cells at least partly depends on the upregulation of Noxa and functional repression of Mcl-1, as is also the case in MM and malignant melanoma.","['Department of Medical Oncology and Immunology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 1 Kawasumi, Mizuho-chou, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.']","['CAS1038 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01038.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment for ITR after BMT generally consists of a combination of local irradiation, orchiectomy, and systemic chemotherapy. However, the effectiveness of these modalities has not been established. Both irradiation and systemic chemotherapy including a second transplantation would result in additional toxicity. In this report we describe a boy with ITR 91 months after BMT who has remained in complete remission more than two yr after a unilateral orchiectomy. We did not treat this patient with systemic chemotherapy, as his ITR developed very late. Our experience suggests that orchiectomy alone is a reasonable option for very late ITR after BMT.","['Department of Pediatrics, Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan. yuichik@m.kufm.kagoshima-u.ac.jp']","['PTR1023 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.01023.x [doi]']",20091126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BK nephropathy has only been reported in a few patients after HCT, most being adult patients, and the single reported pediatric case had evidence of hemorrhagic cystitis. The response to antiviral therapy also seems to differ widely. Here, we describe two cases of BK nephropathy in the native kidneys of HCT recipients exposed to high levels of immunosuppression because of GVHD. Neither of our patients had any evidence of hemorrhagic cystitis. We present definitive renal pathology and detailed chronological evidence of the rising serum creatinine with simultaneous serum and urine BK PCR titers. In one of our cases, antiviral therapy did not seem beneficial as documented by continued renal dysfunction and elevated serum/urine BK PCR titers. Based on our report, intense immunosuppression in pediatric HCT recipients seems to be involved in the activation of BK virus and BK nephropathy should be suspected even in the absence of hematuria in HCT recipients with unexplained renal dysfunction.","[""Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital, Seattle, WA 98105, USA. priya.verghese@seattlechildrens.org""]","['PTR1069 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1399-3046.2008.01069.x [doi]']",20081101,"['K23 DK063038/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 DK063038-05/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL036444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 DK 63038/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2802860,['NIHMS156009'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients are children or young adults, with a median age of 10 yr for children and 28 for adults. There is a male preponderance, particularly in patients with Down syndrome (DS) or in children with concomitant t(9;22)(q34;q11). The median blood values are hemoglobin 72 g/L, platelets 17 x 10(9)/L and white blood cell count 9 x 10(9)/L, with hyperleukocytosis >50 x 10(9)/L having been reported in only approximately 10%.

Both transcript variants can occur simultaneously due to alternative splicing of the b3a2 transcript. Conflicting results have been reported on the influence of the transcripts on haematological findings at diagnosis and the course of the disease in adults while data concerning these topics on childhood CML are still missing. This paper reports on a correlation of BCR/ABL transcript variants with patients' characteristics in childhood CML. DESIGN AND METHODS: Transcript types were determined in 146 paediatric patients with CML enrolled in trial CML-paed-I. Fifty-five patients (38%) expressed b2a2, 53 patients (36%) b3a2 and 38 patients (26%) both transcripts, respectively. These findings were correlated with patients' characteristics (sex, age, WBC, Hb, platelet count, hepatosplenomegaly, etc.) assessed at diagnosis. RESULTS: While the co-expression of both transcripts was evenly distributed among genders [b2a2 + b3a2: 22 females (28%), 16 males (24%)] a highly significant difference (P = 0.007) was found concerning the expression of the b2a2 transcript [34 male (51%) vs. 21 female (27%)] and vice versa of the b3a2 transcript [17 male (25%) vs. 36 female (45%)]. High platelet counts and the combination of high platelet counts in conjunction with pronounced leukocytosis were observed more often in patients expressing the b3a2 transcript. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that in children like in adults specific BCR/ABL transcript types present at diagnosis are associated with distinct haematological alterations (e.g. a high platelet count with the transcript b3a2). However, the sex-dependent skewed distribution of the BCR/ABL transcript types observed so far in this paediatric cohort only deserves further investigation.","['Division of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus, Technical University at Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']","['EJH1170 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01170.x [doi]']",20081110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently two compounds (CGP049090 and PFK115-584) have been identified, which specifically inhibit complexation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1) and lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) leading to transcriptional inactivation of LEF1 in colon carcinoma cell lines. To evaluate the effect of WNT inhibition utilizing theses compounds with regard to their effectivity in AML we treated the AML cell lines Kasumi-1 and HL-60, primary AML blasts and healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with varying concentrations of both substances. Treatment with both compounds for 24 h resulted in a significant killing of AML cell lines and primary AML blasts with 50% effective concentration doses (EC(50)) within the submicromolar range. PBMCs were not significantly affected as indicated by EC(50)-values 100-fold higher than for AML cells. Cell kill was mediated by apoptosis as indicated by induction of caspases 3 and 7 and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) upon treatment. Furthermore, we could show that both compounds substantially decrease expression of CTNNB1/LEF1 target genes c-myc, cyclin D1 and survivin, proofing the specificity of the substances. This was shown in both, AML cell lines and most of the tested primary samples. Our data demonstrate that targeting this pathway seems to be an innovative approach in the treatment of AML.","['Department I of Internal Medicine, University at Cologne, Cologne, Germany.']","['EJH1188 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01188.x [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate here that gambogic acid also present powerful antileukaemic potency through both growth arrest and apoptosis induction in Jurkat cells, which was accompanied by typical apoptotic morphological changes and sharp decreased expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, nucleophosmin, recently demonstrated to be mutated and aberrantly localized in the cytoplasm of leukaemia blasts in a high proportion of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, was over-expressed in Jurkat cells. As the sole site of nucleocytoplasmic communication, the protein components of nuclear pore complex, such as NUP98, NUP88, NUP214 complex, were also deregulated in Jurkat cells. Especially, NUP98 was found to distribute mainly at the cell membrane, while NUP88 and NUP214 situated not just at the nuclear envelope, but also in the cytoplasm. However, in vitro treatment with gambogic acid resulted in significantly reduced expression of nucleophosmin and all three nucleoporins in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, most of NUP88 and NUP214 nucleoporins were relocated to the nuclear rim in the gambogic acid-treated cells. These results suggest that the fact that nucleophosmin and some nucleoporins might act as new targets of gambogic acid, correlates well with the sensitivity to gambogic acid, as well as the rate of apoptosis induced by gambogic acid.

In coastal panchayats, median outdoor radiation levels are more than 4 mGy y-1 and, in certain locations on the coast, it is as high as 70 mGy y-1. Although HBR has been repeatedly shown to increase the frequency of chromosome aberrations in the circulating lymphocytes of exposed persons, its carcinogenic effect is still unproven. A cohort of all 385,103 residents in Karunagappally was established in the 1990's to evaluate health effects of HBR. Based on radiation level measurements, a radiation subcohort consisting of 173,067 residents was chosen. Cancer incidence in this subcohort aged 30-84 y (N = 69,958) was analyzed. Cumulative radiation dose for each individual was estimated based on outdoor and indoor dosimetry of each household, taking into account sex- and age-specific house occupancy factors. Following 69,958 residents for 10.5 years on average, 736,586 person-years of observation were accumulated and 1,379 cancer cases including 30 cases of leukemia were identified by the end of 2005. Poisson regression analysis of cohort data, stratified by sex, attained age, follow-up interval, socio-demographic factors and bidi smoking, showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 Gy-1 (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46). In site-specific analysis, no cancer site was significantly related to cumulative radiation dose. Leukemia was not significantly related to HBR, either. Although the statistical power of the study might not be adequate due to the low dose, our cancer incidence study, together with previously reported cancer mortality studies in the HBR area of Yangjiang, China, suggests it is unlikely that estimates of risk at low doses are substantially greater than currently believed.","['Regional Cancer Center, Trivandrum, Kerala, India. raghurkn@rcctvm.org']","['10.1097/01.HP.0000327646.54923.11 [doi]', '00004032-200901000-00008 [pii]']",,,,,['Health Phys. 2009 Dec;97(6):637-8; author reply 638.

Considering the associated dephosphorylation as a pivotal event in the regulation of cell cycle proteins, we focused on the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, which is regulated in promyelocytic leukemia cells on G-CSF stimulation. SHP-2 was thus found in association with p27(Kip1) and the G-CSF receptor, and we observed a nuclear translocation of SHP-2 on G-CSF stimulation. Using a catalytically inactive form of SHP-2 and siRNA directed against SHP-2, we could demonstrate the involvement of SHP-2 in tyrosine dephosphorylation of p27(Kip1). Moreover, SHP-2 was strongly activated on G-CSF stimulation and specifically dephosphorylated p27(Kip1) in vitro.

We find that 24 hours treatment with either a primarily CDK2-specific, or a primarily CDK7/9-specific, antagonist eliminates proliferative potential even if apoptosis is blocked and the tendency of CDK inhibition to result in DNA damage is overcome by expression of recombinant Chk1. Loss of proliferative potential is correlated with irreversible suppression of biomarkers of cell cycle progression.

In this study, we tested the effect of platonin on human leukemic cells. Treatment with platonin in the dark markedly reduced cell membrane integrity, and induced significant G(0)/G(1) arrest of a panel of human leukemic cell lines, including U937, HL-60, K562, NB4 and THP-1. Development of hypodiploid cells was not evident in these cell lines within 24 h, but was noted in U937, HL-60 and NB4 cells after 24 h. No myeloid differentiation of these cells was noted after five-day treatment. Intriguingly, exposure of monoblastic U937 cells to platonin caused changes characteristic of autophagy, including appearance of cytoplasmic membranous vacuoles and formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) in more than 95% of cells. The platonin-induced autophagy was accompanied by localization of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 to autophagosomes. Pretreatment with pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk abrogated the platonin-induced hypodiploidity, but had no effect on growth inhibition and formation of AVO, indicating a caspase-independent autophagy-associated cell death. Pretreatment of cells with 3-methyladenine attenuated platonin-mediated growth inhibition and formation of AVO. Platonin augmented the expression of BNIP3 in both U937 and K562 cells, whereas had an opposite effect on phosphorylation of mTOR downstream molecule p70S6K. Platonin, at the condition inducing autophagy, induced the mitochondrial membrane permeation. These results suggest that the platonin is capable of inhibiting growth as well as inducing cell death, mainly autophagy-associated, in leukemic cells via a mitochondria-mediated and caspase-independent pathway. A markedly less viability inhibition was noted to human monocytes, the normal counterpart of these myeloid leukemic cells. Platonin, other than a photodynamic agent, may offer significant promise as a therapeutic agent against leukemia.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']","['7360 [pii]', '10.4161/auto.5.2.7360 [doi]']",20090206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed 3 types of whole genome variation: leukemia cell gene expression and somatic copy number variation, and inherited single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes and determined their association with MTXPGs in leukemia cells. Seven genes (FHOD3, IMPA2, ME2, RASSF4, SLC39A6, SMAD2, and SMAD4) displayed all 3 types of genomic variation associated with MTXPGs (P < .05 for gene expression, P < .01 for copy number variation and SNPs): 6 on chromosome 18 and 1 on chromosome 10. Increased chromosome 18 (P = .002) or 10 (P = .036) copy number was associated with MTXPGs even after adjusting for ALL subtype. The expression of the top 7 genes in leukemia cells accounted for more variation in MTXPGs (46%) than did the expression of the top 7 genes in normal HapMap cell lines (20%). The top 7 inherited SNPs in patients accounted for approximately the same degree of variation (17%) in MTXPGs as did the top 7 SNP genotypes in HapMap cell lines (20%). We conclude that acquired genetic variation in leukemia cells has a stronger influence on MTXPG accumulation than inherited genetic variation.","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]","['S0006-4971(20)39176-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-172106 [doi]']",20081209,"['U01 GM061393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'UO1GM61374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'U01GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA078224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA051001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM061374/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2680361,,['Blood. 2009 May 7;113(19):4480-1.

However, the exact role and function of oncogenic KRAS mutations in the initiation and progression of JMML and TLL/L remain elusive. Here, we report the use of a mouse bone marrow transplantation model to study oncogenic Kras-induced leukemogenesis. We show that as the first genetic hit, oncogenic Kras mutations initiate both JMML and TLL/L, but with different efficiencies. Limiting dilution analyses indicated that an oncogenic Kras mutation alone is insufficient to produce frank malignancy. Instead, it cooperates with additional subsequent genetic event(s). Moreover, transplantation of highly purified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors identified HSCs as the primary target for the oncogenic Kras mutation. Karyotypic analysis further indicated that secondary genetic hit(s) target lineage-specific progenitors rather than HSCs for terminal tumor transformation into leukemic stem cells. Thus, we propose the cellular mechanism underlying oncogenic Kras-induced leukemogenesis, with HSCs as the primary target by the oncogenic Kras mutations and lineage-committed progenitors as the final target for cancer stem cell transformation. Our model might be also applicable to other solid tumors harboring oncogenic Kras mutations.","['Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA. zhang@oncology.wisc.edu']","['S0006-4971(20)37754-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-01-134262 [doi]']",20081209,"['P01 HL032262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL 32262/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2637193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that in addition to delaying ulcer healing, trans-resveratrol also aggravated acute gastric ulceration induced by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs by reducing the synthesis of prostaglandin (PG) E(2) via a specific inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 that also hampered angiogenesis. However, for the first time, we showed that the 3'-5'-hydroxylated congener [(E)-HST-1] of trans-resveratrol, synthesized in multigram scale, exerted potential chemotherapeutic property but was nonulcerogenic in nature, rather moderately accelerated healing of indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration. HST-1 did not suppress COX-1, COX-2 expression, and PGE(2) synthesis but reduced the level of inflammatory myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The healing was augmented primarily through the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)-dependent pathway. HST-1 treatment induced endothelial NOS (eNOS) expression and reduced inducible NOS (iNOS), resulting in increased eNOS/iNOS ratio. The selective iNOS inhibitor [L-N(6)-(1-iminoethyl) lysine hydrochloride] and nonselective NOS inhibitor (N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester) treatment revealed that eNOS could be the probable molecular switch to accelerate the indomethacin-induced ulcer healing in HST-1-treated mice. Furthermore, the anticancer effect of HST-1 on U937 and K562 leukemia cell lines was found to be significantly better than that of trans-resveratrol. Overall, these established HST-1 as a potentially better anticancer compound than trans-resveratrol, considering it is devoid of any ulcerogenic side effects. In conclusion, for the first time, we showed that a novel analog of trans-resveratrol, HST-1, was devoid of ulcerogenic adversative effects of trans-resveratrol but retained potentially better anticancer property.","['Department of Biochemistry, Dr. B.C.

Our results clearly point cytoplasmic nucleophosmin (a full predictor of NPM1 mutations) as a new marker for distinguishing NPMc(+) AML and blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm, further clarify the cell of origin of NPMc(+) AML, and justify the inclusion of these pathological conditions as separate entities in the new WHO classification.","['Institute of Pathology, Spedali Civili, University of Brescia, Brescia.']","['haematol.13855 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13855 [doi]']",20081209,,PMC2635411,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2008 Dec 9.,,10.1093/jnci/djn384 [doi],"BACKGROUND: A model that predicts the economic benefit of reduced cancer mortality provides critical information for allocating scarce resources to the interventions with the greatest benefits. METHODS: We developed models using the human capital approach, which relies on earnings as a measure of productivity, to estimate the value of productivity lost as a result of cancer mortality. The base model aggregated age- and sex-specific data from four primary sources: 1) the US Bureau of the Census, 2) US death certificate data for 1999-2003, 3) cohort life tables from the Berkeley Mortality Database for 1900-2000, and 4) the Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey. In a model that included costs of caregiving and household work, data from the National Human Activity Pattern Survey and the Caregiving in the U.S. study were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed using six types of cancer assuming a 1% decline in cancer mortality rates. The values of forgone earnings for employed individuals and imputed forgone earnings for informal caregiving were then estimated for the years 2000-2020. RESULTS: The annual productivity cost from cancer mortality in the base model was approximately $115.8 billion in 2000; the projected value was $147.6 billion for 2020. Death from lung cancer accounted for more than 27% of productivity costs. A 1% annual reduction in lung, colorectal, breast, leukemia, pancreatic, and brain cancer mortality lowered productivity costs by $814 million per year. Including imputed earnings lost due to caregiving and household activity increased the base model total productivity cost to $232.4 billion in 2000 and to $308 billion in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Investments in programs that target the cancers with high incidence and/or cancers that occur in younger, working-age individuals are likely to yield the greatest reductions in productivity losses to society.","['Department of Health Administration, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, 1008 E.

Resistance to glucocorticoids is an important adverse prognostic factor in newly diagnosed ALL patients but its mechanism is unknown. Because SWI/SNF complex-mediated chromatin remodeling is required for glucocorticoid transcriptional activity in vitro, we investigated whether expression of subunits of the SWI/SNF complex was related to glucocorticoid resistance in ALL. METHODS: Gene expression and in vitro sensitivity to prednisolone and dexamethasone were assessed in a training set of primary ALL cells from 177 children with newly diagnosed ALL and a validation set of cells from an independent cohort of 95 ALL patients. The global test method was used to select pathways whose genes were associated with drug sensitivity. Genes involved in chromatin remodeling were identified by use of the Gene Ontology database. Short hairpin RNA (shRNA) was used to knock down mRNA expression of SMARCA4 in glucocorticoid-sensitive Jurkat human ALL cells. Spearman rank correlation, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression were used to investigate associations between gene expression and glucocorticoid sensitivity. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Statistically significant associations between decreased expression in ALL cells of genes for core subunits of the SWI/SNF complex-SMARCA4, ARID1A, and SMARCB1-and resistance to prednisolone and dexamethasone were identified in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, expression of SMARCA4 (P < .001 and r = -0.43), ARID1A (P = .016 and r = -0.29), and SMARCB1 (P = .019 and r = -0.29) in ALL cells was statistically significantly associated with dexamethasone sensitivity, and SMARCA4 expression (P = .018 and r = -0.28) was statistically significantly associated with prednisolone sensitivity. Prednisolone resistance was higher in SMARCA4 shRNA-transfected Jurkat cells (drug concentration lethal to 50% of the leukemia cells [LC(50)] = 277 microM) than in control shRNA-transfected cells (LC(50) = 174 microM, difference = 103 microM, 95% confidence interval of the difference = 100 to 106 microM; P < .001, t test). CONCLUSION: Decreased expression of as many as three subunits of the SWI/SNF complex appears to be associated with glucocorticoid resistance in primary ALL cells.","[""Hematological Malignancies Program, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]","['djn416 [pii]', '10.1093/jnci/djn416 [doi]']",20081209,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 GM61393/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2639326,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as visceral obesity, glucose intolerance, arterial hypertension, and dyslipidemia commonly cluster together as a condition currently known as metabolic syndrome. Thus far, insulin resistance, and endothelial dysfunction are the primary events of the metabolic syndrome. Several groups have recommended clinical criteria for the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in adults. Nonetheless, in what concerns children and adolescents, there are no unified definitions, and modified adult criteria have been suggested by many authors, despite major problems. Some pediatric disease states are at risk for premature cardiovascular disease, with clinical coronary events occurring very early in adult life. Survivors of specific pediatric cancer groups, particularly acute lymphocytic leukemia, central nervous system tumors, sarcomas, lymphomas, testicular cancer, and following bone marrow transplantation, may develop metabolic syndrome traits due to: hormonal deficiencies (growth hormone deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, and gonadal failure), drug or radiotherapy damage, endothelial impairment, physical inactivity, adipose tissue dysfunction, and/or drug-induced magnesium deficiency.

We investigated a possible association between the expression level of MRP1 and the occurrence of MDR in leukemic patients, and we tested the hypothesis that MRP1 polymorphisms are predictive of MDR in patients with acute leukemia. The mRNA level of MRP1 was determined in 111 patients with acute leukemia (including 52 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 59 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia), by quantitative real-time PCR, to determine how it affected the response to chemotherapy. We typed T2684C, C2007T, C2012T, and C2665T MRP1 polymorphisms in 111 patients classified as either drug-resistant or drug-responsive. We found that high expression of MRP1 was associated with the MDR phenotype in both acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.

We found that SRPX2 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and the expression and clinical features showed that high mRNA expression levels were observed in patients with unfavorable outcomes using real-time RT-PCR. The cellular distribution of SRPX2 protein showed the secretion of SRPX2 into extracellular regions and its localization in the cytoplasm. The introduction of the SRPX2 gene into HEK293 cells did not modulate the cellular proliferative activity but did enhance the cellular migration activity, as shown using migration and scratch assays. The conditioned-medium obtained from SRPX2-overexpressing cells increased the cellular migration activity of a gastric cancer cell line, SNU-16. In addition, SRPX2 protein remarkably enhanced the cellular adhesion of SNU-16 and HSC-39 and increased the phosphorylation levels of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), as shown using western blotting, suggesting that SRPX2 enhances cellular migration and adhesion through FAK signaling. In conclusion, the overexpression of SRPX2 enhances cellular migration and adhesion in gastric cancer cells.

This article reviews UCB immunology and addresses the potential therapeutic role of interleukin (IL)-15, a pleiotropic gamma chain signaling cytokine, in modulating immune reconstitution, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft-versus-leukemia effect, and infection susceptibility during the post-UCB transplant period. Cytokine immunotherapy using IL-15 simultaneously modulates several immune compartments, thus holds promise for facilitating post-transplant recovery and augmenting antitumor effect without aggravating GVHD in the setting of UCB transplantation.","[""Division of Asthma, Allergy and Rheumatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan.""]","['906499245 [pii]', '10.1080/08830180802317940 [doi]']",,,,,,106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although trefoil factors have been shown to activate signaling pathways, no cell surface receptor has been directly linked to trefoil peptide signaling. Here we demonstrate the ability of TFF2 peptide to activate signaling via the CXCR4 chemokine receptor in cancer cell lines. We found that both mouse and human TFF2 proteins (at approximately 0.5 microm) activate Ca2+ signaling in lymphoblastic Jurkat cells that could be abrogated by receptor desensitization (with SDF-1alpha) or pretreatment with the specific antagonist AMD3100 or an anti-CXCR4 antibody. TFF2 pretreatment of Jurkat cells decreased Ca2+ rise and chemotactic response to SDF-1alpha. In addition, the CXCR4-negative gastric epithelial cell line AGS became highly responsive to TFF2 treatment upon expression of the CXCR4 receptor. TFF2-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in gastric and pancreatic cancer cells, KATO III and AsPC-1, respectively, was also dependent on the presence of the CXCR4 receptor. Finally we demonstrate a distinct proliferative effect of TFF2 protein on an AGS gastric cancer cell line that expresses CXCR4. Overall these data identify CXCR4 as a bona fide signaling receptor for TFF2 and suggest a mechanism through which TFF2 may modulate immune and tumorigenic responses in vivo.","['Department of Medicine, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York 10032, USA.']","['S0021-9258(19)81779-9 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804935200 [doi]']",20081208,"['R01 DK060758/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '2R01DK060758/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2635042,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sporadic reports on increased incidence of transformation to high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and development of therapy-related myelodysplasia/acute leukemia (t-MDS/AML) among patients with WM treated with NAs prompted us to examine the incidence of such events in a large population of patients with WM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the incidence of these events in 439 patients with WM, 193 and 136 of whom were previously treated with and without an NA, respectively, and 110 of whom had similar long-term follow-up without treatment. The median follow-up for all patients was 5 years. RESULTS: Overall, 12 patients (6.2%) either developed transformation (n = 9; 4.7%) or developed t-MDS/AML (n = 3; 1.6%) among NA-treated patients, compared with one patient (0.4%) who developed transformation in the non-NA treated group (P < .001); no such events occurred among untreated patients. Transformation and t-MDS/AML occurred at a median of 5 years from onset of NA therapy. The median survival of NA-treated patients who developed transformation did not differ from other NA-treated patients as a result of effective salvage treatment used for transformed disease. However, all NA-treated patients who developed t-MDS/AML died at a median of 5 months. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate an increased incidence of disease transformation to high-grade NHL and the development of t-MDS/AML among patients with WM treated with NAs.","[""Bing Center for Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","['JCO.2007.15.1530 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.1530 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated 104 adult patients (median age, 41 years) who underwent unrelated donor UCBT for lymphoid malignancies. UCB grafts were two-antigen human leukocyte antigen-mismatched in 68%, and were composed of one (n = 78) or two (n = 26) units. Diagnoses were non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 61), Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL, n = 29), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, n = 14), with 87% having advanced disease and 60% having experienced failure with a prior autologous transplant. Sixty-four percent of patients received a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen and 46% low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI). Median follow-up was 18 months. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 84% by day 60, with greater engraftment in recipients of higher CD34(+) kg/cell dose (P = .0004). CI of non-relapse-related mortality (NRM) was 28% at 1 year, with a lower risk in patients treated with low-dose total-body irradiation (TBI; P = .03). Cumulative incidence of relapse or progression was 31% at 1 year, with a lower risk in recipients of double-unit UCBT (P = .03). The probability of progression-free survival (PFS) was 40% at 1 year, with improved survival in those with chemosensitive disease (49% v 34%; P = .03), who received conditioning regimens containing low-dose TBI (60% v 23%; P = .001), and higher nucleated cell dose (49% v 21%; P = .009). CONCLUSION: UCBT is a viable treatment for adults with advanced lymphoid malignancies. Chemosensitive disease, use of low-dose TBI, and higher cell dose were factors associated with significantly better outcome.","['Eurocord / ARTM-Hopital Saint Louis, 1, Av Claude Vellefaux, 75475 Paris Cedex 10 France. celsoarrais@uol.com.br']","['JCO.2007.15.8865 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.8865 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2009 Apr 10;27(11):1923'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To verify this, the Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (ALL-REZ BFM) Study Group conducted a prospective trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 1999 and July 2005, 91 children with relapsed ALL treated according to the ALL-REZ BFM 96 or 2002 protocols and receiving stem-cell transplantation in >or= second remission were enrolled. MRD quantification was performed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using T-cell receptor and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Probability of event-free survival (pEFS) and cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) in 45 patients with MRD >or= 10(-4) leukemic cells was 0.27 and 0.57 compared with 0.60 and 0.13 in 46 patients with MRD less than 10(-4) leukemic cells (EFS, P = .004; CIR, P < .001). Intermediate-risk patients (strategic group S1) with MRD >or= 10(-4) leukemic cells (n = 14) had a pEFS of 0.20 and CIR of 0.73, whereas patients with MRD less than 10(-4) leukemic cells (n = 21) had a pEFS of 0.68 and CIR of 0.09 (EFS, P = .020; CIR, P < .001). High-risk patients (S3/4, third complete remission) who received transplantation with an MRD load of less than 10(-4) leukemic cells (n = 25) showed a pEFS and CRI of 0.53 and 0.18, respectively. In contrast, pEFS and CRI were 0.30 and 0.50 in patients who received transplantation with an MRD load of >or= 10(-4) leukemic cells. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed MRD as the only independent parameter predictive for EFS (P = .006). CONCLUSION: MRD is an important predictor for post-transplantation outcome. As a result, new strategies with modified stem-cell transplantation procedures will be evaluated in ALL-BFM trials.","[""Children's Hospital of the JW Goethe University, Frankfurt, Main, Germany. peter.bader@kgu.de""]","['JCO.2008.17.6065 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.17.6065 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,,['ALL-REZ BFM Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2008 Dec 8.,,10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2428 [doi],"Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) is a distinct peripheral T-lymphocytic malignancy associated with a retrovirus designated human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). The diversity in clinical features and prognosis of patients with this disease has led to its subclassification into the following four categories: acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The chronic and smoldering subtypes are considered indolent and are usually managed with watchful waiting until disease progression, analogous to the management of some patients with chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL) or other indolent histology lymphomas. Patients with aggressive ATL generally have a poor prognosis because of multidrug resistance of malignant cells, a large tumor burden with multiorgan failure, hypercalcemia, and/or frequent infectious complications as a result of a profound T-cell immunodeficiency. Under the sponsorship of the 13th International Conference on Human Retrovirology: HTLV, a group of ATL researchers joined to form a consensus statement based on established data to define prognostic factors, clinical subclassifications, and treatment strategies. A set of response criteria specific for ATL reflecting a combination of those for lymphoma and CLL was proposed. Clinical subclassification is useful but is limited because of the diverse prognosis among each subtype. Molecular abnormalities within the host genome, such as tumor suppressor genes, may account for these diversities. A treatment strategy based on the clinical subclassification and prognostic factors is suggested, including watchful waiting approach, chemotherapy, antiviral therapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (alloHSCT), and targeted therapies.","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Science, Nagasaki, Japan. tsukasak@net.nagasaki-u.ac.jp']","['JCO.2008.18.2428 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.18.2428 [doi]']",20081208,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2737379,,,61,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the mechanisms by which Tcl1 protein exerts oncogenic activity in B cells, we investigated the effect of Tcl1 expression on NF-kappaB and activator protein 1 (AP-1) activity. We found that Tcl1 physically interacts with c-Jun, JunB, and c-Fos and inhibits AP-1 transcriptional activity. Additionally, Tcl1 activates NF-kappaB by physically interacting with p300/CREB binding protein. We then sequenced the TCL1 gene in 600 B-CLL samples and found 2 heterozygous mutations: T38I and R52H. Importantly, both mutants showed gain of function as AP-1 inhibitors.

These range from the identification of the first specific chromosomal abnormality associated with cancer to the development of imatinib as a specific, targeted therapy for the disease. The successful development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent for CML can be attributed directly to decades of scientific discoveries. These discoveries determined that the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase is the critical pathogenetic event in CML and an ideal target for therapy. This was confirmed in clinical trials of imatinib, with imatinib significantly improving the long-term survival of patients with CML. Continuing in this tradition of scientific discoveries leading to improved therapies, the understanding of resistance to imatinib has rapidly led to strategies to circumvent resistance. Continued studies of hematologic malignancies will allow this paradigm of targeting molecular pathogenetic events to be applied to many additional hematologic cancers.","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health & Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, USA. drukerb@ohsu.edu']","['S0006-4971(20)51718-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-077958 [doi]']",,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, its requirement during myeloid cell differentiation, development, and effector function is less clear. Lineage-specific deletion of MCL-1 in myeloid precursors results in neutropenia due to death during differentiation. The loss of mature neutrophils induced by Mcl-1 deletion was not rescued by genetic deletion of proapoptotic Bim and Puma or by exogenous cytokine treatment. However, blockade of intrinsic apoptosis by lineage-specific deletion of both multidomain proapoptotics Bax and Bak was capable of rescuing the neutropenia associated with Mcl-1 deletion. In the monocytic lineage, despite efficient Mcl-1 deletion, monocytes and macrophages undergo normal development. During the phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria, macrophages concomitantly increase the expression of both MCL-1 and BIM. However, Mcl-1-deficient macrophages exhibit increased sensitivity to death during bacterial phagocytosis that can be abolished by codeletion of Bim.

The activation of NF-kappaB by Tax has been reported to play a crucial role in HTLV-1-induced transformation. The HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), which is encoded by an mRNA of the opposite polarity of the viral genomic RNA, is involved in both T cell proliferation and suppression of Tax-mediated viral gene transcription, suggesting that HBZ cooperates closely with Tax. In the present study, we observed that HBZ specifically suppressed NF-kappaB-driven transcription mediated by p65 (the classical pathway) without inhibiting the alternative NF-kappaB signaling pathway. In an immunoprecipitation assay, HBZ bound to p65 and diminished the DNA binding capacity of p65. In addition, HBZ induced p65 degradation through increasing the expression of the PDLIM2 gene, which encodes a ubiquitin E3 ligase for p65. Finally, HBZ actually repressed the transcription of some classical NF-kappaB target genes, such as IL-8, IL2RA, IRF4, VCAM-1, and VEGF. Selective suppression of the classical NF-kappaB pathway by HBZ renders the alternative NF-kappaB pathway predominant after activation of NF-kappaB by Tax or other stimuli, which might be critical for oncogenesis.","['Laboratory of Virus Control, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']","['S0006-4971(20)37542-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-161729 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have determined the growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic mechanisms of 2 small molecule inhibitors of FLT3, AG1295 or PKC412, in hematopoietic progenitor cells, human leukemic cell lines, and primary AML cells expressing FLT3-ITD. Inactivation of the PI3-kinase pathway, but not of Ras-mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling, was essential to elicit cytotoxic responses. Both compounds induced up-regulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins Bim and Puma, and subsequent cell death. However, only silencing of Bim, or its direct transcriptional activator FOXO3a, abrogated apoptosis efficiently. Similar findings were made in bone marrow cells from gene-targeted mice lacking Bim and/or Puma infected with FLT3-ITD and treated with inhibitor, where loss of Puma only provided transient protection from apoptosis, but loss of Bim preserved clonal survival upon FLT3-ITD inhibition.","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']","['S0006-4971(20)37614-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-167023 [doi]']",20081208,['Y 212/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC3272395,['UKMS31336'],,,,,,['NLM: UKMS31336'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple studies reveal that peak bone mass is under strong genetic influence. One of the major susceptibility loci for peak spine BMD has been mapped to chromosome 1q21-q23 in the Caucasian population. We have previously replicated this finding in Southern Chinese pedigrees and detected a maximum multipoint log of odds (LOD) score of 2.36 in this region. To further fine-map this region, 380 single-nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) markers were genotyped in 610 sibpairs from 231 families. Several markers were identified in the association analysis as important candidates underlying BMD variation. Among them, successful replication was demonstrated for SNPs in pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBX1) gene in two other unrelated case-control cohorts. The functional role of PBX1 in bone metabolism was examined in vitro using human bone-derived cells (HBDC) and murine MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. PBX1 mRNA was constitutively expressed in both HBDC and MC3T3-E1 cells. Immunostaining revealed that PBX1 is localized in the nucleus compartment. Silencing of PBX1 by RNAi in MC3T3-E1 cells decreased the expression of Runx2 and Osterix, the critical transcription factors for osteogenesis, but accelerated cell proliferation and bone nodule formation. Overall, our data suggest a genetic and functional association of PBX1 with BMD.","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Republic of China.']","['ddn397 [pii]', '10.1093/hmg/ddn397 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to investigate their cytotoxic effect on different leukaemia cell lines. For this purpose we used five different flavonoids (quercetin, caffeic acid, chrysin, naringenin, and naringin) and five types of leukemia cell lines (MOLT, JURKAT, HL-60, RAJI and U937). Cells were cultured at 37 degrees C in the RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS in humified atmosphere with 5% of CO2. Flavonoids were added in the following concentrations: 100 microg mL(-1), 50 microg mL(-1), 25 microg mL(-1), or 12.5 microg mL(-1). The results show different dose- and cell-type-dependent cytotoxicity. Among the flavonoids, quercetin showed the strongest cytotoxic effect in all cell lines. Caffeic acid and chrisyn also expressed a high level of cytotoxicty. Treatment of U937 and HL-60 cell lines with low concentrations of chrisyn or naringenin stimulated cell proliferation. These results suggest a biphase effect of the tested compounds on monocyte cell lines. Cytotoxicity and growth stimulation mechanisms caused directly by flavonoids should further be investigated on the molecular level.","['Zavod za animalnu fiziologiju Bioloski odsjek, Prirodoslovno-matematicki fakultet, Sveuciliste u Zagrebu, Zagreb.']","['M906948H6T138441 [pii]', '10.2478/10004-1254-59-2008-1903 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,Citotoksicnost polifenolnih/flavonoidnih spojeva u kulturi leukemijskih stanica.,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Three kinds of leukemia cell lines, HuT-78, Jurkat and L1210 cells, were used in this study. After different doses of Res treatment, methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) colorimetry was used to detect the cell proliferation; apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry; Western blot and immuno-precipitation method were used to detect the Bcl-2 and Bax proteins expression and the activity of phospho-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3). Besides, a total of 40 BALB/c mice were randomly divided into untreated group and 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/(kg.d) Res groups. Then, leukemia-bearing model was established by L1210 cells subcutaneous injection. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was detected to determine the secretion function of T lymphocytes of the mice; the IL-6 mRNA expression in the liver tissue of mice was also detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the expression of the p-STAT3 protein was measured by Western blot and immunohistochemical method. RESULTS: The results indicated that resveratrol could inhibit the proliferation of HuT-78, Jurkat and L1210 cells and significantly induce the cell apoptosis. At the same time, the radio of Bcl-2/Bax and expression of p-STAT3 protein were decreased either. Furthermore, resveratrol could reduce the expression of IL-6 mRNA and intracellular content of IL-6, and decrease the expression of p-STAT3 protein in the liver of leukemic mice at a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSION: Resveratrol can function as an antileukemic agent through inducing apoptosis, modulating IL-6 and STAT3 both in vitro and in vivo.","[""Department of Immunology, Medical College of the Chinese People's Armed Police Force, Tianjin 300162, China. tanli20042001@yahoo.com.cn""]","['167219772008121267 [pii]', '10.3736/jcim20081212 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effect of GA on the growth of HL-60 cells was determined by MTU assay. Apoptosis was detected with Hoechst 33258 staining and annexin-V FITC/PI double-labeled flow cytometry. The influence on cell cycle was studied by a propidium iodide method. Both flow cytometry (FCM) and RT-PCR techniques were applied to assess the expression of Nup88, whereas the localization of Nup88 was determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. RESULTS: GA presented striking inhibitory effect on proliferation of HL-60 cells in vitro and induction of apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, no obvious influence was found on the cell cycle in HL-60 cells. The IC50 value for 12 h was 1.797 micromol/L. 15.1% of HL-60 cells went apoptosis when treated with 0.4 micromol/L GA for 12 h. When the dose of GA was increased to 1.6 micromol/L, more than half of cells were apoptotic. On the other hand, the expression level of Nup88 was down-regulated in HL-60 cells induced by GA in a dose-dependent manner. The distribution of Nup88 was also changed from widely dispersed in both nucleus and cytoplasm to that only localized at the cytoplasmic side of nuclear membrane, occasionally in the cytoplasm sporadically. CONCLUSION: GA exhibites remarkable inhibitory effect on cell proliferation in leukemic cells and inducing apoptosis in HL-60 cells in a cell cycle-independent manner, which might correspond to the regulation of the expression as well as the distribution of nucleoporin Nup88. It may become a new remedy for treatment for acute leukemia.","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, dasatinib alone demonstrated toxicity to CLL lymphocytes at concentrations that are generally not clinically attainable. Dasatinib resistance and poorer dasatinib-mediated sensitization to chlorambucil and fludarabine was associated with higher expression of c-abl protein levels. In contrast, chlorambucil and fludarabine resistance correlated with basal p53 protein levels. Moreover, Western blot analysis after in vitro treatment of primary CLL lymphocytes with dasatinib, chlorambucil and/or fludarabine, showed that dasatinib: (i) inhibited c-abl function (e.g. downregulation of c-abl protein levels and decreased the phosphorylation of a c-abl downstream target, Dok2), (ii) decreased chlorambucil/fludarabine induced accumulation of p53 protein levels, (iii) altered the response to chlorambucil/fludarabine induced DNA-damage as evidenced by an increase in chlorambucil/fludarabine-induced H2AX phosphorylation, and (iv) accentuated the c-abl downregulation induced by chlorambucil/fludarabine.

Environmental responsive genes, such as the hsp90s, protect the structure and function of cells and accomplish a significant task in cellular homeostasis. To study the hsp90s in M. galloprovincialis a genomic library was screened and two hsp90s were isolated. Sequence analysis revealed that the two genes exhibit great similarities in both the 5' non-coding and the coding region but differ in the 3' non-coding region, as well as in three introns, due to the presence of repeated sequences. Few synonymous substitutions in the coding region of the genes result to an identical predicted polypeptide, which belongs to the cytoplasmic HSP90 subfamily. The 5' non-coding region contains a non-translated exon and multiple binding sites for various transcription factors. The presence of a p53 binding site in the promoter of the isolated genes raises questions about the possible implication of hsp90s in the molluscan leukemia.","['Department of Genetics, Development and Molecular Biology, School of Biology, Faculty of Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GR-54124 Greece.']","['S0378-1119(08)00569-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.gene.2008.10.028 [doi]']",20081113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, transient potent BCR-ABL inhibition with either dasatinib or imatinib is cytotoxic to CML cell lines, as is transient potent EGFR inhibition with erlotinib in a lung cancer cell line. Cytotoxicity correlates with the magnitude as well as the duration of kinase inhibition. Moreover, cytotoxicity with transient potent target inhibition is equivalent to prolonged target inhibition and in both cases is associated with BIM activation and rescued by BCL-2 overexpression. In CML patients receiving dasatinib once daily, response correlates with the magnitude of BCR-ABL kinase inhibition, thereby demonstrating the potential clinical utility of intermittent potent kinase inhibitor therapy.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, UCSF School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. nshah@medicine.ucsf.edu']","['S1535-6108(08)00368-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ccr.2008.11.001 [doi]']",,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cutaneous involvement may be seen in all 4 types of plasma-cell neoplasia. Specific cutaneous involvement in patients with MM is very uncommon. It usually occurs in late stages of MM as a reflection of increased tumor cell burden. Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) of the skin is a well-recognized, extremely rare, occurrence in MM. Extramedullary plasmacytomas of the skin can be divided into primary cutaneous plasmacytoma (PCP) and metastatic cutaneous plasmacytoma (MCP). Primary cutaneous plasmacytoma is defined as monoclonal proliferation of plasma-cells that arises primarily in the skin without evidence of systemic disease. In contrast to PCP, MCP arises from lymphatic or vascular spread of tumour or, more frequently, by direct extension from underlying bone lesions. Chest, back and abdomen are the most frequently involved areas followed by face, scalp, neck and extremities. Unusual localizations have been described related to MCP, including scrotum, eyelid and tongue. In literature, no cases of MCP presenting as a perianal giant mass have ever been reported.

Several efforts to analyze MDS by flow cytometry have been reported in adults. These studies have focused on the identification of abnormalities in the maturation pathway of antigen expression of myelo-monocytic cells, and characterization of blast populations. Therefore, phenotype has been proposed as a diagnostic and prognostic criterion tool for adult MDS. The current article provides data concerning the blast phenotype in pediatric MDS. PROCEDURE: We evaluated by multiparameter flow cytometry 26 MDS pediatric patients with more than 2% of blast cells at bone marrow morphological examination (17 de novo MDS and 9 secondary MDS) and 145 pediatric de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases (M3 excluded). As control group, 12 healthy age-matched donors for allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMD) and 6 regenerating bone marrow samples, collected from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in remission after induction chemotherapy, were studied. RESULTS: We identified a blast immunophenotype typically expressed in most MDS cases and a strong correlation between CD7 expression and poor outcome. CD34+ compartment in MDS bone marrow was also analyzed: a significant decrease of B-cell precursors was detected in MDS patients independent of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the blasts phenotypic features can constitute a diagnostic and prognostic tool also for pediatric MDS.","['Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Pediatric Onco-Hematology, University Hospital of Padua, Padua, Italy.']",['10.1002/pbc.21874 [doi]'],,,,,,,,['AIEOP-MDS Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is still unclear, whether the expression levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) splice variants facilitate the escape from glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and hence contribute to glucocorticoid resistance. PROCEDURE: In the present study, the initial in vivo expression of the common GR (cGR) and its splice variants GR-alpha, GR-gamma and GR-P was determined using a quantitative RT-PCR approach. Two cohorts of glucocorticoid sensitive (prednisone good responder, PGR) and resistant (prednisone poor responder, PPR) patients were compared. The kinetics of GR splice variant expression was measured during 36 hr following the first use of glucocorticoids in seven patients. RESULTS: The GR splice variant GR-gamma showed the most pronounced differential regulation comparing PPR and PGR patients in both cohorts. GR-alpha and GR-gamma were upregulated faster and to a higher level in PGR as compared to PPR in the in vivo stimulation cohort. Here as well, the most pronounced effect was observed for GR-gamma. CONCLUSIONS: Differential regulation of the cGR and its splice variants under glucocorticoid treatment rather than the expression level at diagnosis is associated with glucocorticoid response.","['Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Division of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University of Freiburg, Mathildenstrasse, Freiburg, Germany. melchior.lauten@uniklinik-freiburg.de']",['10.1002/pbc.21867 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

METHODS: Emerging adult survivors of childhood cancer (n=60) and controls without a history of chronic illness (n=60) completed an online assessment of their romantic relationships, including perceived relationship satisfaction. Severity of initial treatment was rated by healthcare providers for participants with cancer. RESULTS: Although survivors of childhood cancer do not differ from demographically similar controls in satisfaction with, conflict in, and duration of romantic relationships, they reported fewer romantic relationships and greater distress at relationship end. Within the survivor group, higher trait anxiety, older age at diagnosis, and more severe treatment intensity increased risk for relationship difficulties, including lower relationship satisfaction and more distress at break-up. CONCLUSIONS: Findings appear to support the overall social resilience of survivors of childhood cancer. Certain subsets of survivors, however, may be at greater risk for difficulties in their close relationships as adults and therefore may be appropriate targets for intervention. Healthcare providers should routinely assess developmentally salient issues like love/romance that are important markers of identity development and ultimately impact long-term quality of life for survivors.","[""Center for Biobehavioral Health, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH 43205-2696, USA. amanda.thompson@nationwidechildrens.org""]",['10.1002/pon.1471 [doi]'],,,,,['Psychooncology. 2010 Nov;19(11):1234.

METHODS: Eleven participating children and their parents completed questionnaires about the disease-related skills that were taught in the intervention, before the intervention and 0-4 weeks after the intervention. In addition, parents were interviewed in focus groups. RESULTS: Positive outcomes were found on most items concerning disease-related skills. Remarkable improvements were found with respect to the intervention goals 'social competence' and 'positive thinking'. The parents reported that sharing emotions and experiences with other survivors of childhood cancer was an important element of the OK Onco program, which underscores the benefit of a disease-specific program for cancer survivors. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, the results of the pilot study indicate that OK Onco is appropriate for paediatric survivors of childhood cancer.

METHODS: This Canadian multi-institutional cross-sectional study included children with cancer receiving any type of active treatment. The primary caregiver rated child prognosis on a 5-point categorical rating scale. For each child, five pediatric oncologists rated prognosis according to child- and disease-related characteristics. RESULTS: Of the 395 included families, 42 (10.6%) of parents rated prognosis as excellent or very good for children in whom physicians rated prognosis as poor. In multiple regression analysis, in comparison to parents of children with leukemia and lymphoma, parents of children with solid tumors (odds ratio (OR) 11.3, 95% CI 4.6, 27.8; P=0.0009) and brain tumors (OR 7.5, 95% CI 2.7, 21.1; P=0.09), parents of children with relapsed disease (OR 10.7, 95% CI 3.6, 31.3; P<0.0001) and parents with greater dispositional optimism (OR 1.1, 95% CI 1.0, 1.2; P=0.008) were more likely to have optimistic prognostic estimates in the setting of physician-rated poor prognosis. CONCLUSION: Approximately 10% of parents have optimistic prognostic estimates in the setting of physician-rated poor prognosis.

It is also widely used in a low dose formulation to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis. In rats, methotrexate is known to induce micronuclei formation, leading to genetic damage, while vitamin A is known to protect against such methotrexate-induced genetic damage. Leucovorin (folinic acid) is generally administered with methotrexate to decrease methotrexate-induced toxicity. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine whether vitamin A and leucovorin differed in their capacity to prevent formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei in rat bone marrow erythrocytes. The present study also aimed to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with vitamin A and leucovorin on the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei. METHODS: Male and female Wistar rats (n=8) were injected with 20 mg/kg methotrexate (single i.p. dose). The control group received an equal volume of distilled water. The third and fourth groups of rats received vitamin A (5000 IU daily dose for 4 successive days) and leucovorin (0.5 mg/kg i.p. dose for 4 successive days), respectively. The fifth and sixth groups of rats received a combination of vitamin A and a single dose of methotrexate and a combination of leucovorin and methotrexate, respectively. The last group of rats received a combination of leucovorin, vitamin A and single dose of methotrexate. Samples were collected at 24 hours after the last dose of the treatment into 5% bovine albumin. Smears were obtained and stained with May-Grunwald and Giemsa. One thousand polychromatic erythrocytes were counted per animal for the presence of micronuclei and the percentage of polychromatic erythrocyte was determined. RESULTS: Comparison of methotrexate-treated rats with the control group showed a significant increase in the percentage of cells with micronuclei and a significant decrease polychromatic erythrocyte percentage. Combined methotrexate and vitamin A therapy and combined methotrexate and leucovorin therapy led to significant decreases in the micronuclei percentage and an increase in polychromatic erythrocyte percentage when compared to rats treated with methotrexate alone. Leucovorin was found to be more effective than vitamin A against the formation of methotrexate-induced micronuclei. CONCLUSIONS: Both vitamin A and leucovorin provided significant protection against genetic damage induced by methotrexate.","['Department of Anatomy, Kasturba Medical College, Mangalore, India. madhyast1971@gmail.com']","['S1807-59322008000600019 [pii]', '10.1590/s1807-59322008000600019 [doi]']",,,PMC2664285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite structural conservation, no other MLL homolog has so far been found in a similar arrangement. Here, we show that fusion proteins based on Mll2, the closest relative of MLL, are incapable of transforming hematopoietic cells. Elaborate swap experiments identified the small CxxC zinc-binding region of Mll2 and an adjacent 'post-CxxC' stretch of basic amino acids as the essential determinants for the observed difference. Gel shift experiments indicated that the combined CxxC and post-CxxC domains of MLL and Mll2 possess almost indistinguishable DNA-binding properties in vitro. Within the cellular environment, however, these motifs guided MLL and Mll2 to a largely nonoverlapping target gene repertoire, as evidenced by nuclear localization, reporter assays, and measurements of homeobox gene levels in primary cells expressing MLL and Mll2 fusion proteins. Therefore, the CxxC domain appears to be a promising target for therapies aimed at MLL fusion proteins without affecting the general function of other MLL family members.","['Department of Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Bavaria, Germany.']","['onc2008443 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.443 [doi]']",20081208,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we characterized four chimeric RTs which comprise one of the fingers, palm, thumb and RNase H domains originated from AMV RT and the other three and connection domains originated from MMLV RT. Unexpectedly, all chimeric RTs exhibited the same characteristics: their specific reverse transcription activities decreased to less than 0.1% of that of MMLV RT, while their specific RNase H activities were approximately 20% of that of MMLV RT. The decreases in the two activities of the chimeric RTs were ascribed to the decreases in k(cat). Based on that the reverse transcription activity of MMLV RT was impaired by substituting its RNase H domain with that from AMV RT, we propose that in MMLV RT, there might be an interaction between the fingers/palm/thumb domain and the RNase H domain.","['Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8502, Japan. yasukawa@kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp']","['mvn166 [pii]', '10.1093/jb/mvn166 [doi]']",20081206,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study determined the effects of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, progesterone (P4), and interferon tau (IFNT) on the expression of LIFR and IL6ST in the ovine uterus. LIFR mRNA and protein were localized to the endometrial luminal (LE) and superficial glandular epithelia (sGE), whereas IL6ST mRNA and protein were localized primarily in the middle to deep GE. Both LIFR and IL6ST mRNAs and protein were more abundant in pregnant than cyclic ewes and increased from days 10 to 20 of pregnancy. Treatment of ovariectomized ewes with P4 and/or infusion of ovine IFNT increased LIFR and IL6ST in endometrial LE/sGE and GE respectively. Co-expression of LIFR and IL6ST as well as phosphorylated STAT3 was observed only in the upper GE of the endometrium as well as in the conceptus trophectoderm on days 18 and 20. In mononuclear trophectoderm and GE cells, LIF elicited an increase in phosphorylated STAT3 and MAPK3/1 MAPK proteins. Collectively, these results suggest that LIFR and IL6ST are both stimulated by IFNT and regulated by P4 in a complex stage- and cell-specific manner, and support the hypothesis that LIF exerts effects on the endometrial GE as well as conceptus trophectoderm during early pregnancy in sheep. Thus, LIF and STAT3 may have biological roles in endometrial function and trophectoderm growth and differentiation.","['Department of Animal Science, Center for Animal Biotechnology and Genomics, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas 77843-2471, USA.']","['REP-08-0437 [pii]', '10.1530/REP-08-0437 [doi]']",20081205,['5 R01 HD32534/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a survey to ascertain all newly diagnosed cases aged 0-16 years in the UK and Republic of Ireland. DESIGN: Three methods of ascertainment were used: the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit (BPSU) system, a survey by Newcastle University, and the Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group (CCLG) registry. Deaths data were obtained from the UK Office for National Statistics and the Central Statistics Office in Ireland. Clinicians who reported cases were sent a questionnaire to obtain demographic and clinical details. RESULTS: Over the 2-year period, 94 cases were identified. The age-standardised incidence rate of LCH in children aged 0-14 years was 4.1 per million per year. The sex ratio (M:F) was 1.5:1 and the median age at diagnosis was 5.9 years. Single system disease (predominantly bony involvement) accounted for 73% of cases and 27% had multisystem disease of whom 7% had involvement of ""risk organs"" (liver, lung, spleen and bone marrow). Three children died, two of whom were diagnosed after death. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of LCH to use an active surveillance method with additional sources of ascertainment. Our incidence is comparable with those in other national reports, although it is likely to be an underestimate as each method may have missed some cases, either diagnosed or undiagnosed.","['Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. jane.salotti@ncl.ac.uk']","['adc.2008.144527 [pii]', '10.1136/adc.2008.144527 [doi]']",20081205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prognostic impact of gene mutations and to identify predictive genetic factors for the all-trans retinoic acid treatment effect. DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from mutation analyses of the NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3, and MLL genes were correlated with outcome in patients 61 years and older treated within the AML HD98B trial. RESULTS: The frequencies of mutations were: NPM1, 23%; CEBPA, 8.5% (analysis restricted to patients with a normal karyotype); FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITD), 17%; FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 5%; and MLL partial tandem duplications, 4.5%. The genotype mutant NPM1 was positively and adverse cytogenetics as well as higher white blood cell count negatively correlated with achievement of complete remission. In Cox regression analysis, a significant interaction between the genotype mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD and treatment with all-trans retinoic acid was identified, in that the beneficial effect of all-trans retinoic acid on relapse-free and overall survival was restricted to this subgroup of patients. Other significant factors for survival were age, adverse cytogenetics, and logarithm of white cell count. CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia, NPM1 mutations are associated with achievement of complete remission, and the genotype 'mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD' appears to be a predictive marker for response to all-trans retinoic acid given as an adjunct to intensive chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00151242).","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. richard.schlenk@uniklinik-ulm.de']","['haematol.13378 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13378 [doi]']",20081204,,PMC2625424,,['Haematologica. 2009 Jan;94(1):10-6.

The TRK (tropomyosin-related kinase) receptor protein tyrosine kinases (TRKA, TRKB, TRKC) are high-affinity NT receptors that are expressed in a variety of human tissues. Their role in normal and malignant hematopoiesis is poorly understood. In a prospective study involving 94 adult patients we demonstrate for the first time cell-surface expression of the 3 TRKs and constitutive activation in blasts from patients with de novo or secondary acute leukemia. At least one TRK was expressed in 55% of the analyzed cases. We establish a clear correlation between the TRK expression pattern and FAB classification. Although only few point mutations were found in TRK sequences by reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we observed coexpression of BDNF (ligand for TRKB) in more than 50% of TRKB(+) cases (16/30). Activation of TRKA or TRKB by NGF and BDNF, respectively, efficiently rescued murine myeloid cells from irradiation-induced apoptosis. Coexpression of TRKB/BDNF or TRKA/NGF in murine hematopoietic cells induced leukemia. Moreover, activation of TRKs was important for survival of both human and murine leukemic cells. Our findings suggest that TRKs play an important role in leukemogenesis and may serve as a new drug target.","['Department ofExperimental Hematology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. li.zhixiong@mh-hannover.de']","['S0006-4971(20)37645-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-155200 [doi]']",20081204,"['R01 CA107492/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA107492-01A2/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2651014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic GVHD was associated with a lower relapse risk in all diagnoses. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) was decreased in patients with AML without acute GVHD receiving a URD transplant (RR, 2.02; P< .001) but was comparable to those receiving HLA-identical sibling transplants in patients with ALL and CML. In patients without GVHD, multivariate analysis showed similar risk of relapse but decreased LFS for URD transplants for all 3 diagnoses.

We performed a comprehensive regional investigation in the Champagne-Ardenne region, France. During the period 1994-2003, 316 patients died of melanoma whereas 10 patients diagnosed with distant metastases had a subsequent survival time > 4 years. These 10 LSs were characterized by a long delay (median: 58 months) prior to distant metastases and by frequent subsequent complete remissions (CRs). Eighteen episodes of CRs, lasting 3-139 months (mean: 26.4), were documented in 9 patients, for single or multiple tumors, for metastases of any site and with any treatment, even including spontaneous CRs. Four of 8 evaluable patients had clinical and/or biological features of auto-immunity. At 31 March 2007, 3 patients had died of melanoma and 1 of a chemo-induced leukaemia. The median survival time was 65 months (range: 52-139).

Blockage of the Notch pathway by short interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) against Notch or a gamma secretase inhibitor significantly reduced Notch, NICD and Hes1 expression and cell proliferation induced by stroke.

Here, we show that vitamin D3 induced functional differentiation by Akt through Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK signaling. Vitamin D3 downregulated Akt, weakened Akt-Raf1 interaction, and subsequently activated the Raf/MEK/ERK MAPK pathway. Pharmacological inhibition of MEK/ERK crippled differentiation in response to vitamin D3. Ectopic overexpression of Akt inhibited MAPK signaling, downregulated cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Wip1/Cip1) and p27(Kip1) and blunted differentiation in response to vitamin D3 while knockdown of Akt by RNA interference gave reverse effects. Furthermore, knockdown of the CDK inhibitors by siRNA crippled the recruitment of retinoblastoma protein (Rb) from the Raf1-Rb complex and Rb hypophosphorylation, and abolished differentiation in response to vitamin D3. Vitamin D3-induced MAPK signaling mediated upregulation of the CDK inhibitors and Rb, disassociation of Raf1 and Rb, and dephosphorylation of Rb, resulting in Rb binding to transcription factor E2F1 and subsequent differentiation. Finally, knockdown of Rb by siRNA prevented vitamin D3-induced differentiation. Mutating Rb at Ser795 evokes its association with E2F1, indicating the critical role of Rb Ser795 in regulating cell differentiation. Taken together, our data suggest that vitamin D3-triggered differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells depends on downregulation of Akt, which dissociates from Raf1 and activates MAPK signaling leading to CDK inhibitor upregulation, Raf1 disassociation from Rb, and Rb upregulation and hypophosphorylation coupled to E2F1 binding.","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Cornell University, New York 14853, USA. jw99@cornell.edu']","['S0171-9335(08)00092-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejcb.2008.05.003 [doi]']",20081205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that infection with Friend leukemia virus (FLV) radiosensitizes murine hematopoietic cells via a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway in C3H hosts. Here, we show that the transduction of the env-gene (gp70) of Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) sensitized C3H-derived myeloid leukemia cells to DNA-damage (ionizing radiation as well as doxorubicin)-induced apoptosis through the activation of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) and P53. Knockdown of DNA-PK by siRNA inhibited the radiosensitization induced by gp70. In association with gp70 and DNA-PK, the acinus and MCM2 proteins were host-specifically overexpressed in C3H-derived cells. Taken together, these data suggested that gp70 enhances cellular DNA-damage-induced signaling in association with host-specific cellular proteins including acinus and MCM2 resulting in the activation of DNA-PK to phosphorylate P53. This in vitro study clearly indicates that the enhancement of DNA-damage-induced apoptosis by gp70 is not caused by the bone marrow environment of the host but is introduced by modified signaling in hematopoietic cells. The mechanisms involved in the ability of a viral protein to regulate cellular gene expression could provide invaluable insight into the manipulation of cellular pro-apoptotic signaling and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.","['Department of Comprehensive Pathology, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']","['S0145-2126(08)00486-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.10.025 [doi]']",20081205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine the contribution of PML to skin tumor susceptibility, transgenic mice were generated on an FVB/N background, that overexpressed the human PML protein in epidermis and hair follicles under the control of the bovine keratin 5 promoter. PML was highly expressed in the epidermis and hair follicles of these mice and was also increased in cultured keratinocytes where it was confined to nuclear bodies. While an overt skin phenotype was not detected in young transgenic mice, expression of keratin 10 (K10) was increased in epidermis and hair follicles and cultured keratinocytes. As mice aged, they exhibited extensive alopecia that was accentuated on the C57BL/6J background. Following skin tumor induction with 7, 12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) as initiator and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as promoter, papilloma multiplicity and size were decreased in the transgenic mice by 35%, and the conversion of papillomas to carcinomas was delayed. Cultured transgenic keratinocytes underwent premature senescence and upregulated transcripts for p16 and Rb but not p19 and p53. Together, these changes suggest that PML participates in regulating the growth and differentiation of keratinocytes that likely influence its activity as a suppressor for tumor development.","['Laboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research.

We have identified 5,621 probe sets as differentially expressed between the 2 subtypes in our series. These differences were validated in 6 independent public series (more than 600 tumours) profiled using different DNA microarrays platforms. Analysis of functions and pathways related to these probe sets, and the extent of the observed differences, confirmed that the 2 subtypes represent very distinct entities. Genes associated with proliferation, cell cycle, cell motility, angiogenesis, and NFkB signalling were overexpressed in basal tumours. Genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, TGFB signalling, and oestrogen receptor (ER) signalling were overexpressed in luminal A samples. Half of the genes overexpressed in luminal tumours contained ER-binding sites. The number of differentially expressed genes was as high as the set of genes discriminating 2 cancers of different anatomical origin (breast and colon) or discriminating acute myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia. We provide a comprehensive list of genes/pathways that define potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets for these 2 subtypes, which should be treated differently given the profound differences observed at the molecular level.","[""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, UMR891 Inserm, Marseille, France. bertuccif@marseille.fnclcc.fr""]",['10.1002/ijc.24055 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causative agent was Candida in 12 (57.2%) and Aspergillus in 9 (42.8%) children. There were 10 children with candidemia (47.6%), 7 with pulmonary aspergillosis (33.4%), 2 with hepatosplenic candidiasis (10.0%), one with sinopulmonary aspergillosis (4.5%) and one with sinus aspergillosis (4.5%). IFI was twice as common in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (20.7%) than in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (10.2%). Duration of profound neutropenia (P = 0.01) and steroid medications (P = 0.001) were significantly associated with IFI in univariate but not in multivariate analysis. Liposomal amphotericin B (L-AMB) was successful in 15 of 21 children as a single agent. Voriconazole produced complete response in four children with invasive aspergillosis and two with hepatosplenic candidiasis, who were unresponsive to L-AMB. The rate of IFI attributable death was 5%. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that AFP with fluconazole and early empirical antifungal therapy may be effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of IFI in children with acute leukemia.","['Pediatric Hematology Unit of Department of Pediatrics, Medical School of Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey. zuhrekaya@gazi.edu.tr']",['10.1002/pbc.21868 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Posterior fossa malformations such as cerebellar hypoplasia or Joubert syndrome are known to be related to developmental problems in a marked to moderate extent. More detailed analyses reveal special deficits in attention, processing speed, visuospatial functions, and language. A study about Dandy Walker syndrome states a relationship of abnormalities in vermis lobulation with developmental problems. Further lobulation or volume abnormalities of the cerebellum and/or vermis can be detected in disorders as fragile X syndrome, Downs's syndrome, William's syndrome, and autism. Neuropsychological studies reveal a relation of dyslexia and attention deficit disorder with cerebellar functions. These functional studies are supported by structural abnormalities in neuroimaging in these disorders. Acquired cerebellar or vermis atrophy was found in groups of children with developmental problems such as prenatal alcohol exposure or extreme prematurity. Also, focal lesions during childhood or adolescence such as cerebellar tumor or stroke are related with neuropsychological abnormalities, which are most pronounced in visuospatial, language, and memory functions. In addition, cerebellar atrophy was shown to be a bad prognostic factor considering cognitive outcome in children after brain trauma and leukemia. In ataxia teleangiectasia, a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily the cerebellar cortex, a reduced verbal intelligence quotient and problems of judgment of duration are a hint of the importance of the cerebellum in cognition. In conclusion, the cerebellum seems to play an important role in many higher cognitive functions, especially in learning. There is a suggestion that the earlier the incorrect influence, the more pronounced the problems.","[""Neuropaediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Inselspital, Bern, Switzerland. maja.steinlin@insel.ch""]",['10.1007/s12311-008-0083-3 [doi]'],20081205,,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Notch1 receptor is cleaved and activated via the gamma-secretase complex. Downregulation of Notch1 signaling by gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) thus represents a potential novel therapeutic approach. In this study, we analyzed the response of four T-ALL cell lines to compound E, a potent gamma-secretase inhibitor, and to the combination of compound E with vincristine, daunorubicin, L-asparaginase (L-ASP), and dexamethasone (DEX). We identified two distinct types of responses: In type 1 cell lines, represented by TALL1 and HSB2, GSI-induced apoptosis followed cell cycle arrest and enhanced the induction of apoptosis caused by DEX and L-ASP. In type 2 cell lines, represented by CEM and Jurkat J6, GSI caused neither cell cycle block nor cell death. Notably, the combination of GSI with chemotherapy-induced resistance by decreasing apoptosis. In type 2 cells, GSI induced the upregulation of Bcl-xl mRNA and protein, which was thus identified as a candidate mechanism for the inhibition of apoptosis. In conclusion, the data presented here caution against clinical use of a combination treatment of GSI and chemotherapy in T-ALL.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0646-x [doi]'],20081205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing interest in the role of air pollutants, including benzene and 1,3-butadiene, in the etiology of childhood cancers. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to assess whether census tracts with the highest benzene or 1,3-butadiene ambient air levels have increased childhood lymphohematopoietic cancer incidence. METHODS: Our ecologic analysis included 977 cases of childhood lymphohematopoietic cancer diagnosed from 1995-2004. We obtained the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 1999 modeled estimates of benzene and 1,3-butadiene for 886 census tracts surrounding Houston, Texas. We ran Poisson regression models by pollutant to explore the associations between pollutant levels and census-tract cancer rates. We adjusted models for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status (cSES). RESULTS: Census tracts with the highest benzene levels had elevated rates of all leukemia [rate ratio (RR) = 1.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05, 1.78]. This association was higher for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (RR = 2.02; 95% CI, 1.03-3.96) than for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) (RR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.92-1.66). Among census tracts with the highest 1,3-butadiene levels, we observed RRs of 1.40 (95% CI, 1.07-1.81), 1.68 (95% CI, 0.84-3.35), and 1.32 (95% CI, 0.98-1.77) for all leukemia, AML, and ALL, respectively. We detected no associations between benzene or 1,3-butadiene levels and lymphoma incidence. Results that examined joint exposure to benzene and 1,3-butadiene were similar to those that examined each pollutant separately. CONCLUSIONS: Our ecologic analysis suggests an association between childhood leukemia and hazardous air pollution; further research using more sophisticated methodology is warranted.","['Division of Epidemiology and Disease Control, University of Texas School of Public Health, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['10.1289/ehp.11593 [doi]'],20080825,"['R03 CA128106/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1 R03 CA128106-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2592281,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['1,3-butadiene', 'air toxics', 'benzene', 'childhood cancer', 'epidemiology', 'hazardous air pollution']",,,,,

EPTC (S-ethyl-N,N-dipropylthiocarbamate) is a thiocarbamate herbicide used in every region of the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that EPTC is most likely not a human carcinogen; however, the previous epidemiologic data on EPTC exposure and cancer risk were limited. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine cancer incidence and EPTC use in 48,378 male pesticide applicators enrolled in the AHS. METHODS: We estimated the rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all cancers and selected cancer sites using Poisson regression. We assessed EPTC exposure using two quantitative metrics: lifetime exposure days and intensity-weighted lifetime exposure days, a measure that accounts for application factors that modify personal exposure likelihood. RESULTS: Among the 9,878 applicators exposed to EPTC, 470 incident cancer cases were diagnosed during the follow-up period ending December 2004 compared with the 1,824 cases among individuals reporting no use. Although EPTC was associated with colon cancer in the highest tertile of both lifetime exposure days and intensity-weighted lifetime days (RR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.26-3.47 and RR = 2.05; 95% CI, 1.34-3.14, respectively) and the trend test was < 0.01 for both, the pattern of RR was not monotonic with increasing use. There was a suggestion of an association with leukemia. No other associations were observed. CONCLUSION: In this analysis, EPTC use appeared to be associated with colon cancer and leukemia. However, given the relatively small number of cases in the highest exposure tertile, results should be interpreted with caution, and further investigations are needed.","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, Maryland, USA.']",['10.1289/ehp.11371 [doi]'],20080626,['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2592275,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['EPTC', 'agriculture', 'cancer', 'herbicide', 'neoplasms', 'occupational exposure', 'pesticides', 'thiocarbamates']",,,,,

This study aimed to define the clinical spectrum, immunology, and candidate genes in HLH in Taiwanese patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The medical records of children who met the updated diagnostic criteria and had confirmed hemophagocytosis by bone marrow aspiration between 1992 and 2007 were retrospectively evaluated. The clinical course and prognosis were analyzed. Quantitative immunoglobulin, lymphocyte subsets, cytotoxicity to K562 cells, intracellular natural killer perforin expression, and candidate genes including SH2D1A, PFR1, Mun13-4, and STX11 genes were also investigated. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (16 male) were evaluated during the 15-year period. The underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, natural killer malignancy, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated HLH was present in 12 patients, 6 of whom died, while 12 of 20 non-EBV-associated patients died despite aggressive polychemotherapy. Extreme immunoglobulin values occurred in 3 fatal cases. There was decreasing percentage of CD4, CD1656, and B-memory cells and increasing CD8, activated lymphocyte, and T-memory cells among the patients. Cytotoxicity in 14 patients and intracellular perforin expression in 13 were diminished but restored to borderline normal range during the convalescent stage. None of the mutations of SH2D1A, PFR1, Mun13-4, and STX11 genes were found. CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of Taiwanese HLH patients, aggressive chemotherapy in EBV-associated patients and stem cell transplantation in non-EBV-associated patients are recommended to improve survival. Individualized immune dysregulation instead of the well-known candidate genetic mutations can explain the genetic variation in our cohort.","[""Primary Immunodeficiency Care and Research (PICAR) Institute, and Departments of Chang Gung Children's and Memorial Hospital, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan. wen2707@hotmail.com""]",['10.1097/INF.0b013e3181813592 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathophysiology of cytopenias includes cytokine effects and direct antigen-specific cytotoxicity to hematopoietic precursors. This review will address the diagnostic challenges of and therapeutic options for T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia. RECENT FINDINGS: Immunosuppressive therapy, with cyclosporine, methotrexate, and oral cyclophosphamide, is often used, but formal trials have not been performed and response rates are poorly established. In refractory cases, alternative regimens such as antithymocyte globulin or monoclonal antibody therapy have exhibited hematologic response. SUMMARY: T-cell large granular lymphocyte leukemia may assume an indolent course but sometimes manifests with significant cytopenias. A majority of patients will ultimately require immunosuppressive therapy due to symptomatic neutropenia or anemia. In these cases, a variety of agents maybe used successfully though chronic therapy is often necessary.","['Experimental Hematology and Hematopoiesis Section, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32831c8407 [doi]', '00062752-200901000-00007 [pii]']",,,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Over this long period of time, the variable genetic causes and associated sequelae of the disease have been ascertained, and successful treatment strategies developed. Over the past 2 years, however, new studies have added greatly to our understanding of the molecular basis of the disease, details of which are presented in this review. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have elucidated a role for the unfolded protein response in mediating the pathogenic effects of ELA2 mutations, the most common mutation in severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) as well as cyclic neutropenia. Genetic lesions in HAX1 have also been identified in the original Kostmann pedigree representing the autosomal recessive form of SCN. An emerging theme is the convergence of these and other genetic lesions underlying SCN in enhancing neutrophil apoptosis. Other studies have revealed the importance of multiple independent mutations in these and other genes in SCN. Finally, the key role for signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 in mediating the effects of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor truncation mutations in the development of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia following SCN has been elucidated. SUMMARY: As the full spectrum of molecular mutations causing neutropenia emerges, it is becoming possible to differentiate patients into subtypes with different prognoses, for whom tailored therapies are indicated.","['School of Medicine, Deakin University, Geelong, Victoria, Australia. award@deakin.edu.au']","['10.1097/MOH.0b013e32831952de [doi]', '00062752-200901000-00004 [pii]']",,"['R24 AI049393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R24 AI049393-05/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R24AI49393/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2720320,['NIHMS94559'],,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this regard, the recent demonstration that PPARdelta is a primary response gene of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD), i.e. a powerful inducer of such process, allowed us to hypothesize the existence of a cross talk between PPARdelta and VD receptor pathways. To address this issue, we analyzed the effects promoted by stimulation with PPARdelta ligands and by overexpression of this nuclear receptor in monoblastic cell lines undergoing exposure to VD. The results obtained evidenced that, although promoting a weak differentiation effect by themselves, PPARdelta ligands efficiently co-operated with VD treatment. In spite of this, PPARdelta overexpression exerted a remarkable inhibitory effect on monocyte-macrophage differentiation induced by VD that was, at least partly, reverted by stimulation with a highly specific PPARdelta ligand. These data indicate that, although acting through a ligand-dependent modality, PPARdelta is a negative regulator of VD-mediated monocyte differentiation, allowing us to hypothesize a role of the investigated nuclear receptor in the differentiation block of M5 type (monoblastic) acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Bioinformatic analysis of a microarray database, containing the expression profiles of 285 AML cases, further supported this hypothesis demonstrating the existence of a subset of M5 type (monoblastic) AMLs that overexpress PPARdelta gene.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, 41100 Modena, Italy.']","['bgn272 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgn272 [doi]']",20081204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among peripheral blood cells, CD96 is expressed on T cells as well as NK cells and a subpopulation of B cells. A possible function of this receptor in NK cell-mediated killing activities was suggested recently. Moreover, CD96 was described as a tumor marker for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia. CD96 binds to CD155 (poliovirus receptor) and nectin-1, an adhesion receptor related to CD155. Here we report that human but not mouse CD96 is expressed in two splice variants possessing either an I-like (variant 1) or V-like (variant 2) second domain. With the notable exception of an AML tumor sample, variant 2 predominates in all the CD96-expressing cell types and tissues examined. Using chimeric human/murine CD96 receptors, we show that the interaction with its ligands is mediated via the outermost V-like domain. In contrast to mouse, however, the binding of human CD96 to CD155 is sensitive to the characteristics of the two downstream domains. This is illustrated by a significantly weaker CD96/CD155 interaction mediated by variant 1 when compared with variant 2. Moreover, recent evidence suggested that mutations in human CD96 correlate with the occurrence of a rare form of trigonocephaly. One such mutation causing a single amino acid exchange in the third domain of human CD96 decreased the capacity of both variants to bind to CD155 considerably, suggesting that a CD96-driven adhesion to CD155 may be crucial in developmental processes.","['Institute of Immunology, Department of Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.']","['S0021-9258(19)81934-8 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M807698200 [doi]']",20081204,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiling after HOXA9 suppression demonstrated co-down-regulation of a program highly expressed in human MLL-AML and murine MLL-leukemia stem cells, including HOXA10, MEIS1, PBX3, and MEF2C.

Similarly, assessment of primary AMLs demonstrated that HOXA9 suppression induces apoptosis to a greater extent in MLL-rearranged samples (P = .01). Moreover, mice transplanted with HOXA9-depleted t(4;11) SEMK2 cells revealed a significantly lower leukemia burden, thus identifying a role for HOXA9 in leukemia survival in vivo.

In cells, holocarboxylase synthetase (HCS) mediates covalent binding of biotin to histones; biotinylation of lysine-12 in histone H4 (K12BioH4) causes gene repression. Here we propose a novel role for HCS in sensing and regulating levels of biotin in eukaryotic cells. We hypothesize that nuclear translocation of HCS increases in response to biotin supplementation; HCS then biotinylates histone H4 at SMVT promoters, silencing biotin transporter genes. We show that nuclear translocation of HCS is a biotin-dependent process that might involve tyrosine kinases, histone deacetylases, and histone methyltransferases in human lymphoid (Jurkat) cells. The nuclear translocation of HCS correlated with biotin concentrations in cell culture media; the relative enrichment of both HCS and K12BioH4 at SMVT promoter 1 (but not promoter 2) increased by 91% in cells cultured in medium containing 10 nmol/L biotin compared with 0.25 nmol/L biotin. This increase of K12BioH4 at the SMVT promoter was inversely linked to SMVT expression. Biotin homeostasis by HCS-dependent chromatin remodeling at the SMVT promoter 1 locus was disrupted in HCS knockdown cells, as evidenced by abnormal chromatin structure (K12BioH4 abundance) and increased SMVT expression. The findings from this study are consistent with the theory that HCS senses biotin, and that biotin regulates its own cellular uptake by participating in HCS-dependent chromatin remodeling events at the SMVT promoter 1 locus in Jurkat cells.","['Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, NE 68583-0806, USA. jzempleni2@unl.edu']","['jn.108.091967 [pii]', '10.3945/jn.108.091967 [doi]']",20081203,"['R01 DK063945/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 ES015206/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 063945/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 015206/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2606921,['NIHMS53448'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The intrinsic mechanism of apoptosis is controlled by Bcl-2 family proteins. Purine nucleoside analogues induce the apoptosis in cells in a state of quiescence. The aim of the study was to assess expression of selected Bcl-2 family proteins in neoplastic infiltration in bone marrow in patients with B-CLL treated with nucleoside analogues. The study comprised examination of bone marrow obtained routinely by trephine biopsy from 18 patients with B-CLL diagnosed before administration of purine nucleoside analogues treatment and after its completion. Expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-x and Bax proteins was examined. Lymphoid cells in bone marrow were present in all patients before administration of treatment. After treatment in two patients bone marrow was infiltrated in diffuse pattern, whereas other patients presented nodular pattern of infiltration. The difference between stage of infiltration before and after treatment was statistically significant (p<0.002). High percentage of infiltration cells with positive anti Bcl-2 reaction from 42.0% in one patient to 85.33+/-3.06% in four patients before treatment was observed. After treatment percentage of infiltration cells with positive anti Bcl-2 antibody reaction was from 33.0+/-18.38% in two patients to 99.0% in one patient. Positive correlation between stage of infiltration and expression of Bcl-2 protein was confirmed before and after treatment. Such correlations were not observed in case of Bax and Bcl-x. Strong staining of immunohistochemical reaction of cells in lymphoid infiltration with Bcl-2 antibody was confirmed. There was a difference between Bcl-/Bax ratio before and after treatment. Immunohistochemical assessment of expression of Bcl-2 family proteins in cells of lymphoid infiltration in bone marrow of patients with CLL is an important method in detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) after treatment.","['Department of Human Anatomy, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland. anatomia@amb.edu.pl']","['11693167273L3787 [pii]', '10.2478/v10042-008-0053-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether differentiation of HL60 and NB4 leukemia cell lines induced by ATRA and PMA alters their drug sensitivity. The differentiation along the neutrophil lineage (upon stimulation with ATRA) and along the monocyte/macrophage lineage (upon stimulation with PMA) was proved by decreased proliferative potential of cells, changes in their morphology, increased ability for NBT reduction and increased expression of CD11b and CD14 cell surface markers. The effect of drugs: cytosine arabinoside, daunorubicin, mitoxantrone and etoposide was examined by Alamar Blue test (proliferation and survival rates), as well as by evaluation of cell smears stained with Hoechst 33342 (apoptotic index). Differentiation resulted in the change of drug sensitivity in both cell lines: the differentiation along the neutrophil pathway (after stimulation with ATRA) increased sensitivity to cytosine arabinoside and mitoxantrone but decreased sensitivity to etoposide; the differentiation along the monocyte/macrophage pathway (induced by PMA) resulted in the decreased sensitivity of both cell lines to all drugs tested. In conclusion, we have shown that ATRA- and PMA-mediated differentiation of HL60 and NB4 cell lines results in the changes of their drug sensitivity.

In WT and SOCS3(DeltaSB/DeltaSB) cells SOCS3 was associated with pJAK1.

Bcl-2 is a prime target for novel therapeutics because it is elevated in many forms of cancer and contributes to cancer progression and therapy resistance based on its ability to inhibit apoptosis. Bcl-2 interacts with proapoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family to inhibit apoptosis and small molecules that disrupt this interaction have already entered the cancer therapy arena. A separate function of Bcl-2 is to inhibit Ca2+ signals that promote apoptosis. This function is mediated through interaction of the Bcl-2 BH4 domain with the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) Ca2+ channel. A novel peptide inhibitor of this interaction enhances proapoptotic Ca2+ signals. In preliminary experiments this peptide enhanced ABT-737 induced apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. These findings draw attention to the BH4 domain as a potential therapeutic target. This review summarizes what is currently known about the BH4 domain of Bcl-2, its interaction with the IP3R and other proteins, and the part it plays in Bcl-2's anti-apoptotic function. In addition, we speculate on how the BH4 domain of Bcl-2 can be targeted therapeutically not only for diseases associated with apoptosis resistance, but also for diseases associated with accelerated cell death.","['Department of Medicine, Comprehensive Cancer Center and University Hospital of Cleveland, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.

Members of the Src family of kinases are involved in the induction of innate and adaptive immunity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory action of dasatinib on antigen-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell function, as well as natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To assess dasatinib-mediated inhibition of antigen-specific T-cell proliferation, transgenic CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells specific for ovalbumin were utilized. Endogenous CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses were determined following immunization of dasatinib-treated or control mice with a nonreplicating recombinant virus. Clearance of the RMA-S cells, a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-deficient thymoma sensitive to NK-cell lysis, was analyzed in mice undergoing dasatinib treatment. RESULTS: Dasatinib inhibited antigen-specific proliferation of murine CD4(+) and CD8(+) transgenic T cells in vitro and in vivo. Endogenous antigen-specific helper T-cell recall responses and induction of T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity following immunization with a nonreplicating recombinant virus were also inhibited. So to was the ability of NK cells to eliminate MHC class I-deficient cells in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that dasatinib has the potential to modulate the host immune response at clinical doses and highlights scope for off target applications, e.g., therapeutic immunosuppression in the context of autoimmune pathogenesis and allogeneic tissue transplantation.","['Experimental Therapeutics Laboratory, Hanson Institute, South Australia, Australia.']","['S0301-472X(08)00463-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.013 [doi]']",20081203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whereas some types of lymphoma and leukemia respond well to this drug, others are resistant. Also, GC-resistance gradually develops upon repeated treatments ultimately leading to refractory relapsed disease. Understanding the mechanisms regulating GC-induced apoptosis is therefore uttermost important for designing novel treatment strategies that overcome GC-resistance. This review discusses updated data describing the complex regulation of the cell's susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by GCs. We address both the genomic and nongenomic effects involved in promoting the apoptotic signals as well as the resistance mechanisms opposing these signals. Eventually we address potential strategies of clinical relevance that sensitize GC-resistant lymphoma and leukemia cells to this drug. The major target is the nongenomic signal transduction machinery where the interplay between protein kinases determines the cell fate. Shifting the balance of the kinome towards a state where Glycogen synthase kinase 3alpha (GSK3alpha) is kept active, favors an apoptotic response. Accumulating data show that it is possible to therapeutically modulate GC-resistance in patients, thereby improving the response to GC therapy.","['The Lautenberg Center for General and Tumor Immunology, The Institute of Medical Research, The Hebrew University, Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']","['S0065-230X(08)00406-5 [pii]', '10.1016/S0065-230X(08)00406-5 [doi]']",,,,,,675,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unknown whether curcumin also has an inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL-expressing B-lymphoid cells. We tested whether curcumin has an inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Pre-B cells isolated from B6 mice expressing wild-type BCR-ABL (B6p210) and T315I mutant (B6T315I) were cultured in serial concentration of curcumin. Cultured cells were analyzed by automated cell counter, flow cytometry, western blotting, and transcription factor arrays. B-ALL was induced by transplantation of MSCV-GFP-p210 transduced donor marrow in lethally irradiated Balb/c mice. Diseased mice were treated with placebo or curcumin until death of the mice. Diseased mice were analyzed by flow cytometric and histopathological analyses. RESULTS: Curcumin inhibited the proliferation of B6p210 and B6T315I cells at concentration as low as 10 muM and induced apoptosis of the cells at concentrations of 30 muM. Using western blots and transcription factors arrays, we showed that curcumin decreased NF-kappaB levels and increased p53 levels. Curcumin decreased c-Abl levels in cells expressing the wild, but not the mutant, BCR-ABL oncogene. Curcumin treatment resulted in a statistically significant improved survival in diseased mice along with decreasing white blood and GFP cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: Curcumin is effective against leukemic cells expressing p210 BCR-ABL and T315I BCR-ABL and holds promise in treating BCR-ABL-induced B-ALL.","['The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA.']",['10.1179/102453308X343437 [doi]'],,['R01-CA114199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Local T cell recruitment will then be essential for the efficiency of the antileukemic response. In this context, the authors compared the chemokine receptor expression for T cells derived from healthy individuals and acute myelogenous leukemia patients with therapy-induced cytopenia after conventional chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Circulating CD3(+) T cells showed the same chemokine receptor expression for all three groups: CCR1(low), CCR2(low), CCR3(low), CCR4(intermediate), CCR5(intermediate), CCR7(low/intermediate), CXCR2(low), CXCR3(intermediate), and CXCR4(high).

The literature regarding the thrombotic complications of this disorder in the developing countries is scarce. The present study was undertaken retrospectively to look at the association of thrombotic complications of PV with various patient characteristics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the patients diagnosed to have PV from January 1986 to December 2005 according to Polycythemia Vera Study Group criteria were included. Their clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, clinical complications such as thrombosis and myelofibrosis, treatment modalities, malignancies and deaths, if any were noted. The various characteristics of patients who had developed thrombosis were compared statistically with those of patients without thrombosis. RESULTS: Out of the 9550 patients seen during this period, 32 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median age at the time of diagnosis was 56.5 years. Eight patients developed thrombotic complications; out of which four had arterial and four had venous thrombosis. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean hemoglobin, white cell count (WBC), platelet count and RBC mass in patients with thrombosis as compared to patients without thrombosis. These parameters were also not statistically significant when patients with arterial thrombosis were compared with patients with venous thrombosis. CONCLUSIONS: PV is an uncommon disorder when compared with other hematological disorders in northern India. There was no relationship between the development of thrombotic complications and hemoglobin, RBC mass or platelet count.

While there was no significant difference in surface phenotypes between these two populations, in vivo assay showed significantly better homing potential of PB CD34(+) cells than BM CD34(+) cells. Significant correlation between homing and engraftment in AML samples was also noted. In addition, gene expression profiling of CD34(+) cells from five paired BM and PB leukaemic samples showed that genes involved in G-protein and prostaglandin signalling, chemotaxis and stress response, cell proliferation and apoptosis were down-regulated in PB CD34(+) myeloblasts. These data suggested that circulating primitive myeloblasts in AML are functionally different from those residing in the marrow compartment, and such differences may be partly regulated by the BM microenvironment.","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']","['BJH7431 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07431.x [doi]']",20081201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(X;7) was further investigated using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and Western blot analyses. FISH revealed a breakpoint at the T-cell receptor beta locus at 7q34 and mapped the corresponding breakpoint to Xq22.3. The latter region contains only two known genes, namely insulin receptor substrate 4 (IRS4) and collagen, type IV, alpha 5 (COL4A5), the expressions of which were analysed by the use of RQ-PCR. COL4A5 was not differentially expressed in the t(X;7)-positive sample compared to five T-ALL controls. However, a marked, 1000-fold overexpression of IRS4 was identified. Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody against IRS4 showed overexpression also at the protein level. Considering that forced expression of several members of the IRS family has been shown to result in increased cell proliferation, for example in haematopoietic cells, we hypothesise that the IRS4 up-regulation in T-ALL is pathogenetically important as a mitogenic stimulus.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden. kristina.karrman@med.lu.se']","['BJH7453 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07453.x [doi]']",20081113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these are the two Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene clusters, class I and class II, which encode highly polymorphic classical HLA-A, B, C and HLA-DR, DQ and DP genes, respectively. The protein products of the classical HLA genes are heterodimeric cell surface molecules that bind short peptides derived from non-self and self proteins, including infections and auto-antigens. The presentation of these HLA-anchored peptides to T lymphocytes triggers a cascade of responses in immune-associated genes that leads to adaptive immunity. Associations between HLA class II alleles and childhood leukemia have been reported in a number of studies. This could be due to the role of HLA allele-restricted peptide binding and T cell activation, or linkage disequilibrium to an MHC-linked ""leukemia gene"" in the pathogenesis of childhood leukemia. Efforts are currently in progress to resolve these questions, using large leukemia case-control sample series such as the UK Childhood Cancer Study (UKCCS) and the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study (NCCLS). Here we review the background to these studies, and present a novel hypothesis based on the paradigm of HLA-associated auto-immune disease that might explain an infection-based etiology of childhood leukemia.","['Cancer Immunogenetics, School of Cancer Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. gmtaylor@manchester.ac.uk']","['S1079-9796(08)00216-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.10.009 [doi]']",20081202,['1R03 CA 125823-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given these unique properties, ESCs are expected to have therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine and as a powerful tool for in vitro differentiation studies of stem cells. Various growth factors and extracellular matrix components regulate the pluripotency and differentiation of ESC progenies. Thus, the cell surface receptors that bind these regulatory factors are crucial for the precise regulation of stem cells. To identify membrane proteins that are involved in the regulation of pluripotent stem cells, the membrane proteins of murine ESCs cultured with or without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were purified and analyzed by quantitative proteomics. 2-D PAGE-based analysis using fluorescently labeled proteins and shotgun-based analysis with isotope-labeled peptides identified 338 proteins, including transmembrane, membrane-binding, and extracellular proteins, which were expressed specifically in pluripotent or differentiated murine ESCs. Functions of the identified proteins revealed cell adhesion molecules, channels, and receptors, which are expected to play important roles in the maintenance of murine ESC pluripotency. Membrane proteins that are expressed in pluripotent ESCs but not in differentiated cells such as Slc16a1 and Bsg could be useful for the selection of the stem cells in vitro.","['Department of Life Sciences (Biology), Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['10.1002/pmic.200800496 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In primary cells, rapamycin was more active in hematological than in solid tumor samples, with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute lymphocytic leukemia being the most sensitive tumor types. Considerable inter-individual differences in sensitivity were apparent among CLL samples, but no difference was observed between IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL samples, whereas a tendency to lower rapamycin sensitivity was indicated for samples displaying poor-prognostic genomic markers. Combination experiments in CLL cells indicated that rapamycin acted synergistically with vincristine, cisplatin, chlorambucil and taxotere. These results and the clinically-experienced good tolerance to rapamycin analogues encourage clinical studies of rapamycin in CLL treatment as single agent but also in combination with, e.g., vincristine and chlorambucil.","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. anna.aleskog@medsci.uu.se']","['906347667 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802475295 [doi]']",,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Dec;49(12):2235-6.

The aim of our study was to analyse the frequency and type of hematological and non-hematological adverse events in our series of late and early chronic phase patients with CML treated with imatinib and correlate the grade of hematological toxicity with the response obtained. Hematological events were seen in 59 out of 150 (39%) late chronic phase (CP) patients: of these, 24% experienced toxicity Grade 3-4. Of the 100 early CP patients, 26 (26%) had hematological adverse event: 7% experienced toxicity Grade 3-4 (p=0.0001). We found that only in early CP patients, the occurrence of hematological side effects of any grade within 6 months of therapy had a negative influence on cytogenetic response. We compared the incidence of non-hematological adverse events occurring in late and in early CP patients and found that in these latter, some side effects were more frequent, such as weight gain, periorbital edema, muscle cramps, skin rashes, diarrhea, weeping. On the contrary, we found that bone pain and hemorrhagic events were more common in late CP patients. Grade 3-4 adverse events were recorded at rates below 4% and decreased over time: in late CP patients hemorrhages and muscle cramps were the most common side effects of Grade 3-4, whereas in early CP patients, the most frequent events were nausea, weight gain and cutaneous rash. We have observed that hematological and non-hematological side effects during imatinib therapy are different among late and early CP patients and that severe hematological toxicity may influence cytogenetic response only in early CP patients.","['Department of Cellular Biotechnology and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy. breccia@bce.uniroma1.it']","['906347716 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802578841 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3-D835 mutations and FLT3-ITD were detected by PCR-RFLP assay and standard PCR amplification, respectively. Mean age at diagnosis was 11.3 months. Overall, 7.5% (ITDs n=6 and D835 n=6) of patients contained FLT3 mutations. FLT3 mutated cases exhibited significantly higher white blood cells (WBC) than wild-type patients (p=0.013). Median overall survival time was 9.2 months (SE 3.3, 95% CI 2.8-15.6). Variables with significant poorer outcomes were age<6 months (p=0.0043), MLL+ (p=0.0292), AML subtype (p=0.0008), high WBC (p=0.0179) and FLT3-D835 mutation (p=0.042). The concomitant presence of FLT3 and MLL abnormalities displayed the worst survival (p=0.0032). Cox regression analysis, with survival as endpoint, showed that leukemia subtype and WBC were independent prognostic factors.

The incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD was 23.6% for all patients. No significant difference in the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD was observed between HLA-A or B 1 locus mismatch transplantation (18.8%) and HLA-DRB1 1 locus mismatch transplantation (16.7%) (P = 0.96). The incidence of chronic GVHD was 71.7%. Disease-free survival at 5 years was 53.2% for patients with standard risk disease and 24.5% for patients with high-risk disease.

Their interrelationships and interactions with HSCs in vivo remain largely unknown. Here we report the use of a newly developed ex vivo real-time imaging technology and immunoassaying to trace the homing of purified green-fluorescent-protein-expressing (GFP(+)) HSCs. We found that transplanted HSCs tended to home to the endosteum (an inner bone surface) in irradiated mice, but were randomly distributed and unstable in non-irradiated mice. Moreover, GFP(+) HSCs were more frequently detected in the trabecular bone area compared with compact bone area, and this was validated by live imaging bioluminescence driven by the stem-cell-leukaemia (Scl) promoter-enhancer. HSCs home to bone marrow through the vascular system. We found that the endosteum is well vascularized and that vasculature is frequently localized near N-cadherin(+) pre-osteoblastic cells, a known niche component. By monitoring individual HSC behaviour using real-time imaging, we found that a portion of the homed HSCs underwent active division in the irradiated mice, coinciding with their expansion as measured by flow assay. Thus, in contrast to central marrow, the endosteum formed a special zone, which normally maintains HSCs but promotes their expansion in response to bone marrow damage.","['Stowers Institute for Medical Research, 1000 E. 50th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64110, USA.']","['nature07639 [pii]', '10.1038/nature07639 [doi]']",20081203,,,,,,['Nature. 2010 Aug 26;466(7310):1134'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is also expressed at the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, where it is essential for cell migration. It is not known whether PDLIM2 function at the nucleus and cytoskeleton is linked and whether PDLIM2 subcellular location is regulated in hematopoietic cells. To investigate this, we used the human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 that can differentiate into adherent macrophages and the adherent murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7. PMA-induced differentiation of THP-1 cells resulted in increased accumulation of PDLIM2. In differentiated cells, PDLIM2 exhibited retarded mobility indicative of serine phosphorylation, which could be reversed by phosphatases and by inhibition of protein kinase C or ERK kinases. In nondifferentiated THP-1 cells, PDLIM2 was located predominantly in the nucleus, whereas in differentiated cells, PDLIM2 was located predominantly in the cytoplasm. Suppression of PDLIM2 expression in THP-1 and RAW 264.7 cells resulted in decreased adhesion, increased NF-kappaB transcription reporter activity, and increased LPS-induced TNF-alpha production. Overexpression of PDLIM2 in THP-1 cells enhanced cell adhesion.

For each individual array, this reference alignment procedure (RAP) uses a set of selected markers as internal references to direct the signal alignment. RAP aligns the signals so that each array has a similar signal distribution among its reference markers. An accompanying reference selection algorithm (RSA) uses genotype calls and initial signal intensities to choose two-copy markers as the internal references for each array. After RSA and RAP are applied, each array has a similar distribution of signals of two-copy markers so that across-array signal comparisons are biologically meaningful. An upper bound for a statistical metric of signal misalignment is derived and provides a theoretical basis to choose RSA-RAP over other alignment procedures for copy number analysis of cancers. In our study of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, RSA-RAP gives copy number analysis results that show substantially better concordance with cytogenetics than do two other alignment procedures.

The etiologic agent for ""spontaneous"" AK lymphoma is an RNA virus present at birth in AKR mice. Lymphoma cells first appear in the thymuses of animals at 5-->12 months of age. The time lapse between the first appearance of viable lymphoma cells in the thymus and clinical diagnosis (eg, with about 10(9) widely disseminated viable plus nonviable lymphoma cells in the host) is about 1 month. Thus, the overall doubling time of lymphoma cells before diagnosis is about 1 day. This estimate is compatible with the doubling time of relatively small numbers of first-passage lymphoma cells, assay data on the rate of repopulation of viable lymphoma cells after therapeutic reduction, and the median intermitotic time of dividing lymphoma cells (ie, 0.6 day). In general, the cytokinetic parameters of advanced spontaneous AK lymphoma cell populations are more like those observed in advanced human leukemias than are those of early L1210 leukemia. This paper presents assay data on the reduction in viable spontaneous AK lymphoma cells after treatment with a variety of agents, and the rate of cell repopulation after cessation of treatment. Extensive therapeutic trial data indicate that cyclophosphamide is presently the most effective single agent against spontaneous AK lymphoma, with arabinosylcytosine or palmO-ara-C a close second. Daunomycin, 5-fluorouracil, the nitrosoureas, vincristine, methotrexate, and dexamethasone provided moderate increases in host survival time. The combination of vincristine plus prednisone was a good remission inducer but the median survival time after cessation of treatment was shorter than that observed for cyclophosphamide or palmO-araC. The best responses observed to date with two-drug combinations appear better on several scores than the best that have been observed with single drugs. The best overall responses observed to date with two-drug combinations were with palmO-ara-C plus methyl-CCNU, cyclophosphamide plus methyl-CCNU, and palmO-ara-C plus cyclophosphamide. Some three- and four-drug combinations have provided better therapeutic responses than have been observed with single agents but not significantly better than those obtained with two-drug combinations. Splenomegaly assays carried out immediately after cessation of treatment and 60 days and longer after cessation of treatment, suggest that eradication of all viable lymphoma cells is being achieved in some animals by combination chemotherapy; however, such animals eventually die of lymphoma, presumably as a result of the reinduction of a second lymphoma cell population. The requirements for permanent ""cure"" of spontaneous lymphoma in AKR mice include eradication of all viable lymphoma cells and prevention of reinduction. Two major differences between early L1210 leukemia and clinically diagnosed spontaneous AK lymphoma are the degree of disease advancement at the time therapy is usually started (and associated cytokinetic differences) and the reinduction problem in AKR mice. Spontaneous AK lymphoma is relatively more advanced at diagnosis than is acute leukemia in man (ie, with respect to nearness of the host to death), and it is presumed that the reinduction problem in AKR mice is more acute and more prevalent than in human neoplastic disease.","['Kettering-Meyer Laboratory, Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL, USA.']",,,"['NIH-71-2021/PHS HHS/United States', 'NIH-71-2098/PHS HHS/United States', 'PH43-65-654/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States', 'PH43-66-29/PH/PHPPO CDC HHS/United States']",,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over a 2-month period, strains of the species were isolated from clinical material obtained from patients hospitalized at the Department of Haemato-Oncology of the University Hospital Olomouc. The strains were identified using standard microbiological techniques and the Vitek 2 automated system. Production of AmpC beta-lactamases was roughly determined by phenotypic tests and subsequently confirmed by PCR detection of genes encoding these enzymes. RESULTS: During the above-mentioned period, a total of 35 K. pneumoniae isolates were collected. In 7 of them, production of AmpC beta-lactamases was preliminarily detected by phenotypic test. The multiplex PCR method confirmed phenotyping and determined DHA types in all the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: All AmpC-positive isolates were false-susceptible to at least one of the tested third-generation cephalosporins.

Different regimens of IT chemotherapies have been formulated, often in conjunction with systemic high-dose chemotherapy leading to penetration of the drugs into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The three commonest IT drugs are methotrexate, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), and corticosteroids. The CSF half-lives of methotrexate and Ara-C are much prolonged, a factor to be considered if these drugs are also administered systemically in high doses. Neurotoxicities attributed to IT chemotherapy have been reported, including spinal cord lesions, seizures, and encephalopathy. Spinal cord lesions, manifesting as tetraplegia, paraplegia, and cauda equina syndrome, are the commonest neurotoxicity. It is mostly related to combined IT methotrexate and Ara-C, or Ara-C as the sole IT agent when given at high doses or as a slow-release preparation. Cord lesions rarely recover and patients are left with motor deficits, bowel and urinary disabilities. Seizures and encephalopathy are reported in relatively fewer patients, with variable manifestations and prognosis.

APL cells from a murine cathepsin G-PML-RARalpha knockin mouse were genetically modified with firefly luciferase (APL(luc)) to allow tracking by bioluminescence imaging. Coculture of APL(luc) cells with M2-10B4 stromal cells protected the leukemia cells from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in vitro. Upon injection into syngeneic recipients, APL(luc) cells rapidly migrated to the BM followed by egress to the spleen then to the peripheral blood with death due to leukostasis by day 15. Administration of AMD3100 to leukemic mice induced a 1.6-fold increase in total leukocytes and a 9-fold increase of circulating APL blast counts, which peak at 3 hours and return to baseline by 12 hours.

Resolution of eosinophilic inflammation and return to homeostasis is in part due to endogenous chemical mediators, for example, lipoxins, resolvins, and protectins. Lipoxins are endogenous eicosanoids that demonstrate antiinflammatory activity and are synthesized locally at sites of inflammation. In view of the importance of lipoxins (LXs) in resolving inflammation, we investigated the molecular basis of LXA(4) action on eosinophilic granulocytes stimulated with GM-CSF employing the eosinophilic leukemia cell line EoL-1 as well as peripheral blood eosinophils. We report herein that LXA(4) (1-100 nM) decreased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in EoL-1 cells stimulated with GM-CSF. Additionally, the expression of a number of GM-CSF-induced cytokines was inhibited by LXA(4) in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, using a proteomics approach involving mass spectrometry and immunoblot analysis we identified 11 proteins that were tyrosine phosphorylated after GM-CSF stimulation and whose phosphorylation was significantly inhibited by LXA(4) pretreatment. Included among these 11 proteins were alpha-fodrin (nonerythroid spectrin) and actin. Microscopic imaging showed that treatment of EoL-1 cells or blood eosinophils with GM-CSF resulted in the reorganization of actin and the translocation of alpha-fodrin from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. Importantly, alpha-fodrin translocation was prevented by LXA(4) but actin reorganization was not. Thus, the mechanism of LXA(4) action likely involves prevention of activation of eosinophilic granulocytes by GM-CSF through inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphorylation and modification of some cytoskeletal components.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555, USA.']","['181/12/8688 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.12.8688 [doi]']",,"['N01HV28184/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI062885/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-ES006676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HV-28184/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN268201000037C/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 HV028184-13/HV/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES006676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4465225,['NIHMS695521'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, stimulatory CpG and GpC DNA oligonucleotides target CD27(+)IgM(+) and CD27(-)IgM(+) B cells (but not IgM(-) B cells) and enhance ZAP70 expression predominantly in the IgM(+)CD27(+) B cell subset. ZAP70 is induced via activation of TLR-7 or -9 in a MyD88-dependent manner, depends on protein kinase B (PKB)/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and is rapamycin sensitive. Furthermore, ZAP70 expression levels correlate with induction of cyclin A2, prolonged B cell proliferation, and sustained induction of PKB. These events are not observed upon CD40 ligation. However, this deficit can be overcome by the expression of constitutively active PKB, given that CD40 ligation of PKB-transgenic B cells induces B cell proliferation and ZAP70 expression. These results highlight a major difference between CD40- and TLR-7/9-mediated B cell activation and suggest that ZAP70 expression levels in B cells give an estimate of the proliferative potential and the associated PKB availability.","['Department of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany. bekeredjian-ding@uni-heidelberg.de']","['181/12/8267 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.12.8267 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Results were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis in blasts of an independent cohort of 71 patients. High INDO expression was correlated to significantly shortened overall and relapse-free survival. Correlation of INDO expression to relevant known prognostic factors and survival identified high INDO expression as a strong negative independent predicting variable for overall and relapse-free survival. Inhibition of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase expressed by myeloid leukemic blasts may result in breaking immune tolerance and offers new therapeutic options for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Centre, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV Amsterdam, The Netherlands. m.chamuleau@vumc.nl']","['93/12/1894 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13113 [doi]']",,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2009 Aug;94(8):1182'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytoplasmic domain of SR-A (CSR-A) is responsible for internalization of the receptor-ligand complex into cells. In the present study we tried to reduce cellular uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (AcLDL) by inducing the interaction between the CSR-A and a novel peptide H11, which was screened from a phage-displayed peptide library. When H11 was fused with a cross membrane peptide TAT, the fusion peptide could enter cell efficiently. The peptide H11 inhibited the binding and uptake of DiI-AcLDL and attenuated lipid accumulation in the differentiated human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) macrophages. Furthermore, the interaction of peptide H11 with the CSR-A inhibited the expression of SR-A protein as well as the phosphorylation of c-jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) in cells, which mediates cellular lipid accumulation-related signaling pathways. These results suggest that the CSR-A can be a potential target to prevent lipid accumulation in cells.

Hypotheses of an infectious etiology have been around for a long time, and in the last 20 years there have been two main theoretical contenders. One of these involves the possibility of a specific infectious agent having a causative role, and animal leukemia viruses would be analogous to this. Another theory relates to the possible involvement of unusual patterns of infections in infancy and how they might relate to aberrant immune responses. The first of these is easier to test. In New Zealand, since the early 1990s we have embarked on a program of research on the epidemiology of childhood leukemia. One of the goals has been to test hypotheses about the role of infection in causation. A variety of study designs have been employed, including descriptive, clustering, case-control and contributions to pooled international analyses. Some of the more interesting findings include: there has been a marked increase in the incidence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia among young children in New Zealand since the mid 1960s, poorer families are at greater risk, and there is no clear support for hypotheses of an infectious cause from the New Zealand data. However because of our small total population (4 million people) we cannot produce clear results on our own. Hence our current international collaborations, for example in CLIC (the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium) represent an important step forward. As countries work together across international boundaries we have a renewed hope that the causes of the childhood leukemias will be unlocked in the foreseeable future.","[""Dean's Department, Dunedin School of Medicine, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand. john.dockerty@otago.ac.nz""]","['S1079-9796(08)00211-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.10.008 [doi]']",20081202,,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution of aspartic acid with valine (D816V) renders the receptor independent of ligand for activation and signaling. Wild-type c-Kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor that requires its ligand, stem cell factor (SCF), for activation. Several isoforms of c-Kit exist as a result of alternative mRNA splicing, of which two are characterized by the presence or absence of four amino acids (GNNK- and GNNK+, respectively) in the extracellular domain. The two isoforms show differences in signal transduction and biological activities and the shorter isoform seems to be highly expressed than the longer isoform in human malignancies. In this study we analysed the signal transduction downstream of the oncogenic c-Kit mutant D816V in an isoform specific context, using the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3 stably transfected with the different versions of isoform and mutant receptor. Our data show that in contrast to the differences shown in the activation of wild-type c-Kit isoforms, both isoforms of c-Kit/D816V are constitutively phosphorylated to the same extent. By the use of Western blot analysis we investigated the activation of different signaling proteins and found that both D816V/GNNK- and D816V/GNNK+ constitutively phosphorylated Gab2, Shc, SHP-2 and Cbl to almost the same extent as c-Kit/GNNK-. In addition, both isoforms of c-Kit/D816V induced SCF-independent cell survival and proliferation equally well. This is in contrast to wild-type c-Kit, where c-Kit/GNNK- induced better cell survival and stronger proliferation than c-Kit/GNNK+, and both required stimulation with SCF. Taken together, these findings reveal that the differences in downstream signal transduction and biological responses between the two GNNK isoforms are eliminated by the D816V mutant.","['Experimental Clinical Chemistry, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Malmo University Hospital, Lund University, SE-205 02 Malmo, Sweden.']","['S0898-6568(08)00340-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.11.008 [doi]']",20081117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There have been many contrasting data establishing a relationship between the two Bcr/Abl transcripts and platelet counts and also response to treatment. However, the data published to date have been on a small group of patients. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there was any difference between clinical and hematological parameters at diagnosis between the two Bcr/Abl fusion transcripts in our population, and whether the two transcripts responded differently or similarly to imatinib treatment. RT-PCR was performed in 202 cases for detection of Bcr/Abl transcripts in newly diagnosed chronic myelogenous leukemia cases in one year. The two transcripts were compared and correlated with clinical, hematological and FISH data and with response to treatment. A total of 138 cases were of b3a2 and 64 were of b2a2 transcript. There was no correlation between the hematological parameters and the type of transcript. There was a significant association of blast crisis with b2a2, especially with myeloid blast crisis. When compared to FISH results, 10% of b3a2 were found to have a significant association with 5'Abl deletion as compared to 3% of b2a2. On analyzing the therapeutic response, we did not find any difference between the two transcripts. In conclusion, our findings confirm that the b3a2 type transcript is not significantly associated with thrombocytosis, that the short transcript, b2a2, occurs with acute phase, i.e., blast crisis, and that there is no difference in treatment response between the two transcripts. However, further studies are required to understand the molecular pathways involved in the Bcr/Abl mechanism.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Molecular Biology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India. drsunitap@yahoo.co.in']","['gmr485 [pii]', '10.4238/vol7-4gmr485 [doi]']",20081021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results obtained demonstrate that araC-resistant H9 and Molt-4 (H9(r)ARAC(100) and Molt-4(r)ARAC(100)) cell lines are more sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis than their respective parental cell lines. This increased sensitivity was associated with a higher surface expression of ligands for the NK cell-activating receptor NKG2D, notably UL16 binding protein-2 (ULBP-2) and ULBP-3 in H9(r)ARAC(100) and Molt-4(r)ARAC(100) cell lines. Blocking ULBP-2 and ULBP-3 or NKG2D with monoclonal antibody completely abrogated NK cell lysis. Constitutive phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not pAKT was higher in araC-resistant cells than in parental cell lines. Inhibition of ERK using ERK inhibitor PD98059 decreased both ULBP-2/ULBP-3 expression and NK cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active ERK in H9 parental cells resulted in increased ULBP-2/ULBP-3 expression and enhanced NK cell lysis. These results demonstrate that increased sensitivity of araC-resistant leukemic cells to NK cell lysis is caused by higher NKG2D ligand expression, resulting from more active ERK signaling pathway.","['Institut fur Medizinische Virologie, Zentrum der Hygiene, Klinikum der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universitat, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",['10.1593/neo.08972 [doi]'],,,PMC2586691,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work was carried out to examine the role of MAT II activity and SAMe biosynthesis in the survival of leukemic T cells. Inhibition of MAT II and the resultant decrease in SAMe levels enhanced expression of FasL mRNA and protein, and induced DISC (Death Inducing Signaling Complex) formation with FADD (Fas-associated Death Domain) and procaspase-8 recruitment, as well as concomitant increase in caspase-8 activation and decrease in c-FLIP(s) levels. Fas-initiated signaling induced by MAT II inhibition was observed to link to the mitochondrial pathway via Bid cleavage and to ultimately lead to increased caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in these cells. Furthermore, blocking MAT 2A mRNA expression, which encodes the catalytic subunits of MAT II, using a small-interfering RNA approach enhanced FasL expression and cell death, validating the essential nature of MAT II activity in the survival of T leukemic cells.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Louisville Medical Center, 511 S.

Of the 71 patients, three had been clinically diagnosed with neurofibromatosis type 1, and PTPN11 and NRAS/KRAS mutations were found in 32 (45%) and 13 (18%) patients, respectively. No simultaneous aberrations were found. Compared with patients with RAS mutation or without any aberrations, patients with PTPN11 mutation were significantly older at diagnosis and had higher fetal Hb levels, both of which have been recognized as poor prognostic factors. As was expected, overall survival was lower for patients with the PTPN11 mutation than for those without (25 versus 64%; p = 0.0029). In an analysis of 48 patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, PTPN11 mutations were also associated with poor prognosis for survival. Mutation in PTPN11 was the only unfavorable factor for relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (p = 0.001). All patients who died after relapse had PTPN11 mutation.

However, the mechanism by which BLNK suppresses pre-B-cell leukemia, as well as the identification of other genetic alterations that collaborate with BLNK deficiency to cause leukemogenesis, are still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that the JAK3/STAT5 signaling pathway is constitutively activated in pre-B leukemia cells derived from BLNK(-/-) mice, mostly due to autocrine production of IL-7. Inhibition of IL-7R signaling or JAK3/STAT5 activity resulted in the induction of p27(kip1) expression and cell-cycle arrest, accompanied by apoptosis in the leukemia cells. Transgene-derived constitutively active STAT5 (STAT5b-CA) strongly synergized with the loss of BLNK to initiate leukemia in vivo. In the leukemia cells, exogenously expressed BLNK inhibited autocrine JAK3/STAT5 signaling, resulting in p27(kip1) induction, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. BLNK-inhibition of JAK3 was dependent on the binding of BLNK to JAK3. These data indicate that BLNK normally regulates IL-7-dependent proliferation and survival of pre-B cells through direct inhibition of JAK3. Thus, somatic loss of BLNK and concomitant mutations leading to constitutive activation of Jak/STAT5 pathway result in the generation of pre-B-cell leukemia.","['Division of Molecular Biology, Research Institute for Biological Sciences, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Japan.']","['S0006-4971(20)37716-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-166355 [doi]']",20081201,,PMC2644075,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients 16 to 85 years of age with primary AML, known karyotype, and uniform postremission chemotherapy enrolled onto two consecutive trials were eligible and were randomly assigned to induction either with a standard-dose (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and 6-thioguanine) and a high-dose (cytarabine and mitoxantrone) combination, or with two courses of the high-dose combination. Subgroups were defined by karyotype, nucleophosmin and FLT3 mutation, WBC count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and residual blasts. RESULTS: In 1,284 patients, the overall survival at 4 years in those younger and older than 60 years was 37% versus 16% (P < .001) and the ongoing remission duration was 46% versus 22% (P < .001). Similar age-related differences in outcome were found for all defined subgroups. No difference in outcome according to randomly assigned treatment regimen was observed in any age group or prognostic subset. Regarding prognostic subgroups, molecular factors were also considered. CONCLUSION: Under harmonized conditions, older and younger patients with AML show modest differences in their risk profiles and equally no dose response to intensified chemotherapy. Their observed fundamental difference in outcome across all subgroups remains unexplained. Further molecular investigation may elucidate the age effect in AML and identify new targets.","['University of Munster, Department of Hematology/Oncology, Munster, Germany. buechnr@uni-muenster.de']","['JCO.2007.15.4245 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.4245 [doi]']",20081201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of this activity is incompletely understood. Here, we show that HPV-16 E7 induces an increased formation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT)-associated promyelocytic leukemia bodies (APBs) in early passage primary human keratinocytes as well as HPV-negative tumor cells. This activity was found to require sequences of HPV-16 E7 involved in degradation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein as well as regions in the COOH terminus. HPV-16 E7-induced APBs contained ssDNA and several proteins that are involved in the response to DNA replication stress, most notably the Fanconi anemia D2 protein (FANCD2) as well as BRCA2 and MUS81. In line with these results, we found that FANCD2-containing APBs form in an ATR-dependent manner in HPV-16 E7-expressing cells. To directly show a role of FANCD2 in ALT, we provide evidence that knockdown of FANCD2 rapidly causes telomere dysfunction in cells that rely on ALT to maintain telomeres. Taken together, our results suggest a novel link between replication stress and recombination-based telomere maintenance that may play a role in HPV-16 E7-mediated extension of host cell life span and immortalization.","['Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Graduate Program, and Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA.']","['68/23/9954 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0224 [doi]']",,['R01 CA112598/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2597390,['NIHMS72786'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation has been detected at a high rate among newborns ( approximately 1%); therefore, the rate-limiting event for leukemia seems to be secondary mutations. One such frequent mutation in this subtype is partial deletion of chromosome 12p, trans from the translocation. Nine del(12p) breakpoints within six leukemia cases were sequenced to explore the etiology of this genetic event, and most involved cryptic sterile translocations. Twelve of 18 del(12p) parent sequences involved in these breakpoints were located in repeat regions (8 of these in long interspersed nuclear elements). This stands in contrast with TEL-AML1, in which only 21 of 110 previously assessed breakpoints (19%) occur in DNA repeats (P=0.0001). An exploratory assessment of archived neonatal blood cards revealed significantly more long interspersed nuclear element CpG methylations in individuals at birth who were later diagnosed with TEL-AML1 leukemia, compared with individuals who did not contract leukemia (P=0.01). Nontemplate nucleotides were also more frequent in del(12p) than in TEL-AML1 junctions (P=0.004), suggesting formation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Assessment of six archived neonatal blood cards indicated that no del(12p) rearrangements backtracked to birth, although two of these patients were previously positive for TEL-AML1 using the same assay with comparable sensitivity. These data are compatible with a two-stage natural history: TEL-AML1 occurs prenatally, and del(12p) occurs postnatally in more mature cells with a structure that suggests the involvement of retrotransposon instability.","['Laboratory for Molecular Epidemiology, Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California 941143-0441, USA. joe.wiemels@ucsf.edu']","['68/23/9935 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-2139 [doi]']",,"['P42-ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089032-04A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES009137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES09137/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2597307,['NIHMS74688'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such treatment can cure up to 100% of mice and the cured mice show long-lasting resistance to BCL1 leukemia. We show that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are required for establishment of the resistance, but only CD8+ T cells are necessary for its maintenance. BCL1 cells express MHC class I and II and also costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, which can aid eliciting of antitumor response. On the other hand, BCL1 cells also use several immunoescape mechanisms, such as expression of PD-L1, PD-L2, and interleukin-10. BCL1 cells thus can be recognized by BCL1-specific T cells, but instead of effective priming, such T cells are anergized or deleted by apoptosis. Moreover, BCL1 leukemia progression is accompanied by robust expansion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells. Although it has been shown that depletion of Treg cells in tumor-bearing mice can retard tumor growth, direct evidence that expansion of Treg cells can promote tumor growth was lacking. In this study, we provide first direct evidence that expanded Treg cells can indeed promote tumor progression by using mice with selectively expanded Treg cells before inoculation of BCL1 leukemia. Finally, we have also shown that elimination of some immunoescape mechanism (e.g., deletion of Treg) can significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of chemotherapy.","['Department of Immunology and Gnotobiology, Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, v.v.i., Prague, Czech Republic. makovar@biomed.cas.cz']","['68/23/9875 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1979 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have exploited the PTS to selectively deliver a polyamine-containing drug to cancer cells. F14512 combines an epipodophyllotoxin core-targeting topoisomerase II with a spermine moiety introduced as a cell delivery vector. The polyamine tail supports three complementary functions: (a) facilitate formulation of a water-soluble compound, (b) increase DNA binding to reinforce topoisomerase II inhibition, and (c) facilitate selective uptake by tumor cells via the PTS. F14512 is 73-fold more cytotoxic to Chinese hamster ovary cells compared with CHO-MG cells with a reduced PTS activity. A decreased sensitivity of L1210 leukemia cells to F14512 was observed in the presence of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. In parallel, the spermine moiety considerably enhances the drug-DNA interaction, leading to a reinforced inhibition of topoisomerase II. The spermine tail of F14512 serves as a cell delivery vehicle as well as a DNA anchor, and this property translates at the cellular level into a distinct pharmacologic profile. Twenty-nine human solid or hematologic cell lines were used to characterize the high cytotoxic potential of F14512 (median IC50 of 0.18 micromol/L).

Whereas imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase, is now used in frontline therapy for CML, second-generation inhibitors of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase such as nilotinib or dasatinib have been developed for the treatment of imatinib-resistant or imatinib-intolerant disease. In the current study, we generated nilotinib-resistant cell lines and investigated their mechanism of resistance. Overexpression of BCR-ABL and multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) were found among the investigated mechanisms. We showed that nilotinib is a substrate of the multidrug resistance gene product, P-glycoprotein, using verapamil or PSC833 to block binding. Up-regulated expression of p53/56 Lyn kinase, both at the mRNA and protein level, was found in one of the resistant cell lines and Lyn silencing by small interfering RNA restored sensitivity to nilotinib. Moreover, failure of nilotinib treatment was accompanied by an increase of Lyn mRNA expression in patients with resistant CML. Two Src kinase inhibitors (PP1 and PP2) partially removed resistance but did not significantly inhibit Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. In contrast, dasatinib, a dual Bcr-Abl and Src kinase inhibitor, inhibited the phosphorylation of both BCR-ABL and Lyn, and induced apoptosis of the Bcr-Abl cell line overexpressing p53/56 Lyn. Such mechanisms of resistance are close to those observed in imatinib-resistant cell lines and emphasize the critical role of Lyn in nilotinib resistance.","[""Hematopoiese Leucemique et Cible Therapeutique, INSERM U876, Universite Victor Segalen, Laboratoire d'hematologie CHU de Bordeaux, Bordeaux cedex, France.""]","['68/23/9809 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1008 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a need to identify mechanisms that contribute to retention of CML progenitors. Src family tyrosine kinases have been identified as potential mediators of Bcr-Abl-induced leukemogenesis. Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a potent dual Abl/Src kinase inhibitor approved for clinical use in CML patients. We evaluated Src activity in primitive human CML progenitors from different stages of disease and investigated effects of Dasatinib on Src activity and downstream signaling pathways. P-Src expression was increased in CD34+ cells and CD34+CD38- cells in all phases of CML. Dasatinib showed potent Src inhibitory activity in CML progenitors, inhibiting both Bcr-Abl-dependent and -independent Src activity. In contrast, Imatinib inhibited only Bcr-Abl-dependent Src activity. Dasatinib inhibited P-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), P-Akt, and P-STAT5 levels in CML progenitors in the absence of growth factors but not in the presence of growth factors. A marked increase in P-MAPK levels seen in the presence of growth factors with Imatinib was much less prominent with Dasatinib. Dasatinib significantly suppressed CML colony-forming cells and long-term culture-initiating cells but did not significantly alter the level of apoptosis-regulating proteins in CML CD34+ cells. Our results indicate that Dasatinib, in addition to potent anti-Bcr-Abl kinase activity, effectively inhibits Src kinase activity and downstream signaling pathways in CML progenitors but does not induce a strong proapoptotic response. These observations argue against a prominent role for Src kinases in persistence of primitive CML cells in TKI-treated patients.","['Department of Hematopoietic Stem Cell and Leukemia Research, City of Hope National Medical Center and Division of Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute of the City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']","['68/23/9624 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1131 [doi]']",,"['R01 HL077847/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077847-04/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5M01 RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SCD/04/CSO_/Chief Scientist Office/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA95684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'G84/6317/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'M01 RR000043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095684/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2786265,['NIHMS73273'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deregulation of this pathway results in down-regulation of apoptosis and subsequent persistence of a malignant clone. A single nucleotide polymorphism resulting in guanine-to-adenine transition in the FAS promoter region (position -1377) is thought to reduce stimulatory protein 1 transcription factor binding and decrease FAS expression. Previous work has shown increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adult patients with a variant allele at this site. The same authors have shown that the presence of an adenine residue rather than a guanine residue at -1,377 bp significantly attenuates transcription factor stimulatory protein 1 binding and may contribute to a reduction in FAS expression and ultimately to the enrichment of apoptosis-resistant clones in AML. We hypothesized that FAS genotype by altering susceptibility to apoptosis might affect outcome of childhood AML therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Four hundred forty-four children treated for de novo AML on a uniform protocol were genotyped for FAS 1377. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in overall survival, event-free survival, treatment-related mortality, or relapse rate between patients with FAS 1377GG genotype versus 1377GA/1377AA genotypes.

The mechanism of NGALR regulation is unknown. Here, we show the expression pattern of NGALR and examine the aberrant methylation of its gene in ESCC and esophageal carcinoma cell lines. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The expression pattern of NGALR was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 59 ESCCs and compared with noncancerous tissues. The DNA methylation status was investigated by methylation-specific PCR and by bisulfite genomic sequencing in esophageal carcinoma cell lines and surgically resected samples. Methylated cell lines were treated with a methylation inhibitor to restore NGALR expression. RESULTS: The expression of NGALR in ESCC was significantly higher in tumor cell membrane and cytoplasm than in normal esophageal epithelium (P < 0.01). Methylated alleles were detected in three NGALR-nonexpressing cell lines but were not detected in three NGALR-expressing cell lines. Treatment of methylated cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a methylation inhibitor, restored NGALR expression. In surgically resected samples, 31 of 77 (40.3%) primary esophageal carcinomas and 46 of 77 (59.7%) paired normal tissues contained methylated NGALR alleles (P < 0.05).

The virus encodes an oncoprotein, Tax, which functions in transcriptional regulation, cell cycle control, and transformation. Through its pleiotropic actions, Tax plays critical roles in leukemogenesis. We have previously reported that PTEN and SHIP-1, PIP3 inositol phosphatases that negatively regulate the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling cascade, are disrupted in ATLL neoplasias. Overactivation of PI3-kinase signaling has an essential role in both development of ATLL-specific nuclear polymorphisms and onset of ATLL. We report here that both PTEN and SHIP-1 are down-regulated by HTLV-I Tax through the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Tax expression up-regulated phosphorylated Akt, a downstream serine/threonine kinase in the PI3-kinase signaling cascade. Transduction of NF-kappaB p65, which mimics the activation of NF-kappaB signaling, also suppressed these phosphatases. An IkappaBDeltaN mutant that inhibits the activation of NF-kappaB prevented PIP3 phosphatase down-regulation by Tax. The underlying mechanism of NF-kappaB-mediated suppression of PIP3 phosphatases involved sequestration of the coactivator p300 by p65. These down-regulations of PIP3 phosphatases were found to be essential for the Tax-induced cell proliferation. Thus, our results suggest that HTLV-I Tax down-regulates PIP3 phosphatases through the NF-kappaB pathway, resulting in increased activation of the PI3-kinase signaling cascade in human T-cells and contributing to leukemogenesis.","['Department of Biological Science and Technology, Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan; Tissue Engineering Research Center, Research Institute of Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan; Tissue Engineering Research Center, Research Institute of Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan; Tissue Engineering Research Center, Research Institute of Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Imamura Bun-in Hospital, Kagoshima, Kagoshima 890-0064, Japan.', 'Department of Biological Science and Technology, Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan; Tissue Engineering Research Center, Research Institute of Biological Science, Tokyo University of Science, Noda, Chiba, 278-8510, Japan.

However, the potential role of up-regulated NDRG1 in the event is greatly unknown. In this work, we show that inducible NDRG1 expression can drive leukemic U937 cells to undergo differentiation, while the knock-down of NDRG1 expression by specific small interfering RNA significantly antagonizes ATRA-induced differentiation of leukemic cells, proposing the role of NDRG1 in leukemic cell differentiation. Furthermore, our work shows that CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) and PU.1, which are important hematopoiesis-related transcription factors, may act as downstream effectors of NDRG1 in leukemic cell differentiation. Taking together, this study provides direct evidence for the role of NDRG1 protein in myeloid leukemic cell differentiation.","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Luwan, Shanghai, China.']","['S0145-2126(08)00477-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.10.016 [doi]']",20081128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic anaemia, it is a physiological response to increased erythropoietin. In some other conditions, such as myeloid metaplasia, polycythaemia vera or chronic myeloid leukaemia, EH is due to a clonal disorder of haematopoiesis that enables progenitor cells to escape from the marrow and lodge in other organs. EH usually involves the liver, spleen and lymph nodes or it can be paravertebral, intrathoracic, pelvic. It is often asymptomatic but can sometimes lead to symptomatic tumour-like masses. Treatment options are still controversial and limited, including hypertransfusion regimen, surgical treatment, radiotherapy and hydroxyurea (HU). We describe intrathoracic and symptomatic pelvic EH masses in a 48-year-old woman and intrathoracic bilateral masses causing respiratory insufficiency with pleural effusion in a 42-year-old male, both affected by thalassaemia intermedia.

ATL cells grew in close contact with MS-5 layers and formed so-called ""cobblestone areas"" (CAs) without the addition of IL-2. In clinical samples, eight of ten (80.0%) cases of acute or lymphoma type ATL cells formed CAs. The frequency of CA forming cells in ATL cells ranged from 0.03 to 1.04%. The morphology, immunophenotyping, and DNA analysis indicated that cells composing CA were compatible with ATL cells, and clonally identical to primary CD4-positive ATL cells. Furthermore, in ATL cells composing CA, the expression of p40Tax was down-regulated in transcriptional and translational level, while that of HTLV-I basic leucine zipper factor (HBZ) gene was comparable to the level of primary ATL cells, resembling expression pattern of proviral genes in in vivo ATL cells. By microarray analysis, several genes which coded products involved in cell-cell interaction, and cellular survival and proliferation, were differentially expressed in ATL cells composing CA compared with primary samples. In conclusion, our co-culture system allows for the first time the growth of primary ATL cells in vitro, and might be useful as an in vitro assay for biological and clinical studies to develop molecular targeting drugs against ATL.","['Transfusion Service, Nagasaki University Hospital of Medicine and Dentistry, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan. agwkn@nagasaki-u.ac.jp.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Saitama Medical School, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Immunology, Graduate School and Faculty of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, Okinawa, Japan.', 'Department of Histology and Cell Biology, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Transfusion Service, Nagasaki University Hospital of Medicine and Dentistry, 1-7-1 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan.']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0207-z [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0207-z [pii]']",20081202,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A feasibility study is presented of the standard strategy for the identification of Ig/TCR targets for MRD diagnostics in Polish ALL patients by identifying Ig/TCR gene rearrangement pattern using standard primer sets and protocols. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The PCR-heteroduplex approach based on BIOMED-1 and BIOMED-2 protocols (recommended as the European standard) was used to detect IGH, IGK-Kde, TCRD, TCRG, and TCRB rearrangements in 58 Polish B-cell precursor ALL patients. Sequencing and homology analysis between the obtained and germline Ig/TCR sequences enabled identification of the rearrangements. The U-Gauss test was used for statistical analysis of the Ig/TCR rearrangement pattern in Polish patients compared with relevant data on other nationalities. RESULTS: The following pattern was identified: IGH: 83% (VH-JH: 74%, DH-JH: 9%), IGK-Kde: 41%, TCRD: 78% (incomplete TCRD: 55%, Vdelta2-Ddelta3: 45%, Ddelta2-Ddelta3: 21%, Vdelta2-Jalpha: 35%), TCRG: 50%, and TCRB: 13%. Considerable convergence of the Ig/TCR pattern in Polish patients and those of other nationalities (mainly West Europeans) was demonstrated. Statistically relevant differences were only found between the incidence of DH-JH in Polish (9%) and Dutch patients (24%; p<0.05) and Polish and Italian patients (19%; p<0.05), VH-JH in Polish (74%) and Chilean patients (100%; p<0.05), and TCRG in Polish (50%) and Brazilian patients (69%; p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The convergence of Ig/TCR patterns in Polish and European patients indicates that the strategy for Ig/TCR target identification based on standard primers and protocols might be directly used for the construction of Polish standards and recommendations for MRD diagnostics.","['Department of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, Polish Academy of Sciences, Strzeszynska 32, 60-479 Poznan, Poland. ma.dawidowska@wp.pl']",['10.1007/s00005-008-0045-y [doi]'],20081201,,PMC2805919,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In these tumors, the hematopoietic insertion of an active AKV murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is associated with the onset of disease. Common sites of retroviral insertion (CIS) identify genes causally associated with the development or initiation of lymphoma. METHODOLOGY: In the present study, we analyzed a previously uncharacterized CIS, Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 32 (Evi32), which is located on mouse chromosome 1. We analyzed candidate genes in the region to identify those involved in Evi32 mediated oncogenesis. RESULTS: Here we show that proviral insertion at Evi32 correlates with significant overexpression of a putative transcription factor, PR-domain containing 14 (Prdm14). Tumors with insertions at Evi32 are consistently lymphoid in nature. Prdm14 is normally expressed early in embryonic development with the highest expression in undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells. This study implicates Prdm14 as a proto-oncogene involved in lymphoblastic lymphoma formation.","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, United States of America.']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003823 [doi]'],20081127,"['R01 CA063229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA63229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2584371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML1/ETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by directly targeting AML1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation determined by AML1/ETO probably relies on a more complex network, since the fusion protein has been shown to interact with a number of other transcription factors, in particular E-proteins, and may therefore target other sites on DNA. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling were exploited to identify AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML1/ETO was found to co-localize with AML1, demonstrating that the fusion protein follows the binding pattern of the wild-type protein but does not function primarily by displacing it. The DNA binding profile of the E-protein HEB was grossly rearranged upon expression of AML1/ETO, and the fusion protein was found to co-localize with both AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO.

This enzyme helps to regulate DNA under- and overwinding and removes knots and tangles from the genetic material. In order to carry out its critical physiological functions, topoisomerase II generates transient double-stranded breaks in DNA. Consequently, while necessary for cell survival, the enzyme also has the capacity to fragment the genome. The DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II is the target for some of the most successful anticancer drugs currently in clinical use. However, this same reaction also is believed to trigger chromosomal translocations that are associated with specific types of leukemia. This article will familiarize the reader with the DNA cleavage/ligation reaction of topoisomerase II and other aspects of its catalytic cycle. In addition, it will discuss the interaction of the enzyme with anticancer drugs and the mechanisms by which these agents increase levels of topoisomerase II-generated DNA strand breaks.

Improved treatment is likely to come from increasing the time to relapse, especially for younger patients. With the vastly increasing number of targeted therapies there is a strong need for short-term end-points to efficiently test such therapies for further pursuance. Minimal residual disease assessment may offer such an end-point since it is a strong independent prognostic factor. As proof of principle we examined this concept for FLT3-ITD status at diagnosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: We determined FLT3-ITD status in bone marrow samples from 196 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia. The frequencies of residual leukemic cells of these 196 patients were assessed in 267 follow-up bone marrow samples using immunophenotypic assessment of minimal residual disease. RESULTS: The median frequency of residual leukemic cells after the first cycle of chemotherapy was 8.5-fold higher in patients with FLT3-ITD than in those with wild type FLT3. Such a difference translates into differences in survival, even if other potentially outcome-modulating mutations, such as NPM1, KIT, NRAS, KRAS, FLT3-exon 20 and PTPN11 are included in the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that it could be possible to study the efficacy of FLT3 inhibitors using the level of minimal residual disease as a short-term end-point.","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']","['haematol.13110 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13110 [doi]']",20081127,,PMC2625416,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meyer Radix rubra) has been used to treat various diseases including cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for KRG extract induced apoptosis and telomerase inhibition remain unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The hot water extract from KRG was used to evaluate the mechanism of induction of apoptosis in U937 human leukemia cells and its effects on cyclooxgenase-2 (COX-2) and telomerase activity. RESULTS: KRG extract treatment to U937 cells resulted in growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner as measured by hemacytometer counts, MTT assay, fluorescence microscopy, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis. The increase in apoptosis was associated with the down-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), and IAPs family members, and the activation of caspase-3.

Furthermore, KRG extract treatment progressively down-regulated the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase, a main determinant of the telomerase enzymatic activity, with inhibiting the expression of c-Myc in a concentration-dependent manner.

However, there are major limitations to RIC HCT. Some of these limitations may be able to be overcome, broadening the impact of allogeneic RIC HCT for older patients with AML.

Cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) is a newly designed transduction peptide that carries molecules across the cell membrane with a preference to localize in the cytoplasmic compartment and is, therefore, applicable for cytoplasmic targeting. The Bcr-Abl fusion protein, playing major causative role in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), is a cytoplasmic oncoprotein that contains an N-terminus oligomerization domain (OD) mediating homodimerization of Bcr-Abl proteins, and an intact OD in Bcr-Abl is required both for the activation of its transforming activity and tyrosine kinase. Therefore, disrupting Bcr-Abl oligomerization represents a potential therapeutic strategy for inhibiting Bcr-Abl oncogenicity. In this study, we explored the possible homodimerization-disrupting and tyrosine kinase inhibiting effect of the transduction of OD in Bcr-Abl positive K562 cells. By expressing in Escherichia coli a CTP-OD-HA fusion protein followed by Ni+-NTA affinity purification, immunoblot identification and enterokinase cleavage, we showed that the CTP-OD-HA protein was structurally and functionally active in that it potently transduced and primarily localized into the cytoplasmic compartment, heterodimerized with Bcr-Abl, and potently inhibited the phospho-tyrosine pathways of Bcr-Abl oncoprotein at a low concentration of 4 microM. These results delineate strategies for the expression and purification of therapeutic molecules for intracytoplasmic protein based therapeutics and the CTP-OD-HA-mediated killing strategy could be explored as a promising anti-leukemia agent or an adjuvant to the conventional therapeutic modalities in chronic myeloid leukemia, such as in vitro purging.","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Key Laboratory of Laboratory Medical Diagnostics Designated by the Ministry of Education, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, PR China.']","['S1046-5928(08)00296-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pep.2008.10.023 [doi]']",20081117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For some feline viruses, notably the immunodeficiency virus, leukaemia virus and peritonitis virus, available vaccines are poorly efficacious but there are good prospects for this. A further challenge for the industry is likely to be due to viruses jumping species and the emergence of more virulent variants of established viruses resulting from mutations as has been the case for the canine parvovirus, coronaviruses and feline calicivirus.","['JAS Biologicals Limited, The Centre for Veterinary Science, Madingley Road, Cambridge CB3OES, UK. jasltd@aol.com <jasltd@aol.com>']","['S0264-410X(08)01552-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.vaccine.2008.11.027 [doi]']",20081127,,PMC7130499,,,153,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DS patients have a variety of pathologies, including mental retardation and an unusually high incidence of leukemia or lymphoma such as megakaryocytic leukemia. Individuals with DS develop the characteristic neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in early adulthood, generally by the fourth decade of life. There are several mouse models of DS that have a segmental trisomy of mouse chromosome 16 (MMU 16) with triplicated genes orthologous to HSA 21. These mice display neurodegeneration similar to DS. Although brain pathology in DS models is known, little information is available about other organs. We studied the extraneural pathology in aged DS mice (Ts65Dn, Ts2 and Ts1Cje aged 8 to 24 months) as well as other mouse models of neurodegeneration, including presenilin (PS), amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and tau (hTau and JNPL) transgenic mice. An increased incidence of peripheral amyloidosis, positive for amyloid A (AA) but not amyloid-beta peptide (A beta), was found in APP over-expressing and tauopathic mice as compared to non-transgenic (ntg) littermates or to DS mouse models. A higher incidence of lymphoma was found in the DS models, including Ts1Cje that is trisomic for a small segment of MMU 16 not including the App gene, but not in the APP over-expressing mice, suggesting that high APP expression is not the cause of lymphoma in DS. The occurrence of lymphomas in mouse DS models is of interest in relation to the increased incidence of malignant conditions in human DS.","['Center for Dementia Research, Nathan S.

During acute treatment, seizures were not uncommon. The development of intractable epilepsy years after treatment, however, has not been well described in the literature. We describe five patients who were treated for acute lymphocytic leukemia as children, who later developed intractable epilepsy. RESULTS: All of the patients were diagnosed with leukemia before age seven. Treatment included both whole-brain irradiation and intrathecal chemotherapy. All five received intrathecal methotrexate; in addition, two also received intrathecal cytosine arabinoside. The first seizure occurred at a mean of 7.5 years after diagnosis. Four patients have multiple seizure types, and all patients have been on multiple antiepileptic drugs. All five patients are cognitively impaired. CONCLUSIONS: Successful treatment for childhood leukemia may be followed by signs of late cerebral injury including intractable epilepsy. We propose that neurotoxicity resulting from exposure to intrathecal methotrexate and cranial irradiation may have contributed to the intractable epilepsy seen in our five patients.","['Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center, 1725 W.

We studied cancer survival among children of Turkish descent in the German Cancer Childhood Registry, one of the largest childhood cancer registries worldwide. METHODS: We identified children of Turkish descent among cancer cases using a name-based approach. We compared 5-year survival probabilities of Turkish and other children in three time periods of diagnosis (1980-87, 1988-95, 1996-2005) using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests. RESULTS: The 5-year survival probability for all cancers among 1774 cases of Turkish descent (4.76% of all 37.259 cases) was 76.9% compared to 77.6% in the comparison group (all other cases; p = 0.15). We found no age- or sex-specific survival differences (p-values between p = 0.18 and p = 0.90). For the period 1980-87, the 5-year survival probability among Turkish children with lymphoid leukaemia was significantly lower (62% versus 75.8%; p < 0.0001), this remains unexplained. For more recently diagnosed leukaemias, we saw no survival differences for Turkish and non-Turkish children. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that nowadays Turkish migrant status has no bearing on the outcome of childhood cancer therapies in Germany. The inclusion of currently more than 95% of all childhood cancer cases in standardised treatment protocols is likely to contribute to this finding.","['German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR), Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), Mainz, Germany. spix@imbei.uni-mainz.de']","['1471-2407-8-355 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2407-8-355 [doi]']",20081128,,PMC2628927,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2008 Nov 26.,,10.1111/j.1537-2995.2008.02008.x [doi],"BACKGROUND: A case of donor cell leukemia (DCL) is reported. A 42-year-old female developed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) of donor cell origin 18 months after a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from her brother. At the time DCL presented, the donor-brother was also diagnosed with AML showing identical cytogenetic abnormalities. The classification of DCL and recommendations for laboratory testing of potential hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) donors are discussed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Marrow specimens were obtained from the posterior iliac crest and analyzed using standard techniques. Leukemic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization were performed using standard methods. RESULTS: The recipient-sister's original diagnosis was erythroleukemia. Chromosome analysis showed a 46,XX,t(3;5)(q25;q34) karyotype. Both the recipient's new AML and the donor's AML showed an identical karyotype: 46,XY,inv(3)(q21q26),-7. Both patients were resistant to therapy and died. CONCLUSION: The clinical and biological aspects of DCL are discussed including the distinction between transformation of healthy donor cells to leukemic cells and transmission of preformed leukemic cells. The former represents almost all the reported cases of DCL compared with transmission of leukemic cells from donor to recipient. With an aging donor population, it is estimated that the latter will increase. Increased testing of older donors to include routine morphologic study of blood and marrow, cytogenetic studies, and evaluation for clonal lymphoproliferative disorders is recommended.","['Department of Pathology, Rhode Island Hospital and Brown Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island, USA.

METHODS: CDC was investigated in 119 AL patients who received induction chemotherapy from August 2004 to May 2005. Clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, imaging modalities, diagnosis and treatment were investigated retrospectively. RESULTS: Three patients (2.5%) were identified to be suffering from CDC. All the three patients had an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <0. 5 x 10(9)/L for more than 15 days. Two patients had normal ANC when they were diagnosed to have CDC. The common manifestations in these three patients were persistent fever, splenohepatomegalia and percussion pain in hepatic region. Meanwhile, 2 of them were accompanied with cough, expectoration and dyspnoea. The abnormal laboratory test observed during the course of infection in two of them was increase of alkaline phosphatase. Computed tomography scan showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver and spleen in all the three patients; two of them showed multiple nodular patchy shadows in lungs. Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging showed multiple abnormal signal in liver, spleen and kidneys in one of the patients. Two patients had positive bleed fungal cultures and histologic examination in one of the patients were positive for Candida tropicalis. Two patients received amphotericin B therapy empirically, but it was replaced by amphotericin B colloid dispersion (ABCD) later in one and combined with voriconazole in another because of unresponsiveness to the drug. One patient took a favorable turn after receiving ABCD therapy for 45 d, which was replaced by voriconazole because of the emergence of fever after discontinuation of ABCD. All the three patients received further chemotherapy smoothly after the diagnosis of CDC. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of CDC remains difficult. Fungal blood cultures and histologic examination have been considered in many studies as the golden standard for the diagnosis of CDC. Amphotericin B is the cornerstone of treatment in patients with CDC and lipid formulations of amphotericin B can be used in CDC patients who are intolerant of or refractory to conventional amphotericin B. Voriconazole has a favorable response for refractory/relapse patients and could be used for second line treatment. The development of CDC in patients with acute leukemia does not preclude further chemotherapy.","['Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, the Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China. xbzj@fimmu.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The consecutive samples of 435 patients with MDS in Sino-US Shanghai Leukemia Cooperative Group were collected prospectively and diagnosed with WHO classification. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using chromosome G-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques. RESULTS: The median onset age in the patients was 58 (18-90) years. The proportion of cases with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) was highest ,accounting for 69.6% (303/435). Other subtypes were refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) 24.1% (105/435), refractory anemia (RA) 2.3% (10/435), myelodysplastic syndrome, unclassifiable (MDS-U) 2.3% (10/435), refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RAS) 1.2% (5/435) and 5q-syndrome 0.5% (2/435) in turn. The proportions of RA, RAS and 5q-syndrome were higher in western countries and RCMD subtype was lower. Eleven cases had failure of chromosome analysis. In the remaining 424 cases with success the frequency of chromosome abnormality was 38.7%, with the highest in RAEB- I (62.5%), and then RAEB-II (48.4%) and RCMD (34.5%) in turn. The sequence of common chromosome abnormalities was + 8 (12.7% ), complex karyotype (9.0%), chromosome translocation (7.8%), - 20q (6.6%), -7/-7q (5.2%), -5/-5q (4.2%) and- Y(2.4%), while the sequential order in western countries -5/-5q, -7/-7q, +8, 11q and 12p/12q.

Seventeen patients had normal chromosome examination because of lower percentage of abnormal cells. However, the detection sensitivity of abnormality with FISH may sometimes be high. CONCLUSIONS: The WHO subtype and chromosome abnormality distributions of MDS in Shanghai were different from those in western countries. The combination of FISH and conventional chromosome examination could improve the detection sensitivity.","['Hematology Department, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai 200040, China. wangxiaoqin@shmu.edu.cn']",,,,,,,,,['Sino-US Shanghai Leukemia Cooperative Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two C6-unsubstituted (1 and 2) and eight C6-substituted compounds (3-10) were selected and assayed for their effects on the Ba/F3 cell line transducing the wild-type p210Bcr-Abl construct, which is IM-sensitive, or three of the most common mutations associated with IM resistance in vivo (T315I, Y253F, and E255K), and driven to drug resistance by saturating doses of IL-3 or by the expression of the Bcr-Abl construct coding for the p185 protein of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Compounds 1 and 2 were active against all cell lines assayed (LD(50) range: 0.7-4.3 microM), whereas C6-substituted compounds exhibited lower activity (LD(50) approximately 8 microM for compound 3 toward the T315I mutant). Notably, 1 and 2 were also effective toward the T315I mutation, which is insensitive to dual Src/Abl inhibitors. The cytotoxic effects of 1 and 2 on IM-sensitive and IM-resistant Ba/F3 cells were attributable, at least in part, to their pro-apoptotic activity.

Our results implicate that the sorted and purified stem cells are useful for more sensitive quantification of BCR-ABL-positive minimal residual disease.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan. aakihiro@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ichinomiya Municipal Hospital, Ichinomiya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine and Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya, 466-8550, Japan.']","['10.1007/s12185-008-0221-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0221-1 [pii]']",20081129,"['R01 CA043054/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA043054-22/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2626150,['NIHMS86110'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of MSD therapy in differentiated metastatic thyroid cancers that persisted after conventional fixed dose therapy is investigated. METHODS: Forty-seven differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients with non-responsive residual disease despite repetitive fixed dose I-131 therapy were enrolled in this study. Their postoperative pathologies were 43 papillary carcinomas and 4 follicular carcinomas. The MSD was calculated with the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center protocol using serial blood samples. The MSDs were administered at intervals of 6 months. Treatment responses were evaluated using I-131 whole-body scans and serum thyroglobulin measurements. RESULTS: The mean calculated MSD was 12.5 +/- 2.1 GBq (339.6 +/- 57.5 mCi). Of the 46 patients, 7 (14.9%) showed complete remission, 15 (31.9%) partial remission, 19 (40.4%) stable disease, and 6 (12.8%) disease progression. Of the patients who showed complete or partial remission, 15 (65%) showed response after the first MSD session and 6 (26%) showed response after the second session. Twenty-nine patients (62%) experienced transient cytopenia after therapy, but three did not recover to the baseline level. CONCLUSIONS: The maximal safe dose provides an effective means of treatment in patients who failed to respond adequately to conventional fixed dose therapy. I-131 MSD therapy can be considered in patients who fail fixed dose therapy.","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 28 Yongon-dong, Chongno-gu, Seoul, 110-744, South Korea.']",['10.1007/s12149-007-0179-8 [doi]'],20081128,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Encapsulation in Q[6] and Q[7] increased the aqueous solubility of albendazole by 2000-fold, from 3 microM to 6 mM at pH 6.6, while Q[8]-encapsulation increased the solubility to over 2 mM. Encapsulation in Q[7] and Q[8] induced significant upfield shifts for the albendazole propyl and benzimidazole resonances, compared to those observed for Q[6]-binding and what would normally be expected for the respective functional groups. The upfield shifts indicate that the albendazole propyl and benzimidazole protons are located within the Q[7] and Q[8] cavity upon encapsulation. Alternatively, encapsulation in Q[6] only induced a large upfield shift for the albendazole carbamate methyl resonance, indicating that the drug associates with Q[6] at its portals, with only the carbamate group within the cavity. Simple molecular models based on the observed relative changes in chemical shift could be constructed that were consistent with the conclusions from the NMR experiments.

Thus, resistance to apoptosis can contribute to the development of leukemia or lymphoma. Inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins block cell death pathways at a central node by interfering with the activation of effector caspases. As increased expression levels of IAPs are found in hematological malignancies and have been correlated with poor prognosis, IAPs could be exploited as therapeutic targets and prognostic markers. Various strategies have been developed to target IAPs for therapeutic purposes in leukemia and lymphoma cells, including small-molecule inhibitors and antisense oligonucleotides. These agents could directly induce apoptosis in malignant cells or sensitize these cells to other cytotoxic agents. Thus, IAPs present promising targets for the development of new biomarkers and cancer therapeutics in hematological malignancies.","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. simone.fulda@uniklinik-ulm.de""]","['leu2008329 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.329 [doi]']",20081127,,,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular localization of key proteins of the telomere-localized shelterin complex, the mitotic spindle and double-stranded DNA breaks was also analyzed. RS cells show significantly shorter and significantly fewer telomeres in relation to the total nuclear volume when compared with H cells; in particular, telomere-poor 'ghost' nuclei are often adjacent to one or two nuclei displaying huge telomeric aggregates. Shelterin proteins are mainly cytoplasmic in both H and RS cells, whereas double-stranded DNA breaks accumulate in the nuclei of RS cells. In RS cells, multipolar spindles prevent proper chromosome segregation. In conclusion, a process of nuclear disorganization seems to initiate in H cells and further progresses when the cells turn into RS cells and become end-stage tumor cells, unable to divide further because of telomere loss, shortening and aggregate formation, extensive DNA damage and aberrant mitotic spindles that may no longer sustain chromosome segregation.

A comparison of bosutinib with dasatinib across the whole kinase panel revealed overlapping, but distinct, inhibition profiles. Common among those were the SRC, ABL and TEC family kinases. Bosutinib did not inhibit KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor, but prominently targeted the apoptosis-linked STE20 kinases.

However, some rare cases have atypical breakpoints. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a CML patient with a unique e8a2 BCR-ABL transcript variant. It contained the first 114 nucleotides of BCR exon 8, with an insertion of 16 nucleotides from the 3' end of ABL intron 1a, followed by ABL exon 2. Due to her uncontrolled thrombocytosis after 3 years of interferon-alpha treatment, the patient received imatinib at a dosage of 400 mg/day. Though achieving a sustained and complete hematological response after 3 months, she was resistant to imatinib during the entire 65-month imatinib treatment. That is, she failed to achieve major cytogenetic response and there was no significant decrease in her BCR-ABL transcript levels. Meanwhile, an M351T mutant was detected at 18 months after the start of imatinib treatment. CONCLUSION: ABL point mutation is also a mechanism of imatinib resistance for CML patients with the BCR-ABL transcript variant.","[""Peking University Institute of Hematology, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]","['000178145 [pii]', '10.1159/000178145 [doi]']",20081128,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 S.

The morphology of the leukemia cells became myelomonoblastic, and some were immunohistochemically positive for lysozyme, suggesting AML.

To explore the genetic basis of relapse, we performed genome-wide DNA copy number analyses on matched diagnosis and relapse samples from 61 pediatric patients with ALL. The diagnosis and relapse samples typically showed different patterns of genomic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), with the CNAs acquired at relapse preferentially affecting genes implicated in cell cycle regulation and B cell development. Most relapse samples lacked some of the CNAs present at diagnosis, which suggests that the cells responsible for relapse are ancestral to the primary leukemia cells. Backtracking studies revealed that cells corresponding to the relapse clone were often present as minor subpopulations at diagnosis. These data suggest that genomic abnormalities contributing to ALL relapse are selected for during treatment, and they point to new targets for therapeutic intervention.","[""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]","['322/5906/1377 [pii]', '10.1126/science.1164266 [doi]']",,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-30/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2746051,['NIHMS93672'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We profiled gene expression in pretreatment biopsy specimens from 181 patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma who received CHOP and 233 patients with this disease who received R-CHOP. A multivariate gene-expression-based survival-predictor model derived from a training group was tested in a validation group. RESULTS: A multivariate model created from three gene-expression signatures--termed ""germinal-center B-cell,"" ""stromal-1,"" and ""stromal-2""--predicted survival both in patients who received CHOP and patients who received R-CHOP. The prognostically favorable stromal-1 signature reflected extracellular-matrix deposition and histiocytic infiltration. By contrast, the prognostically unfavorable stromal-2 signature reflected tumor blood-vessel density.

A potential of TRAIL as a cancer-specific therapeutic agent has been proposed, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy. Prolonged exposure of TRAIL-sensitive leukemia cell line, wild-type (WT) HL60 cells to recombinant soluble TRAIL or to cytostatic agents, cytarabine and idarubicin, resulted in the establishment of resistant subclones with distinct phenotypic features. The TRAIL resistant HL60 subclones were characterized by decreased expression of TRAIL and TNFalpha death receptors. These resistant subclones had impaired activation of caspases 8 and 10 in response to TRAIL and TNFalpha, decreased TRAIL-induced nuclear translocation of NFkappaB RelA/p65, and dysregulation of the expression of several apoptosis regulators. Among the TRAIL resistant HL60 subclones we identified two separate phenotypes that differed in the expression of CD14, osteoprotegerin, and several apoptosis regulators. Both these TRAIL resistant HL60 subclones were resistant to TNFalpha, suggesting disruption of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, but not to cytostatic agents, cytarabine and idarubicin. The concurrently derived HL60 subclones were cytarabine and idarubicin-resistant but remained sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

We here demonstrate that genistein causes G(2)/M cycle arrest and expression of differentiation markers in human acute myeloid leukaemia cells (HL60, NB4), and cooperates with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in inducing differentiation, while ATRA attenuates the isoflavone-provoked toxicity. Genistein rapidly stimulates Raf-1, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation, but does not stimulate and instead causes a late decrease in Akt phosphorylation/activation which is attenuated by ATRA. Both differentiation and G(2)/M arrest are attenuated by MEK/ERK inhibitors (PD98059, U0126) and ERK1-/ERK2-directed small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, but not by the p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580. Genistein stimulates p21(waf1/cip1) and cyclin B1 expression, phosphorylation/activation of ATM and Chk2 kinases, and Tyr15-phosphorylation/inactivation of Cdc2 (Cdk1) kinase, and these effects are attenuated by MEK/ERK inhibitors, while LY294002 also attenuates ERK and ATM phosphorylation. Caffeine abrogates the genistein-provoked G(2)/M blockade and alterations in cell cycle regulatory proteins, and also suppresses differentiation. Finally, genistein causes reactive oxygen species (ROS) over-accumulation, but the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine fails to prevent ERK activation, G(2)/M arrest, and differentiation induction. By contrast, N-acetyl-L-cysteine and p38-MAPK inhibitor attenuate the apoptosis-sensitizing (pro-apoptotic) action of genistein when combined with the antileukaemic agent arsenic trioxide. In summary, genistein-induced differentiation in acute myeloid leukaemia cells is a ROS-independent, Raf-1/MEK/ERK-mediated and PI3K-dependent response, which is coupled and co-regulated with G(2)/M arrest, but uncoupled to the pro-apoptotic action of the drug.","['Centro de Investigaciones Biologicas, Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Ramiro de Maeztu 9, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']","['S0006-2952(08)00785-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.10.035 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently proposed a cyclophosphamide-using non-myeloablative cell therapy in which donor lymphocytes infusion (DLI) was carried out after tolerance induction to donor cells. In this study, we tested the possibility that the cyclophosphamide-using cell therapy could be augmented by pre-immunization of donors before DLI. We initially assessed whether or not the cyclophosphamide-using cell therapy could also show antitumor effect against subcutaneously established colon 26 carcinoma. As a tumor antigen-derived peptide for colon 26, we used AH1, an immunodominant H-2Ld-binding peptide derived from the envelope protein (gp70) of an endogenous murine leukemia virus. The cyclophosphamide-using cell therapy with the DLI from donors which were pre-immunized with the AH1 peptide was compared with that from non-immunized mice. The cyclophosphamide-using cell therapy significantly suppressed subcutaneously established colon 26 carcinoma, and the tumor-rejected mice acquired the tumor-specific protective immunity. When combined with the DLI from donors that were immunized with AH1, antitumor effect of the cyclophosphamide-using cell therapy was significantly augmented. The DLI from tumor peptide-immunized donors showed no influence on donor chimerism and bodyweight of the treated mice, indicating no increased risk of graft-versus-host disease. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes could be generated from tumor-rejected mice. Our results indicate that the cyclophosphamide-using non-myeloablative cell therapy with the DLI from tumor peptide-immunized donors is a useful protocol to augment graft-versus-tumor effect without exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease.","['Department of Urology, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, and Center for Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, 3-1-1 Maidashi, Higashi-ku, Fukuoka 812-8582, Japan.']","['CAS1014 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.01014.x [doi]']",20081124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bufadienolides are extracts of toxic glands from toads and are used as anticancer agents, mainly on leukemia cells. In the present study, the antiproliferative and apoptotic mechanisms of bufalin and cinobufagin on prostate cancer cells were investigated. Proliferation of LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 cells was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yle)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and the doubling time (tD) was calculated. Bufalin and cinobufagin caused changes in the tD of three prostate cancer cell lines, which were more significant than that of human mesangial cells. In addition, bufadienolides induced prostate cancer cell apoptosis more significantly than that in breast epithelial cell lines. After treatment, the caspase-3 activity and protein expression of caspase-3, -8, and -9 were elevated. The expression of other apoptotic modulators, including mitochondrial Bax and cytosolic cytochrome c, were also increased. However, expression of p53 was only enhanced in LNCaP cells. Downregulation of p53 by antisense TP53 restored the cell viability suppressed by bufalienolides. Furthermore, the increased expression of Fas was more significant in DU145 and PC3 cells with mutant p53 than in LNCaP cells. Transfection of Fas small interfering RNA restored cell viability in the bufadienolide-treated cells. These results suggest that bufalin and cinobufagin suppress cell proliferation and cause apoptosis in prostate cancer cells via a sequence of apoptotic modulators, including Bax, cytochrome c, and caspases. The upstream mediators might be p53 and Fas in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells and Fas in androgen-independent DU145 and PC3 cells.","['Department of Physiology, School of Medicine, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan.']","['CAS966 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00966.x [doi]']",20081126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that CML phenotype and biology can be established in mice by restricting BCR-ABLp210 expression to stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1)(+) cells. The course of the disease in Sca1-BCR-ABLp210 mice was not modified on STI571 treatment. However, BCR-ABLp210-induced CML is reversible through the unique elimination of the cancer stem cells (CSCs). Overall, our data show that oncogene expression in Sca1(+) cells is all that is required to fully reprogramme it, giving rise to a full-blown, oncogene-specified tumour with all its mature cellular diversity, and that elimination of the CSCs is enough to eradicate the whole tumour.","['Experimental Therapeutics and Translational Oncology Program, Instituto de Biologia Molecular y Celular del Cancer, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']","['emboj2008253 [pii]', '10.1038/emboj.2008.253 [doi]']",20081127,,PMC2600654,,['EMBO J. 2009 Feb 4;28(3):167-8.

To determine if Mcl-1 has a specific role in normal keratinocyte (KC) biology, Mcl-1 was downregulated in human KCs by RNAi and these KCs were induced to differentiate in organotypic raft cultures. Mcl-1 shRNA organotypic cultures showed increased levels of spontaneous premature apoptosis, implicating Mcl-1 as an essential KC survival protein. Mcl-1-downregulated cultures also had reduced granular and cornified layers, and produced lower levels of cross-linked protein and cornified envelopes. Cornification could only partially be rescued with the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD, suggesting that reduced cornification was not entirely because of premature apoptosis. Differentiation markers (K1, K10, filaggrin, loricrin, cleaved caspase-14) were normally expressed in control organotypic cultures, but were expressed at reduced levels in organotypic cultures with downregulated Mcl-1. The defect in differentiation marker expression was independent of apoptosis as it could not be rescued by z-VAD. Thus, Mcl-1 serves two important, independent functions in epidermal KCs: acting as a major survival protein by inhibiting premature apoptosis in the spinous and granular layers to promote conification, and promoting the robust induction of KC differentiation markers.","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, Illinois 60153, USA.']","['S0022-202X(15)34370-0 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2008.363 [doi]']",,"['R01 CA083784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA083784-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA083784/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2773513,['NIHMS152651'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our new genome-wide analysis of the integration profile of a recombinant PERV (PERV A/C), enabled us to examine more than 1,900 integration sites and identify 224 integration hot spots. Investigation of the possible genome features involved in hot-spot formation revealed that the expression level of the genes did not influence distribution of the integration sites of gammaretroviruses (PERV and MLV) or the formation of integration hot spots. However, PERV integration and the presence of hot spots was found to be greater in areas of the genome with high densities of genes with CpG islands. Surprisingly, this was not true for MLV. Simulation of integration profiles revealed that retrovirus integration studies involving the use of the restriction enzyme MseI (widely used in genome integration studies of MLV and gammaretroviral vector) underestimated integration near CpG islands and in gene-dense areas. These results suggest that the integration of gammaretrovirus or gammaretroviral vectors might occur preferentially in genome areas that are highly enriched in genes under CpG island promoter regulation.","['AFSSA-LERAPP, Ploufragan, France.']","['JVI.00856-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00856-08 [doi]']",20081126,,PMC2643786,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that small molecule inhibitors of the antiapoptotic protein XIAP cooperate with TRAIL to induce apoptosis in childhood acute leukemia cells. XIAP inhibitors at subtoxic concentrations, but not a structurally related control compound, synergize with TRAIL to trigger apoptosis and to inhibit clonogenic survival of acute leukemia cells, whereas they do not affect viability of normal peripheral blood lymphocytes, suggesting some tumor selectivity. Analysis of signaling pathways reveals that XIAP inhibitors enhance TRAIL-induced activation of caspases, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and cytochrome c release in a caspase-dependent manner, indicating that they promote a caspase-dependent feedback mitochondrial amplification loop. Of note, XIAP inhibitors even overcome Bcl-2-mediated resistance to TRAIL by enhancing Bcl-2 cleavage and Bak conformational change. Importantly, XIAP inhibitors kill leukemic blasts from children with ALL ex vivo and cooperate with TRAIL to induce apoptosis. In vivo, they significantly reduce leukemic burden in a mouse model of pediatric ALL engrafted in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Thus, XIAP inhibitors present a promising novel approach for apoptosis-based therapy of childhood ALL.","[""University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany.""]","['S0006-4971(20)37673-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2007-09-114314 [doi]']",20081125,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The emergence of MDR is multi-factorial. Among them, the MDR1 gene/P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a popular and important reason. In our study, an MDR1 single-factorial drug-resistant leukemia cell line K562/MDR1 was constructed via transferring full-length human MDR1 cDNA into drug-sensitive K562 cells. The short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting MDR1 gene was transfected into K562/MDR1 cell lines by the replication-defective lentiviral vector derived from HIV-1. The efficiency of RNA interference (RNAi) to silence the MDR1 gene and reverse multidrug-resistance in the MDR1 single-factor drug-resistance cell line K562/MDR1 was evaluated. The multi-factor resistant cell line K562/A02, induced by doxorubicin exposure, was used as a control. After RNA interference, the expression of the MDR1 gene and P-gp in K562/MDR1 was markedly down-regulated and the drug sensitivity was restored as IC(50) values became similar to the K562 sensitive cell line. The expression of the MDR1 gene and P-gp in K562/A02 was markedly down-regulated too, and drug-resistance to anticancer drug is reduced to some extent but the IC(50) was significantly higher than that of the sensitive cell line. These results demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated RNAi could efficiently down-regulate the expression of MDR1 and Pgp, and successfully reverse a cell's resistance to chemotherapeutic. Due to only MDR1 resistance, the K562/MDR1 cell showed much high specificity and thus is a better cell model for MDR1/P-gp research.","['Department of Hematology, Hematology Research Laboratory, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, 37# Guo Xue Xiang, Chengdu, Sichuan Province, China.']","['S0145-2126(08)00472-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.10.011 [doi]']",20081126,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cyclic administration of high dose glucocorticoids may cause rapid and substantial changes in quality of life (QoL). The maintenance phase of the Dutch ALL-9 protocol consisted of alternating two weeks on and five weeks off dexamethasone (6 mg/m(2)/day). The present study was performed to assess the effect of dexamethasone on QoL during treatment for ALL according to this protocol. METHODS: In a multicentre prospective cohort study, QoL was assessed halfway (T1) and at the end of the two-year treatment (T2). A generic (Child Health Questionnaire) and disease specific (PedsQL cancer version) QoL questionnaire were used to assess QoL in two periods: on and off dexamethasone, respectively. RESULTS: 41 children (56% males) were evaluated, mean age at diagnosis was 5.6 years. The CHQ physical and psychosocial summary scores were significantly lower than population norms. At T1 and T2, overall QoL showed no significant change. However, regarding specific domains (pain, cognitive functioning, emotion/behaviour and physical functioning) QoL decreased over time. QoL was significantly more impaired during periods on dexamethasone. CONCLUSION: Dexamethasone was associated with decreased QoL.

Other cases of FT have been linked to one of two different germline mutations in the myeloproliferative leukaemia virus oncogene gene (MPL), which codes for the thrombopoietin receptor MPL. We studied an Arab family with two siblings with severe thrombocytosis by linkage analysis and obtained evidence for linkage to MPL. Sequencing revealed homozygosity for the novel MPL germline mutation p.Pro106Leu (c.317C > T) in the two siblings. Subsequently, homozygosity for p.Pro106Leu was identified in six further FT patients from three other Arab families. Of 18 heterozygous carriers, 14 had normal platelet counts, while four had mild thrombocytosis. Strong support for association of the novel MPL mutation p.Pro106Leu with development of familial thrombocytosis has been obtained. Overall, p.Pro106Leu was absent on 386 alleles of 193 healthy German controls and present on 14 of 426 alleles (3.3%) of 213 unrelated Arabs, which was statistically significantly different (P < 0.001, Fisher's exact test). We assume that p.Pro106Leu is a frequent MPL mutation in the Arab population, leading to severe thrombocytosis in homozygotes and occasionally to mild thrombocytosis in heterozygotes. In the families described the mode of inheritance could be regarded as autosomal-recessive with possible mild heterozygote manifestation rather than autosomal-dominant with high penetrance as usually seen in FT.","['Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University of Hannover, Hannover, Germany.']","['BJH7430 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07430.x [doi]']",20081119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such 'stereotyped' BCR occur more frequently in CLL with unmutated (UM) than mutated (M) IGHV genes. We analysed 1426 IG rearrangements (from 1398 CLL cases) by a clustering driven by HCDR3 similarities. Molecular findings were correlated to time-to-treatment (TTT) and presence of known prognosticators. Sixty-nine clusters (319 IG-rearrangements, 22.4%) with stereotyped BCR were identified. Among 30 confirmed clusters (>or=3 IG-rearrangements/cluster), we found 14 novel clusters, of which 11 had M IG rearrangements (M clusters) and predominantly (8/11) used IGHV3 subgroup genes. Recurrent cluster-biased amino acid changes were found throughout IGHV sequences of these 'M clusters'. Regarding clinical outcome: (i) UM CLL from the IGHV1-2/1-3/1-18/1-46/7-4-1/IGKV1-39 cluster had poorer prognosis than UM/M cases, or UM cases using the same IGHV genes but not in clusters; (ii) M CLL from the IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 cluster had TTT similar to UM CLL, and shorter than M CLL expressing IGHV3-21 but not in cluster.

However, no highly selective inhibitors of SPHK1 are available for in vitro and in vivo studies, except for the newly discovered 'SK inhibitor' (SKI). The present study showed that, in a panel of myeloid leukaemia cell lines, basal level of SPHK1 correlated with the degree of kinase inhibition by SKI. Exposure to SKI caused variable anti-proliferative, cytotoxic effects in all cell lines. In particular, SKI induced an early, significant inhibition of SPHK1 activity, impaired cell cycle progression and triggered apoptosis in K562 cells. Moreover, SKI acted synergistically with imatinib mesylate (IM) to inhibit cell growth and survival. Finally, the inhibitor affected the clonogenic potential and viability of primary cells from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients, including one harbouring the IM-insensitive Abl kinase domain mutation T315I. Due to the fact that the phenomenon of resistance to IM remains a major issue in the treatment of patients with CML, the identification of alternative targets and new drugs may be of clinical relevance.","['Laboratory of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, San Paolo University Hospital and University of Milan, Milan, Italy.']","['BJH7474 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07474.x [doi]']",20081119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A wealth of information is gathering on the possible role of antigenic stimulation in the natural history of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL). However little is known regarding the repertoire and function of TLR in CLL cells. The TLR family includes 10 different transmembrane proteins devoted to recognize specific pathogen-associated molecular patterns and to alarm immunocompetent cells to trigger an immune response. Here, we studied fresh leukaemic cells for the expression pattern of TLR1 to TLR10, NOD1, NOD2 and SIGIRR (also known as TIR8). CLL cells were found to express several pattern recognition receptors including TLR1, TLR2, TLR6, TLR10, NOD1 and NOD2. The specific TLR expressed by CLL cells were functional. Leukaemic cells, upon stimulation with TLR1/2/6 ligands, such as bacterial lipopeptides, activated the nuclear factor-kappaB signalling pathway, expressed CD86 and CD25 activation molecules, and were protected from spontaneous apoptosis. These findings further support the hypothesis that CLL cells resemble antigen-activated B-cells and suggest a potential role of TLR in modulating CLL cell response in the context of specific antigen recognition.","['Department of Oncology, Unit and Laboratory of Lymphoid Malignancies, Istituto Scientifico San Raffaele and Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']","['BJH7475 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07475.x [doi]']",20081119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since response rates to these agents alone are low, we sought to identify markers associated with responsiveness. In a trial of 20 patients treated with the HDI sodium valproate (VPA) in combination with all trans retinoic acid and theophylline, three patients responded clinically with one complete remission (CR) and two partial remissions. The in vivo response of the CR patient was mirrored by high in vitro sensitivity of their blasts to VPA, indicating that similar factors determine both in vivo and in vitro sensitivity. Microarray analysis of the primary AMLs and a panel of haemato-lymphoid cell lines, with a similar range of VPA sensitivities as the primary leukaemic blasts, identified elevated FOSB-expression as a potential marker of VPA sensitivity. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction confirmed overexpression of FOSB in the CR patient blasts compared to patients failing to achieve CR, and in a subset of a larger panel of AML samples. Overexpression of FOSB in K562 myeloid cells significantly increased in vitro sensitivity to VPA. Thus, we propose that FOSB is a novel, potential marker of VPA sensitivity in AML.","['School of Biosciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.']","['BJH7449 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07449.x [doi]']",20081122,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Megakaryocytic dysfunction can lead to neoplastic disorders, such as acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia, an entity with a 500-fold increased incidence in children with Down syndrome (DS). Down Syndrome Critical Region 1 (DSCR1), a member of the calcipressin family of calcineurin inhibitors, is overexpressed in DS, and destabilization of the calcineurin/Nuclear Factor of Activated T cells (NFAT) pathway by overexpression of DSCR1 has been implicated in some of the pathophysiological features of the disease. The roles of NFAT and DSCR1 in megakaryocyte signalling and gene expression, however, are unknown. In this study, we show that calcineurin and NFAT are components of a calcium-induced signalling cascade in megakaryocytes. NFAT activation in megakaryocytes was induced by fibrillar collagen type I and was completely sensitive to the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A. We established DSCR1 as a calcium-induced NFAT target gene in these cells and show that overexpression of DSCR1 in megakaryocytes strongly inhibits NFAT activation as well as NFAT-dependent expression of the Fas ligand gene (FASLG). These results suggest that DSCR1 acts as an endogenous feedback inhibitor of NFAT signalling in megakaryocytes, and may have implications for megakaryocytic gene expression in DS.","['Department of Medicine I, Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany.']","['BJH7490 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07490.x [doi]']",20081122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that SEMG 1 is a cancer-testis (CT) antigen in CLL. In this study, SEMG 1 was applied as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid system of a testicular cDNA library. Seven clones were isolated and Protamine (Prm) 1 was identified as a novel CT antigen in early CLL. PRM1 transcripts were detected in 11/41 (26.8%) patients. Prm 1 protein was also expressed but heterogeneously within individual patients. Of the 11 patients expressing Prm 1, four expressed Zap 70 protein and seven did not. These results, therefore, indicate that Prm 1 could potentially be a suitable target for the design of tumour vaccine for patients with early CLL, including for those with poor risk CLL. High titres of Prm 1 IgG antibodies could be detected in 20 of these 41 CLL patients but not in any of the 20 healthy donors (P = 0.0001), suggesting the presence of Prm 1-reactive immune responses within the immune repertoire of patients with early CLL. Further work is warranted, especially in approaches to upregulate Prm 1 expression, and to determine the role of Prm 1 as an immunotherapeutic target for early CLL.","['Cancer Research Program, Harrington Regional Medical Center Inc, Amarillo, TX, USA.']","['BJH7502 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07502.x [doi]']",20081122,"['R01 CA088434-11/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA088434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 106283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA106283/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 088434/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2752686,['NIHMS139485'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study explored the expression of CDw131 in 105 de novo cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). The levels of CDw131 expression were used to identify two AML subgroups characterized by low (75/105) and high (30/105) expression of this receptor chain. It was observed that (i) the level of CDw131 expression strictly correlated with the level of CD116 (GM-CSFalpha receptor chain) and CD123 (IL-3Ralpha chain); (ii) AMLs with high CDw131 expression were characterized by low CD34 expression and usually high CD11b, CD14 expression; (iii) AMLs with high CDw131 expression frequently co-expressed receptors for angiogenic growth factors (vascular endothelial growth factor R2, Tie-2); (iv) AMLs with high CDw131 expression were more cycling than those with low CDw131 expression; (v) AMLs with high CDw131 frequently displayed Feline Murine Sarcoma (FMS-related) tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) internal tandem duplication and constitutively activated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription-5 (STAT5). In conclusion, the analysis of the level of CDw131 expression enabled the identification of a subset of AMLs characterized by a high cycling status, the expression of myelo-monocytic markers, mutated FLT3 and the co-expression of receptors for angiogenic growth factors.

This study demonstrated the constitutive activation of NF-kappaB in human myeloid blasts and a clear correlation between NF-kappaB expression and in vitro cytoprotection. High NF-kappaB expression was found in many of the poor prognostic acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) subtypes, such as French-American-British classification M0 and M7, and the poor cytogenetic risk group. The in vitro effects of LC-1, a novel dimethylamino-parthenolide analogue, were assessed in 62 primary untreated AML samples. LC-1 was found to be cytotoxic to AML cells in a dose-dependent manner, mediated through the induction of apoptosis. The median drug concentration necessary to kill 50% of the cells was 4.5 micromol/l for AML cells, compared with 12.8 micromol/l for normal marrow cells. LC-1 was shown to reduce the five individual human NF-kappaB Rel proteins in a dose-dependent manner. The subsequent inhibition of many NF-kappaB-regulated cytokines was also demonstrated. Importantly, sensitivity to LC-1 was correlated with the basal NF-kappaB activity. Consequently, LC-1 treatment provides a proof of principle for the use of NF-kappaB inhibitors in the treatment of AML.","['Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff, UK. jenkins800@hotmail.com']","['BJH7392 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07392.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiangiogenic agents in clinical use target one or more cellular pathways involved in the cascade of vascular growth. In haematological malignancies, angiogenesis occurs within a bone marrow ecosystem comprised of closely apposed malignant cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, endothelial progenitor cells, dendritic cells, and extracellular matrix. Inhibition of angiogenesis therefore blocks not only the delivery of oxygen and micronutrients to cancer cells, but also disrupts the interdependency of these cellular players and the paracrine effects they exert to maintain the malignant phenotype. Agents such as thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib, and bevacizumab, have demonstrated clinical activity in myeloma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and leukaemias. In leukaemia, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is emerging as a compelling biological target for therapy, as well as a potential predictive marker for disease relapse. Initial clinical studies suggest that the anti-VEGF strategies may advance the primary, sequential or adjunctive treatment for leukaemia, and establish the basis for other potential antiangiogenic strategies in haematological malignancies.","['The Angiogenesis Foundation, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA. wli@angio.org']","['BJH7372 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07372.x [doi]']",,,,,,78,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differential diagnosis includes systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), an autoinflammatory syndrome associated with activation of phagocytic cells that, at presentation, is difficult to differentiate from severe systemic infections. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum concentrations of the phagocytic proinflammatory protein S100A12 may help in deciding whether to treat patients with FUO with antibiotics or immunosuppressive agents. METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 45 healthy control subjects and from 240 patients (60 with systemic-onset JIA, 17 with familial Mediterranean fever [FMF], 18 with neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease [NOMID], 17 with Muckle-Wells syndrome [MWS], 40 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL], 5 with acute myeloblastic leukemia [AML], and 83 with systemic infections). All samples were collected at the time of presentation, before the initiation of any treatment, and concentrations of S100A12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The mean +/- 95% confidence interval serum levels of S100A12 were as follows: in patients with JIA, 7,190 +/- 2,690 ng/ml; in patients with FMF, 6,720 +/- 4,960 ng/ml; in patients with NOMID, 720 +/- 450 ng/ml; in patients with MWS, 150 +/- 60 ng/ml; in patients with infections, 470 +/- 160 ng/ml; in patients with ALL, 130 +/- 80 ng/ml; in patients with AML, 45 +/- 60 ng/ml; in healthy control subjects, 50 +/- 10 ng/ml. The sensitivity and specificity of S100A12 to distinguish between systemic-onset JIA and infections were 66% and 94%, respectively. CONCLUSION: S100A12, a marker of granulocyte activation, is highly overexpressed in patients with systemic-onset JIA or FMF, which may point to as-yet unknown common inflammatory mechanisms in these diseases. The measurement of S100A12 serum levels may provide a valuable diagnostic tool in the evaluation of FUO.","['University Hospital Muenster, Muenster, Germany.']",['10.1002/art.24137 [doi]'],,['Z01 AR041138-05/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2680303,['NIHMS58669'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The long terminal repeat (LTR) of this virus, like the LTRs present in FeLV from other cats with AML, differs from the LTRs of other known FeLV in that it has 3 tandem direct 47-bp repeats in the upstream region of the enhancer (URE). Here, we injected cats with FeLV clone33 and found 41% developed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias and dysplastic changes in the bone marrow. Some of the cats with MDS eventually developed AML. The bone marrow of the majority of cats with FeLV clone33 induced MDS produced fewer erythroid and myeloid colonies upon being cultured with erythropoietin or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-SCF) than bone marrow from normal control cats. Furthermore, the bone marrow of some of the cats expressed high-levels of the apoptosis-related genes TNF-alpha and survivin. Analysis of the proviral sequences obtained from 13 cats with naturally occurring MDS reveal they also bear the characteristic URE repeats seen in the LTR of FeLV clone33 and other proviruses from cats with AML. Deletions and mutations within the enhancer elements are frequently observed in naturally occurring MDS as well as AML. These results suggest that FeLV variants that bear URE repeats in their LTR strongly associate with the induction of both MDS and AML in cats.","['Laboratory of Veterinary Internal Medicine II, School of Veterinary Medicine, Azabu University, Sagamihara City, Kanagawa, Japan.']",['10.1002/ijc.24050 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both genetic and environmental factors are likely to be involved. The presence of spatial clustering is indicative of a very localized environmental component to aetiology. Spatial clustering is present when there are a small number of areas with greatly increased incidence or a large number of areas with moderately increased incidence. To determine whether localized environmental factors may play a part in childhood cancer aetiology, we analyzed for spatial clustering using a large set of national population-based data from Great Britain diagnosed 1969-1993. The Potthoff-Whittinghill method was used to test for extra-Poisson variation (EPV). Thirty-two thousand three hundred and twenty-three cases were allocated to 10,444 wards using diagnosis addresses. Analyses showed statistically significant evidence of clustering for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over the whole age range (estimate of EPV = 0.05, p = 0.002) and for ages 1-4 years (estimate of EPV = 0.03, p = 0.015). Soft-tissue sarcoma (estimate of EPV = 0.03, p = 0.04) and Wilms tumours (estimate of EPV = 0.04, p = 0.007) also showed significant clustering. Clustering tended to persist across different time periods for cases of ALL (estimate of between-time period EPV = 0.04, p =0.003). In conclusion, we observed low level spatial clustering that is attributable to a limited number of cases. This suggests that environmental factors, which in some locations display localized clustering, may be important aetiological agents in these diseases. For ALL and soft tissue sarcoma, but not Wilms tumour, common infectious agents may be likely candidates.","['School of Clinical Medical Sciences (Child Health), Sir James Spence Institute, Newcastle University, Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, UK. richard.mcnally@ncl.ac.uk']",['10.1002/ijc.23965 [doi]'],,['Department of Health/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The measurement of cellular cytotoxicity against the syngeneic murine B-cell leukemia line A20 revealed that T-cells without co-culture or after co-culture with iDC exerted a similar cytotoxicity, whereas T-cells co-incubated with viDC showed a significantly diminished lysis of A20 cells (p<0.05).

This somatostatin structural derivative has no GH release inhibitory or antisecretory activity and does not bind to rat pituitary or the cortex, where all the known somatostatin receptor subtypes are expressed. TT-232 had previously been shown to inhibit the proliferation of a large number of cancer cell lines in vitro and reduce the size of different tumors in animal models in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The therapeutic efficacy of TT-232 was evaluated in different long-term administration routes: the traditional injection (i.p. or s.c.) versus infusion treatment via s.c.- or i.v.-inserted Alzet osmotic minipump, and on different types of transplantable rodent (S-180 sarcoma, P-388sc lymphoid leukemia, Colon-26 adenocarcinoma, MXT breast carcinoma, B-16 melanoma) and human tumor models (HT-18 lymphoid melanoma, T-47/D breast carcinoma, A-431 epidermoid carcinoma). On the basis of our previous experiments the optimum injected dose of TT-232 was found to be 15 microg/kg twice a day. This dose is equivalent to 0.6 dg/day by infusion therapy. RESULTS: In our experiments, the best results were achieved when TT-232 was applied as an infused treatment. In the S-180 sarcoma and P-388sc lymphoid leukemia rodent tumor models the infusion treatment with TT-232 resulted in 61%-100% tumor growth inhibition and in 20%-60% of the mice being long-term and tumor-free survivors. In the aggressive Colon-26 adenocarcinoma and MXT breast carcinoma models, the infusion treatment resulted in 52%-75% tumor growth inhibition. In the B-16 melanoma model, the infusion treatments resulted in 47% -63% growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment with TT-232 on HT-18 human lymphoid melanoma tumor proved to be significant, resulting in 69%-79% decreases in tumor volume. In the T-47/D human breast carcinoma, the infusion treatment resulted in 48%-53% tumor growth inhibition. The tumor growth inhibitory effect of infusion treatment on A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma tumor resulted in 70%-74% decreases in tumor volume. CONCLUSION: The antitumor efficacy of TT-232 was seen in almost all the tumors investigated. In our study, the route of infusion was shown to increase drug efficacy relative to conventional delivery methods (injection). The results obtained from this study suggest that TT-232 is a promising new antitumor agent in cancer chemotherapy and a good candidate for delivery by continuous (infusion) therapy.","['National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate if PDGFR mutations are involved in CBFL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to detect PDGFR mutations in CBFL, 35 patients without KIT or FLT3 mutations patients were screened by rapid and sensitive single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Sequence analysis was performed in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products showing altered mobility in SSCP analysis in order to determine the nucleotide changes. RESULTS: Three types of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were detected in the PDGFRA gene (exon 12, exon 13 and exon 18) while no mutation of PDGFRB was detected in the tested CBFLs. CONCLUSION: These data showed that no pathogenic mutations in PDGFRA and PDGFRB were detected in the context of CBFL without KIT and FLT3 mutations. Thus, PDGFR genes do not seem to be involved in CBFL and future studies are needed to establish the genetic causes of the disease in these particular patients.","['Division of Hematology, Niguarda Hospital, Milan, Italy. alessandra.trojani@ospedaleniguarda.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The antiproliferative effects of natural compounds and their interactions with doxorubicin were determined in MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays. Apoptosis-inducing activity was additionally measured by means of dual annexin V and propidium iodide staining. RT-PCR was used to test the expression of Pgp mRNA after acridone treatment. All of the acridones investigated increased the accumulation of Rh-123. Gravacridonetriol and gravacridonediol monomethyl ether increased the antiproliferative effect of doxorubicin on resistant L5178 cells. Treatment with these agents resulted in a decrease in Pgp mRNA levels. Naturally occurring acridone alkaloids exhibit a beneficial combination of anticancer effects and, accordingly, the acridone skeleton can be considered useful in the design of novel antiproliferative agents.","['Department of Pharmacodynamics and Biopharmacy, University of Szeged, Eotvos u. 6, H-6720 Szeged, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Wnt3A stimulation either had no effect on, or slightly suppressed, the short-term growth of these cell lines. In three cell lines, Wnt3A promoted clonogenic cell recovery after suspension culture, suggesting the promotion of the self-renewal capacity of leukemic stem or progenitor cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that Wnt3A stimulation reduced phosphorylated beta-catenin and increased beta-catenin in these cells, indicating that Wnt3A stimulation activated Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

The human myelogenous leukemia cell lines (HL-60, ML-1, KG-1) were the most sensitive to SBA, followed by human oral squamous cell carcinoma (HSC-2, HSC-3, HSC-4) and human glioblastoma (T98G, U87MG). Human oral normal cells (gingival fibroblast, pulp cell, periodontal ligament fibroblast) were the most resistant. In contrast to actinomycin D, SBA induced little or no activation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 in the HSC-2, HSC-4, T98G and HL-60 cells, regardless of incubation time (either 6 or 24 h). SBA induced little or no internucleosomal DNA fragmentation after 6 h in all of these cells. However, prolonged treatment with SBA (24 h) induced a smear pattern of DNA fragmentation in the HSC-2, HSC-4 and T98G cells and a low level of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in the HL-60 cells. Electron microscopy demonstrated the destruction of mitochondrial structure and autophagocytosis of broken organelles by SBA in the HSC-2, HSC-4 and HL-60 cells.

METHODS: cDNAs from 87 leukemia and 199 control blood samples were analyzed for the cSNPs in CDA by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and sequencing. Human CDA genes were transformed into E. coli and yeast, respectively. Catalytic activities of the allele CDA and variant CDAs were determined by HPLC assay. The Ara-C sensitivity of the yeast transformants was measured by growth inhibition assays. RESULTS: Three known different polymorphisms, namely, 79A/C (K27Q), 208G/A (A70T) and 435T/C (silent) were identified in the coding region of CDA from an investigated Chinese population and displayed allelic frequencies of 12.1%, 0.5% and 76.2%, respectively. No association with susceptibility to disease was observed. Compared with that of CDA70A, the deamination activities for cytidine and Ara-C substrates of the E. coli transformants carrying human CDA70T were decreased by 53% and 63%, respectively (P<0.01), and the Ara-C IC50 value of the yeast transformants was also significantly decreased by 25% [(973 +/- 61) micromol/L to (735 +/- 31) micromol/L, P<0.05]. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 known cSNPs and their allelic frequencies of CDA are identified in a Chinese childhood AL.

PROCEDURE: The TPMT biochip was used to detect 6 TPMT single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to 7 TPMT-deficiency alleles (TPMT*2, TPMT*3A, TPMT*3B, TPMT*3C, TPMT*3D, TPMT*7, and TPMT*8). We analyzed allele frequencies in the whole cohort, the childhood cancer group, and the non-cancer group. We also characterized disease features and outcome according to the presence of TPMT SNPs in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). RESULTS: Fifty-five (5.5%) study participants overall had heterozygous TPMT genotypes (1 variant and 1 wild-type allele): TPMT*1/*3A (n = 45; 4.5%), TPMT*1/*3C (n = 8; 0.8%), and TPMT*1/*2 (n = 2; 0.2%). TPMT SNPs were more frequent in children with hematologic malignancy than in other participants (7.5% vs. 4.0%, P = 0.02). We found no significant association between TPMT SNPs and ALL treatment outcome (median follow-up, 31.3 months). CONCLUSIONS: TPMT*3A is the most prevalent variant allele in the Russian Federation. The estimated frequency of variant alleles in the study cohort (5.5%) was similar to that observed in the White populations in the U.S. and Eastern Europe.","['Federal Research Center for Pediatric Hematology, Oncology, and Immunology, Moscow, Russia.']",['10.1002/pbc.21837 [doi]'],,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765-31/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2794198,['NIHMS123733'],,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Data on all eligible childhood leukemia deaths were obtained from the Bureau of Vital Statistics of the Taiwan Provincial Department of Health. The control group consisted of children who died from causes other than neoplasms or diseases that were not associated with respiratory complications. The controls were pair matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. Each matched control was selected randomly from the set of possible controls for each case. Data on the number of petrol stations in study municipalities were collected from the two major petroleum supply companies, Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and Formosa Petrochemical Corporation (FPCC). The petrol station density (per square kilometer) (PSD) for study municipalities was used as an indicator of a subject's exposure to benzene and other hydrocarbons present in evaporative losses of petrol or to air emissions from motor vehicles. The subjects were divided into tertiles according to PSD in their residential municipality. The results showed that there was a significant exposure-response relationship between PSD and the risk of leukemia development in young children after controlling for possible confounders. The findings of this study warrant further investigation of the role of traffic air pollution exposure in the etiology of childhood leukemia.","['College of Health Sciences, Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.']","['906010495 [pii]', '10.1080/15287390802477338 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A retrospective study was conducted over 1995-2006 in patients admitted in 18 Italian hematological divisions. Twenty-four cases of advanced MCD were collected: 12 aggressive SM (50%), 8 mast cell leukemia (33%), 4 SM with associated clonal non-mast cell-lineage hematologic disease (17%). Spleen and liver were the principal extramedullary organ involved. The c-kit point mutation D816V was found in 13/18 patients in which molecular biology studies were performed (72%). Treatments were very heterogeneous: on the whole Imatinib was administered in 17 patients, alpha-Interferon in 8, 2-CdA in 3; 2 patients underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The overall response rate to Imatinib, the most frequently employed drugs, was of 29%, registering one complete remission and four partial remission; all responsive patients did not present D816V c-kit mutation. Overall three patients (12%) died for progression of disease. We conclude that MCD is characterized by severe mediator-related symptoms but with a moderate mortality rate. D816V c-kit mutation is frequent and associated with resistance against Imatinib. Because of the rarity of these forms, an effective standard of care is lacking. More data are needed to find new and successful therapeutic strategies.","['Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, 1, 00168, Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, 1, 00168, Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Largo Francesco Vito, 1, 00168, Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia L. e A.

Infection and hemorrhage are still the major causes of mortality in AML patients. Progress in therapy and supportive care has led to gradual improvement in the overall results, but further improvements are still needed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The aim of this study is to identify the outcome and costs of adult AML patients treated with conventional chemotherapy (CCT) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), Cairo University during the time period from April 1999 to January 2002. Clinical, laboratory characteristics were all recorded. Data regarding different types of therapies given for these patients including response, outcome and costs were also collected. RESULTS: The median age of 82 identified AML patients was 34 years. The complete remission (CR) rate after induction with CCT was 52% (42/82 patients) with a median CR duration of 9 months. Twenty-eight percent of patients who achieved CR subsequently relapsed. By January 2003, fifty-eight patients were dead (70.7%). Infections were the major mortality cause, followed by disease progression then bleeding (65% , 28% and 7% respectively). The median treatment cost per patient was 33158 Egyptian Pounds (LE). It was higher for patients who achieved CR compared to those who relapsed and/or died. Drugs contributed by 78 % to the total treatment cost, while hospitalization, investigations and blood-component therapy contributed by 6%, 7% and 8% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Outcome of patients with AML treated at NCI- Cairo University can be enhanced by improvement of supportive therapy; mainly infection control and expanding BMT programs to accommodate all eligible patients.","['The Department of Medical Oncology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The causes of the majority of pediatric acute leukemia are unknown and are likely to involve an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Therefore, unfavourable gene-environmental interactions might be involved in the genesis of ALL. The aim of this work was to evaluate, in a case-control study, whether the common polymorphisms in 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) namely (C677T and A1298C) and methionine synthase (MS) (A2756G) genes may play a role in altering susceptibility to pediatric ALL as individual genes and in combination. PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA of 88 ALL patients (age < or = 18 years) and 311 healthy control subjects was analyzed for the polymorphisms of MTHFR and MS genes using PCR-RFLP method. RESULTS: The frequencies of the wild types of MTHFR 677CC, MTHFR 1298AA and MS 2756AA, the homozygous genotypes of MTHFR 677TT, MTHFR 1298CC and MS 2756GG and heterozygous genotypes of MTHFR 677CT and MS 2756AG showed no statistically significant differences between patients and controls. The frequency of the MTHFR 1298AC heterozygous genotype was 25% among patients compared to 45.0% among controls; the difference was found to be statistically significant (p value =0.001, O.R=0.382 & 95% C.I=0.222-0.658). The frequency of the MTHFR1298AC heterozygous genotype plus 1298CC homozygous genotype was 34% among patients compared to 54.3% among controls and the difference was statistically significant (p value =0.001). A synergistic effect of 677CT and1298AC (CTAC) was observed, (p value=0.002) with 3.65 fold protection (OR 0.273 & 95% C.I=0.155-0.9) compared to 2.6 folds for MTHFR 1298AC alone. This protective effect of CTAC polymorphism was abolished when combined with MS 2756AA or AG. CONCLUSION: The present study provided further evidence for the protective role of MTHFR 1298AC mutant alleles in acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children (2.6 fold protection). This suggests that folate and methionine metabolism play an important role in the pathogenesis of pediatric ALL. In contrast to the main bulk of literature, we did not find any protective role of either MTHFR C677T or MS A2756G polymorphisms. This may reflect the ethnic variation in both the polymorphism frequencies, variation in plasma level of folate, in addition to the possible role of gene-environment interaction mainly dietary availability of folate. The synergistic effect of MTHFR 1298AC and 677CT and its abolishment by MS 2756AA or AG further emphasizes that the interaction of genes, rather than the polymorphism in any single one, determines risk susceptibility to disease.","['The Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. azzamkamel@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cytogenetic and immunophenotypic analysis were done for all patients. Patients received ALL-PNCI-III/98 chemotherapy protocol used at NCI, Cairo University. RESULTS: The frequency of pseudodiploidy and normal karyotype in the whole group was 42.9% and 33.3% respectively. The frequency of pseudodiploidy was 36.8% in CALLA positive early pre B, 30.7% in pre B cases, 71.4% in T cell cases and 100% in mature B cell cases. At 12 months, DFS was 50% for pseudodiploid group having pre B phenotype, compared to 16.6% for pseudodiploid group with CALLA positive early pre B ALL. Sixteen percent of the studied cases showed T cell phenotype, 71.4% of them showed pseudodiploid karyotype, all of them had high risk features. Hyperdiploidy was found in 31.5% of CALLA positive early pre B cases and was associated with favorable prognostic features and DFS of 66.6% at 12 months. Hyperdiploidy of >50 chromosome represented 62.5% of hyperdipoid cases, 80% of them were CALLA positive early pre B ALL carrying good risk features. Fifty percent of normal karyotypic patients showed pre B phenotype, while 42.8% showed CALLA positive early pre B ALL. Their age, TLC, DFS, were almost comparable. CONCLUSION: CALLA early pre B phenotype has a positive impact on chromosomal pattern having best outcome among patients with hyperdiploidy. The Pseudodiploid karyotype carries a better outcome with pre B phenotype.","['The Department of Clinical Pathology, National Cancer Institute, Cairo University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variations in open trials, trial age eligibility criteria and extent of trial activation in treatment centres in part explain this observation. Other possible influences, such as difficulties associated with the consent of TYA require further evaluation.

Moreover, mediating mechanisms underlying the alleged cancer-promoting effects of blood transfusion are unknown, including the involvement of donors' leukocytes, erythrocytes, and soluble factors. METHOD: Two syngeneic tumor models were used in Fischer 344 rats, the MADB106 mammary adenocarcinoma and the CRNK-16 leukemia. Outcomes included host ability to clear circulating cancer cells, and host survival rates. The independent impact of blood transfusion was assessed, and potential deleterious characteristics of the transfusion were studied, including blood storage duration; the role of erythrocytes, leukocyte, and soluble factors; and the kinetics of the effects. RESULTS: Blood transfusion was found to be an independent and significant risk factor for cancer progression in both models, causing up to a fourfold increase in lung tumor retention and doubling mortality rates. Blood storage time was the critical determinant of these deleterious effects, regardless of whether the transfused blood was allogeneic or autogenic. Surprisingly, aged erythrocytes (9 days and older), rather than leukocytes or soluble factors, mediated the effects, which occurred in both operated and nonoperated animals. The effects of erythrocytes transfusion in the MADB106 model emerged immediately and dissipated within 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: In rats, transfusion of fresh blood is less harmful than transfusion of stored blood in the context of progressing malignancies. Further studies should address mediating mechanisms through which erythrocytes' storage duration can impact the rate of complications while treating malignant diseases and potentially other pathologies.","['Neuroimmunology Research Unit, Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, Israel.']","['10.1097/ALN.0b013e31818ddb72 [doi]', '00000542-200812000-00012 [pii]']",,"['R01 CA125456-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073056-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA125456/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073056-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2694914,['NIHMS108530'],"['Anesthesiology. 2008 Dec;109(6):951-3.

To spare donor T-cell-mediated graft-versus-leukemia immunity against hematopoiesis-restricted minor histocompatibility (minor-H) antigens, we explored the use of patient-derived nonhematopoietic antigen-presenting cells (APC) as allogeneic stimulators for selective allodepletion in leukemia-reactive donor T-cell lines. METHODS: Primary keratinocytes, dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow fibroblasts were generated from skin biopsies and diagnostic bone marrow aspirates of acute myeloid leukemia patients in vitro. Cell cultures were analyzed for expansion, phenotype, and immunostimulatory capacity in comparison with CD40-activated B cells as professional APC. In addition, nonhematopoietic APCs were used for selective allodepletion in vitro. RESULTS: Patient-derived fibroblasts could be reliably expanded to large cell numbers, whereas keratinocytes had limited growth potential. Interferon-gamma-pretreated fibroblasts showed increased expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-class I and II molecules, CD40, and CD54. Fibroblasts and CD40-activated B cells comparably stimulated HLA-A*0301-specific CD8 T cells after transient expression of HLA-A*0301 as a model alloantigen. Finally, fibroblasts could be effectively applied to selectively deplete alloreactivity within leukemia-reactive donor CD8 T-cell lines by targeting the activation-induced antigen CD137. CONCLUSIONS: Primary fibroblasts can be efficiently used as allogeneic nonhematopoietic APC for selective depletion of donor T cells reactive to HLA and ubiquitously expressed minor-H antigen disparities in leukemia-stimulated CD8 T-cell lines. Therefore, harnessing alloreactivity to hematopoietic minor-H antigens in addition to leukemia-associated antigens might increase graft-versus-leukemia immunity of donor lymphocyte grafts in allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.","['Department of Medicine III - Hematology and Oncology, Johannes Gutenberg-University Medical School, Mainz, Germany.']","['10.1097/TP.0b013e31818810d6 [doi]', '00007890-200811270-00016 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because lower cAMP levels may contribute to the decreased apoptosis that occurs in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we assessed the expression levels of PDE isoforms in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of healthy adults and patients with CLL. We found a unique PDE mRNA signature in CLL: higher levels than in normal PBMC of PDE7B (increased approximately 23-fold) and lower levels of PDE3B, 4D, 5A, and 9A mRNA (each decreased approximately 30-fold). Increased PDE7B mRNA in CLL correlates with a 10-fold-higher expression of PDE7B protein and results in an increased contribution of PDE7 to total PDE activity. Consistent with the higher level of PDE7B expression, inhibitors of PDE7 (BRL-50481, IR-202) and a dual PDE4/PDE7 inhibitor (IR-284) selectively increase apoptosis in CLL cells compared with normal PBMC or B cells. Apoptosis of CLL cells promoted by inhibitors of PDE7 and PDE4/7 is attenuated by PKA inhibition, occurs via a mitochondrial-dependent process, and is associated with increased cAMP accumulation and down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin and of PDE7B.

Other factors might thus importantly contribute in increasing infection by HTLV-I. Galectin-1 is a galactoside-binding lectin which is secreted by activated T lymphocytes. Several functions have been attributed to this protein including its capacity to increase cell-to-cell adhesion. Based on previous studies, we postulated that this protein could also accentuate HTLV-I infection. RESULTS: Herein, we demonstrate that galectin-1 expression and release are higher in HTLV-I-infected T cells in comparison to uninfected T cells. Furthermore, galectin-1 expression was activated in various cell lines expressing the wild type viral Tax protein while this induction was minimal upon expression of NF-kappaB activation-defective TaxM22. Cotransfection of these Tax expression vectors with galectin-1 promoter-driven luciferase constructs confirmed that Tax upregulated galectin-1 promoter activity. However, a NF-kappaB-independent mechanism was strongly favoured in this induction of galectin-1 expression as no activation of the promoter was apparent in Jurkat cells treated with known NF-kappaB activators. Using HTLV-I envelope pseudotyped HIV-1 virions, galectin-1 was shown to increase infectivity. In addition, a co-culture assay with HTLV-I-infected cells also indicated an increase in cell fusion upon addition of galectin-1. This effect was not mediated by factors present in the supernatant of the HTLV-I-infected cells. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that HTLV-I Tax increases galectin-1 expression and that this modulation could play an important role in HTLV-I infection by stabilizing both cell-to-cell and virus-cell interactions.","['Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Departement des sciences biologiques, 2080 St-Urbain, Montreal, Quebec, H2X 3X8, Canada. sonia.gauthier@crchul.ulaval.ca']","['1742-4690-5-105 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-105 [doi]']",20081125,,PMC2613925,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A potential cause of differences seen in these strains may be based on the fact that some strains have a high concentration of infectious murine leukemia virus (MuLV) in the brain, whereas other strains have little or no virus. To elucidate the effect of a higher titer of endogenous retrovirus in astroglial cells of the brain, we established astroglial cell lines from SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice, which are, respectively, resistant and prone to deficit in learning and memory and shortened life span. MuLV-negative astroglial cell lines established from ICR mice served as controls. Comparison of these cell lines showed differences in: 1) levels of the capsid antigen CAgag in both cell lysates and culture media, 2) expression of genomic retroelements, 3) the number of virus particles, 4) titer of infectious virus, 5) morphology, 6) replication rate of cells in culture and final cell concentrations, 7) expression pattern of proinflammatory cytokine genes. The results show that the expression of MuLV is much higher in SAMP8 than SAMR1 astrocyte cultures and that there are physiological differences in astroglia from the 2 strains. These results raise the possibility that the distinct physiological differences between SAMP8 and SAMR1 are a function of activation of endogenous retrovirus.","['Ilsong Institute of Life Science, Hallym University, 1605-4 Gwanyang-dong Dongan-gu, Anyang, Gyeonggi-do 431-060, South Korea. bhkim@hallym.ac.kr']","['1742-4690-5-104 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-104 [doi]']",20081125,,PMC2607306,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increasing emergence and spread of drug-resistant TB poses a significant threat to disease control and calls for the urgent development of new drugs. The tryptophan biosynthetic pathway plays an important role in the survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Thus, indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase (IGPS), as an essential enzyme in this pathway, might be a potential target for anti-TB drug design. In this study, we deduced the structure of IGPS of M. tuberculosis H37Rv by using homology modeling. On the basis of this deduced IGPS structure, screening was performed in a search for novel inhibitors, using the Maybridge database containing the structures of 60,000 compounds. ATB107 was identified as a potential binding molecule; it was tested, and shown to have antimycobacterial activity in vitro not only against the laboratory strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv, but also against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant TB strains. Most MDR-TB strains tested were susceptible to 1 microg x mL(-1) ATB107. ATB107 had little toxicity against THP-1 macrophage cells, which are human monocytic leukemia cells. ATB107, which bound tightly to IGPS in vitro, was found to be a potent competitive inhibitor of the substrate 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate, as shown by an increased K(m) value in the presence of ATB107. The results of site-directed mutagenesis studies indicate that ATB107 might inhibit IGPS activity by reducing the binding affinity for substrate of residues Glu168 and Asn189. These results suggest that ATB107 is a novel potent inhibitor of IGPS, and that IGPS might be a potential target for the development of new anti-TB drugs. Further evaluation of ATB107 in animal studies is warranted.","['State Key Laboratory of Genetic Engineering, School of Life Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.']","['EJB6763 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1742-4658.2008.06763.x [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this retrospective analysis was to evaluate any age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic differences in pediatric patients who received BU as a conditioning agent.

Sixteen patients received BU + cyclophosphamide while five patients received BU + another agent. There were 20 allogeneic and one autologous transplants among which 16 were human leukocyte antigen matched and five were mismatched. Average BU clearance in patients younger than four yr old (n = 8) was 4.1 +/- 1.0 mL/min/kg vs. 3.1 +/- 0.7 mL/min/kg in patients older than four yr old (n = 13) (p = 0.02).

METHODS: ATRA, okadaic acid (OKA) and ATRA + OKA at the same dosage were incubated with NB4 and MR2 cells respectively. Wright's staining and NBT reduction test were employed to evaluate the change in the cells. The CD11b expression was measured by flow cytometry. The activity of PP2A was evaluated by serine/threonine phosphatase assay system, and the level of PP2A subunits was detected by Western blot. RESULTS: 1) Wright's staining, NBT reduction test and flow cytometry results showed OKA could augment the differentiation of NB4 induced by ATRA, and OKA + ATRA induced slight differentiation of MR2 cells. 2) Phosphatase assay showed a decrease in PP2A phosphatase activity [(534 +/- 43) pmol x min(-1) x microg protein(-1)] in NB4 after ATRA treatment, accompanied with that activity [(959 +/- 83) pmol x min(-1) x microg protein(-1)] in untreated NB4 cells. OKA enhanced the inhibitory effect of ATRA on the activity in NB4. When OKA + ATRA was incubated with MR2, PP2A in the cells was significantly decreased [(229 +/- 23) pmol x min(-1) x microg protein(-1)]. 3) Western blot analysis showed that the level of PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A/C) was decreased during the course of ATRA-induced NB4 cell differentiation, whereas expressions of every subunits of PP2A in MR2 cells were somewhat unaltered. CONCLUSION: Expression of PP2A/C and activity of PP2A is decreased during differentiation of NB4 induced by ATRA, and no repression of the PP2 activity maybe related to MR2 resistance to ATRA.","['Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Drum Tower hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing 210008, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunohistochemical study for zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70 kDa (ZAP70), p53 and interferon regulation factor 4 (IRF-4) was also performed. RESULTS: Samples of 18 cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL)/ diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL,78. 3%) had identical tumor cell clones, whereas DLBCL developed as a clonally independent neoplasm in 5 patients (21.7%). Among the clonally related group, 12 cases carried unmutated VH genes in both B-CLL and DLBCL components and VH3-23, VH3-74 and VH1-2 were accounted for the B-CLL transformation to DLBCL. Immunohistochemical study showed that the transformed DLBCL expressed CD5 in 32.1% of cases, CD23 in 14.3%, ZAP70 in 23.8%, p53 in 80.6% and IRF-4 in 82.6% of the cases respectively.

No significant difference in survival rate was obtained between the clonally related or unrelated groups, between IgVH gene mutated or unmutated groups, and between the groups with or without expression of ZAP70, p53 and IRF-4. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of clonally related transformed DLBCL from B-CLL to clonally unrelated DLBCL is 2:1. Clonal transformation to DLBCL predominantly occurs in B-CLL patients carrying unmutated IgVH genes. The biased IgVH gene usage suggests antigens are involved in classic Richter's syndrome. Molecular differences of IgVH genes and very poor clinical outcome of this group of transformed DLBCL indicate that there cases may be regarded as a distinct subset of DLBCL.","['Department of Pathology and Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China. maozr@zju.edu.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukaemic blasts harbour several ways to escape the immune system including deficient MHC class II expression, low levels of co-stimulatory molecules and suppressive cytokines. Therapeutic vaccination with dendritic cells (DC) is now recognized as an important investigational therapy. Due to their unique antigen presenting capacity, immunosuppressive features of the leukaemic blasts can be circumvented. DC can be successfully cultured from leukaemic blasts in 60-70% of patients and show functional potential in vivo. Alternatively, monocyte derived DC obtained at time of complete remission loaded with leukaemia-specific antigens can be used as vaccine. Several sources of leukaemia-associated antigen and different methods of loading antigen onto DC have been used in an attempt to optimize antitumour responses including apoptotic cells, necrotic cell lysates and tumour-associated pep-tides. Currently, the AML-derived cell line MUTZ-3, an immortalized equivalent of CD34(+) DC precursor cells, is under investigation for vaccination purposes. For effective DC vaccination the intrinsic tolerant state of the patient must be overcome. Therefore, the development of efficient and safe adjuvants in antigen specific immunotherapeutic programs should be encouraged.","['Department of Haematology, VU-Institute of Cancer and Immunology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, De Boelelaan 1117, 1081 HV, The Netherlands.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed multiple hepatic nodular lesions in the liver. Tru-cut biopsy of the lesions was reported as well-differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient received sandostatin treatment. After a few days, the patient was hospitalized in the intensive care unit with disturbance of consciousness and clinical features suggestive of encephalopathy. Serum ammonia level was found highly elevated. After the treatment with L-ornithine-L-aspartate, a remarkable improvement in the level of patient's sensorium occurred as well as a reduction in serum ammonia level within a few days. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) was performed one week later. The patient's condition began to worsen along with increase in serum ammonia level and he died because of hyperammonemic encephalopathy. There are case reports of hyperammonemia with some malignancies such as multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukemia, and leiomyosarcoma, or in some patients who have received chemotherapy.

Since the incidence of severe GVHD after cord blood transplantation (CBT) is lower than that after transplants using bone marrow or mobilized peripheral blood grafts from adult cells, we should expect better outcomes from CBT in older patients. To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of myeloablative unrelated CBT in patients aged between 50 and 55 years, we performed a retrospective comparison of 100 patients with acute leukemia who received cord blood grafts at our institution. Nineteen older patients (median age, 52; range, 50-55) and 81 younger patients (median, 36; range, 16-49) received a myeloablative conditioning regimen including 12 Gy of total body irradiation and chemotherapy. GVHD prophylaxis included cyclosporine with (n = 96) or without (n = 4) methotrexate. There were no significant differences in the incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD, extensive-type chronic GVHD, TRM, and the probability of overall and disease-free survival between these groups. These results suggest that, in patients with acute leukemia, myeloablative CBT might be as safe and effective in patients aged between 50 and 55 years as in younger patients.","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0641-2 [doi]'],20081122,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has not been established whether chemotherapy should be delayed in patients with spontaneous TLS, and several studies have shown poor prognoses in this group. This retrospective study evaluated the efficacy and safety of continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) with prephase chemotherapy using the modified LMB-89 regimen in patients with Burkitt lymphoma and leukemia (BL/L) at a high risk of developing TLS from February 1998 to February 2007. The chemotherapy regimen was followed by the modified LMB-89 protocol. CVVH was applied to all patients before prephase chemotherapy or within 2 h of chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 19.7 months (range 1-97.8). Eight patients had Burkitt lymphoma and three had Burkitt leukemia; their median age was 48 years. The international prognostic indices were >3 for all patients. Seven patients had spontaneous TLS and four patients were at a high risk of TLS. CVVH was continued for 109 h (range 70.5-157.5). No patient had fatal metabolic complications related to TLS. Renal function had recovered fully before induction chemotherapy in all but one patient. The 1-year event-free survival and overall survival rates were both 82%.

Here we show that retinoic acid also triggers growth arrest of leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) ex vivo and their clearance in PML-RARA mouse APL in vivo. Retinoic acid treatment of mouse APLs expressing the fusion protein PLZF-RARA triggers full differentiation, but not LIC loss or disease remission, establishing that differentiation and LIC loss can be uncoupled. Although retinoic acid and arsenic synergize to clear LICs through cooperative PML-RARA degradation, this combination does not enhance differentiation. A cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent phosphorylation site in PML-RARA is crucial for retinoic acid-induced PML-RARA degradation and LIC clearance. Moreover, activation of cAMP signaling enhances LIC loss by retinoic acid, identifying cAMP as another potential APL therapy. Thus, whereas transcriptional activation of PML-RARA is likely to control differentiation, its catabolism triggers LIC eradication and long-term remission of mouse APL. Therapy-triggered degradation of oncoproteins could be a general strategy to eradicate cancer stem cells.","['Universite de Paris 7/CNRS UMR 7151, Equipe labellisee N degrees 11 Ligue Nationale Contre le Cancer, Service de Biochimie, Hopital St Louis, Paris Cedex 10, France.']","['nm.1891 [pii]', '10.1038/nm.1891 [doi]']",20081123,,,,['Cancer Cell. 2009 Jan 6;15(1):7-8.

Supporting this idea, results with several different human tumor viruses indicate that their oncogenic potential depends in part on a common ability to inactivate key cell polarity proteins. For example, adenovirus (Ad) type 9 is unique among human Ads by causing exclusively estrogen-dependent mammary tumors in experimental animals and in having E4 region-encoded open reading frame 1 (E4-ORF1) as its primary oncogenic determinant. The 125-residue E4-ORF1 protein consists of two separate protein-interaction elements, one of which defines a PDZ domain-binding motif (PBM) required for E4-ORF1 to induce both cellular transformation in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo. Most notably, the E4-ORF1 PBM mediates interactions with a selected group of cellular PDZ proteins, three of which include the cell polarity proteins Dlg1, PATJ and ZO-2. Data further indicate that these interactions promote disruption of cell junctions and a loss of cell polarity. In addition, one or more of the E4-ORF1-interacting cell polarity proteins, as well as the cell polarity protein Scribble, are common targets for the high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 or human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax oncoproteins. Underscoring the significance of these observations, in humans, high-risk HPV and HTLV-1 are causative agents for cervical cancer and adult T-cell leukemia, respectively. Consequently, human tumor viruses should serve as powerful tools for deciphering mechanisms whereby disruption of cell junctions and loss of cell polarity contribute to the development of many human cancers. This review article discusses evidence supporting this hypothesis, with an emphasis on the human Ad E4-ORF1 oncoprotein.","['Department of Molecular Virology and Microbiology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA. rjavier@bcm.edu']","['onc2008352 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.352 [doi]']",,['R01 CA058541/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC3501650,['NIHMS411909'],,233,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We review the literature on lymphocyte polarity and the growing recognition that polarity proteins have an important function in lymphocyte function. We then describe molecular relationships between the polarity network and signaling pathways that have been implicated in leukemogenesis, which suggest mechanisms by which the polarity network might impact on leukemogenesis. We particularly focus on the possibility that disruption of polarity might alter asymmetric cell division (ACD), and that this might be a leukemia-initiating event. We also explore the converse possibility that leukemic stem cells might be produced or maintained by ACD, and therefore that Dlg, Scribble and Lgl might be important regulators of this process.","['Immune Signalling Laboratory, Cancer Immunology, Research Division, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']","['onc2008350 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2008.350 [doi]']",,,,,,141,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, an HIV-1 Tat derived peptide has successfully delivered a large variety of ""cargoes"" including proteins, peptides and nucleic acids into cells when conjugate to the PTD. There also exists other naturally occurring membrane permeable peptides which have potential as PTDs. Specifically, one of the accessory proteins of HIV (viral protein R; i.e., Vpr), which is important in controlling viral pathogenesis, possesses cell transduction domain characteristics. Related to these characteristics, Vpr has also been demonstrated to induce cell cycle arrest and host/target cell apoptosis, suggesting a potential anti-cancer activity for this protein. In this report we assessed the ability of Vpr protein or peptides, with or without conjugation to a PTD, to mediate anti-cancer activity against several tumor cell lines. Specifically, several Vpr peptides spanning carboxy amino acids 65-83 induced significant (i.e., greater than 50%) in vitro growth inhibition/toxicity of murine B16.F10 melanoma cells. Likewise, in in vitro experiments with other tumor cell lines, conjugation of Vpr to the Tat derived PTD and transfection of this construct into cells enhanced the induction of in vitro apoptosis by this protein when compared to the effects of transfection of cells with unconjugated Vpr. These results underscore the potential for Vpr based reagents as well as PTDs to enhance anti-tumor activity, and warrants further examination of Vpr protein and derived peptides as potential therapeutic agents against progressive cell proliferative diseases such as cancer.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA.']","['7205 [pii]', '10.4161/cbt.8.2.7205 [doi]']",20090222,,,,['Cancer Biol Ther. 2009 Jan;8(2):188-91.

Allogeneic lymphocytes produce a strong graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, but the beneficial effect is limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Depletion of T cells abrogates GVHD and GVL effects. Delayed transfusion of donor lymphocytes into chimeras after T cell-depleted stem cell transplantation produces a GVL effect without necessarily producing GVHD. Chimerism and tolerance provide a platform for immunotherapy using donor lymphocytes. The allogeneic GVL effects vary from one disease to another, the stage of the disease, donor histocompatibility, the degree of chimerism, and additional treatment. Immunosuppressive therapy before donor lymphocyte transfusions may augment the effect as well as concomitant cytokine treatment. Possible target antigens are histocompatibility antigens and tumor-associated antigens. Immune escape of tumor cells and changes in the reactivity of T cells are to be considered. Durable responses may be the result of the elimination of leukemia stem cells or the establishment of a durable immune control on their progeny.

The mechanism of leukemic transformation by these fusions has been the subject of numerous investigations. However, the dependence of acute leukemia on MLL fusion activity in vivo and the efficacy of targeting this activity to eliminate disease have not been established. We have developed a model for conditional expression of MLL-ENL in hematopoietic progenitor cells, in which expression of the fusion oncogene is turned off by doxycycline. Conditionally immortalized myeloblast cells derived from these progenitors were found to induce leukemia in vivo. Leukemic cells isolated from primary recipient mice were shown to have acquired additional genetic abnormalities and, when transplanted into secondary recipients, induced leukemia with shortened latencies. However, the leukemic cells remained dependent on MLL-ENL expression in vitro and in vivo, and its ablation resulted in regression of established leukemias. This study demonstrates that even genetically complex leukemias can be reversed on inactivation of the initiating MLL fusion and has important implications for the design of novel leukemia therapies.","['University College London Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital, United Kingdom.']","['S0006-4971(20)39144-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-170480 [doi]']",20081124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would suggest that FLT3 is an ideal therapeutic target, but FLT3 targeted therapy has produced only modest benefits in clinical trials. Due to technical obstacles, the assessment of target inhibition in patients treated with FLT3 inhibitors has been limited and generally only qualitative. KW-2449 is a novel multitargeted kinase inhibitor that induces cytotoxicity in Molm14 cells (which harbor an FLT3/ITD mutation). The cytotoxic effect occurs primarily at concentrations sufficient to inhibit FLT3 autophosphorylation to less than 20% of its baseline. We report here correlative data from a phase 1 trial of KW-2449, a trial in which typical transient reductions in the peripheral blast counts were observed. Using quantitative measurement of FLT3 inhibition over time in these patients, we confirmed that FLT3 was inhibited, but only transiently to less than 20% of baseline. Our results suggest that the failure to fully inhibit FLT3 in sustained fashion may be an underlying reason for the minimal success of FLT3 inhibitors to date, and stress the importance of confirming in vivo target inhibition when taking a targeted agent into the clinical setting.","['Department of Oncology, Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)39274-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-177030 [doi]']",20081124,"['R01 CA090668/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA128864-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2673122,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00346632'],,,,,,,

However, the concentration of MBL in the blood is extremely variable. MBL in subjects with lymphocytosis require treatment at a rate of 1.1% per year and present immunoglobulin (IG) gene features and similar to good prognosis CLL. Little is known about low-count MBL cases, accidentally found in the general population. We analyzed IGHV-D-J rearrangements in 51 CLL-like MBL cases from healthy individuals, characterized by few clonal B cells. Seventy percent of the IGHV genes were mutated. The most frequent IGHV gene was IGHV4-59/61, rarely used in CLL, whereas the IGHV1-69 gene was lacking and the IGHV4-34 gene was infrequent. Only 2 of 51 (3.9%) MBL cases expressed a CLL-specific stereotyped HCDR3. Therefore, the IG gene repertoire in low-count MBL differs from both mutated and unmutated CLL, suggesting that the detection of MBL in an otherwise healthy subject is not always equivalent to a preleukemic state. Detailed IG analysis of individual MBL may help to identify cases that necessitate continuous clinical monitoring to anticipate disease progression.","['Department of Oncology, Universita Vita-Salute San Raffaele, Milano, Italy.']","['S0006-4971(20)37132-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-176933 [doi]']",20081124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanism by which benzene damages hematopoietic cells is unclear; in particular, benzene-induced aberrant gene expression has not been addressed. We analyzed differential gene expression in the peripheral white blood cells from seven female patients with occupational benzene poisoning and seven matched control subjects. In this study, we report altered expression of cytochrome P450 in the patients. All patients exhibited elevated expression of CYP4F3A encoding the leukotriene B4 (LTB(4)) omega-hydroxylase critical in the inactivation of LTB(4) in polymorphonuclear leukocytes with a -fold induction between 3 and 71. Four patients had high expression of CYP1A1, and two patients had elevated expression of CYP1B1. Expressions of CYP2B6, CYP51, and CYP27A1 were also altered in certain patients. Mechanistic analysis revealed that phenol, a major metabolite of benzene, significantly induced the expression of CYP4F3A at both mRNA and protein levels in cultured promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60), similarly to all-trans retinoic acid. Induction of CYP4F3 by phenol was also observed in differentiated HL-60 cells, in the proerythroid cell line K562, and ex vivo in human neutrophils. On the other hand, hydroquinone induced extensive apoptosis of the cells. The findings demonstrated, for the first time, that benzene and metabolites induce CYP4F3 in human blood cells both in vivo and in vitro. Induction of CYP4F3 may play a role in the development of benzene hematotoxicity and serve as a biomarker of benzene exposure.","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']","['dmd.108.023192 [pii]', '10.1124/dmd.108.023192 [doi]']",20081124,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A master regulator of Rb and p53 is the INK4-ARF (CDKN2A/B) locus that encodes two CDK inhibitors, p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B), that maintain Rb in its active, hypophosphorylated form, and p14(ARF) (p19(Arf) in mice), that inhibits Mdm2 and activates p53. The INK4-ARF genes are epigenetically silenced in hematopoietic stem cells but become poised to respond to oncogenic stress as blood cells differentiate. Inactivation of INK4-ARF endows differentiated cells with an inappropriate self-renewal capacity, a defining feature of cancer cells. In BCR-ABL-induced (Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph(+)]) leukemias, INK4-ARF deletions frequently occur in clinically aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemias (Ph(+) ALLs) but are not seen in more indolent Ph(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or in CML myeloid blast crisis. Mouse modeling of Ph(+) ALL reveals that Arf inactivation attenuates responsiveness to targeted BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors, enhances the maintenance of leukemia-initiating cells within the hematopoietic microenvironment, and facilitates the emergence of malignant clones that harbor drug-resistant BCR-ABL kinase mutations. Thus, although BCR-ABL mutations typify drug resistance in both CML and Ph(+) ALL, loss of INK4-ARF in Ph(+) ALL enhances disease aggressiveness and undermines the salutary effects of targeted therapy.","[""Departments of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]","['sqb.2008.73.039 [pii]', '10.1101/sqb.2008.73.039 [doi]']",20081121,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Second malignant neoplasms, however, represent a serious complication after treatment. Depending on dosage, 2-12% of patients treated with topoisomerase II inhibitors and/or alkylating agents develop treatment-related acute myeloid leukaemia characterized by translocations at 11q23. Our goal was to study MLL rearrangements in peripheral lymphocytes using cytogenetic and molecular methods in order to evaluate the late effects of cancer therapy in patients previously treated for childhood ALL. Chromosomal rearrangements at 11q23 were analysed in cytogenetic preparations from 49 long-term ALL survivors and 49 control individuals. Patients were subdivided depending on the inclusion or omission of topoisomerase II inhibitors (VP-16 and/or VM-26) in their treatment protocol. The statistical analysis showed significant (P = 0.007) differences between the frequency of translocations observed for the groups of patients and controls. These differences were also significant (P = 0.006) when the groups of patients (independent of the inclusion of topoisomerase II inhibitors) and controls were compared (P = 0.006). The frequencies of extra signals, however, did not differ between groups of patients and controls. Several MLL translocations were detected and identified by inverse polymerase chain reaction, followed by cloning and sequencing. Thirty-five patients (81%) presented putative translocations; among those, 91% corresponded with t(4;11) (q21;q23), while the other 9% corresponded with t(11;X), t(8;11)(q23;q23) and t(11;16). Our results indicate an increase in MLL aberrations in childhood ALL survivors years after completion of therapy. The higher frequency in this cohort might be associated with therapy using anti-tumoural drugs, independent of the inclusion of topoisomerase II inhibitors. Even though the biological significance of these rearrangements needs further investigation, they demonstrate a degree of genome instability, indicating the relevance of cytogenetic and molecular studies during the follow-up of patients in complete clinical remission.","['Departamento de Genetica, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto-USP, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil. marsol@rge.fmrp.usp.br']","['gen063 [pii]', '10.1093/mutage/gen063 [doi]']",20081121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which cells acquire an enhanced antiapoptosis capacity in the drug-resistant process needs to be further understood. Here, we identified human brain expressed X-linked 1 (hBex1) as a downstream target of the p75 neurotrophin receptor pathway in imatinib-resistant K562 cells by comparing the gene expression profiles with the parent K562 cells. Silencing hBex1 inhibited imatinib-induced cell apoptosis and overexpression of hBex1-sensitized cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis. Further investigation revealed that hBex1 associates with protocadherin 10 (PCDH10). Silencing of pcdh10 attenuated apoptosis induced by imatinib in hBex1 transfected cells, suggesting that, in addition to Mdr and Bcl-2 family members, reduced expression of hBex1 can also inhibit imatinib-induced apoptosis. These data provide evidence that expression of hBex1 in leukemic cells is a novel mechanism by which chemoresistance is achieved and suggests that hBex1 is a potential molecular target for the development of novel leukemia treatments.","['Cancer Institute, Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, PR China.']","['bgn251 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgn251 [doi]']",20081121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cells that had been fixed with methanol, however, nuclear dots of the M1 protein were clearly visible. The dots were evident at 8h post-inoculation. Up to 6h post-inoculation, only a diffuse distribution of the M1 protein was observed. The dots were co-localized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, a major component of nuclear domain 10 (ND10), also called PML oncogenic domains (PODs) or PML-nuclear bodies (NBs).

In the present review, the importance of an accurate cytogenetic diagnosis in del(5q) MDS, its impact on prognosis, and the effect it can have on the choice of treatment was discussed. In addition, the strengths and limitations of conventional and novel cytogenetic testing techniques currently available for patients with del(5q) MDS were evaluated. A practical diagnostic algorithm was provided to help facilitate the early detection and optimal treatment of MDS patients with a del(5q) abnormality.

These cases involve JT of 1q in a case of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML)-M1, a case of Burkitt lymphoma, and a case of BCR/ABL-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as a JT of 13q in a case of AML-M5, and a JT of 11q segment in a case of undifferentiated leukemia. To our knowledge, with regard to hematologic malignancies, this study presents the first case of JT associated with AML-M1, the first case of JT involving 13q as a donor chromosome, and the first report of JT involving a segment of 11q containing two copies of the MLL gene, jumping on to two recipient chromosomes in each cell line and resulting in six copies of the MLL gene.

Environmental factors which have been considered to play a role include infectious agents such as viruses or bacteria. The search for a common initiating infection in the aetiology of Type 1 diabetes as proved thus far inconclusive. An alternative way of considering a role for infection is that infection may have historically prevented the development of autoimmune disease.

In this paper we show that BPC causes apoptosis in leukaemia cells (HL60 and Jurkat), but not in normal human lymphocytes. IC(50) values obtained for both cell lines using the MTT and trypan blue exclusion assays 5h after BPC treatment were lower than 8.0 microM. Using metachromatic fluorophore, acridine orange, we observed that BPC elicited lysosomal rupture of leukaemic cells. Furthermore, BPC triggered caspase-3 and caspase-6 activation and apoptosis in cell lines, inducing chromatin condensation, apoptotic bodies, and DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, the lysosomal cathepsin B inhibitor CA074 markedly decreased BPC-induced caspase-3 and caspase-6 activation as well as cell death. Lysosomal BPC-induced membrane destabilisation was not dependent on reactive oxygen species generation, which was consistent with the absence of cellular HL60 and Jurkat membrane lipid peroxidation. We conclude that, following BPC treatment, lysosomal membrane rupture precedes cell death and the apoptotic signalling pathway is initiated by the release of cathepsin B in the cytoplasm of leukaemia cells. As no toxic effects for human lymphocytes were observed, we suggest that BPC is more selective for transformed cells, mainly due to their exacerbated lysosome expression.","['Departamento de Farmacologia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']","['S0009-2797(08)00570-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cbi.2008.10.034 [doi]']",20081105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study have demonstrated that the cladribine and cyclophosphamide regimen may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population. METHODS: In this study, the authors retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of 2-CdA with cyclophosphamide combination (the CC regimen) in 20 patients with previously untreated B-cell CLL who had 17p13.1 deletion reported to the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) registry. The CC regimen consisted of 2-CdA at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m2 given intravenously for 3 consecutive days. The CC cycles were repeated at 28-day intervals for up to 6 cycles. RESULTS: Overall, 16 of 20 patients (80%) responded to CC therapy, including 10 patients (50%) who obtained a complete response and 6 patients (30%) who obtained a partial response. The median progression-free survival reached 23 months (95% confidence interval, 5-41 months). The overall survival probability at 2 years was 52.5% (95% confidence interval, 26%-79%). Treatment toxicity generally was acceptable. Infections were the most common grade 3/4 complications and occurred in 6 patients (30%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, the results demonstrated that the CC regimen produced a relatively high response rate in patients with previously untreated CLL who had 17p13.1/TP53 deletion, although the response duration and survival were not satisfactory. It is possible that a combination of the CC regimen with p53-independent agents may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population.","['Department of Hematology, Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland. robaktad@csk.umed.lodz.pl']",['10.1002/cncr.24003 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2008 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,

METHODS: The design of the study was a population-based age- and sex-matched case-control study, which collected cases of adult acute leukaemia between 1991 and 1996. Caucasian cases (807) and 1593 Caucasian controls were interviewed in person using a highly structured questionnaire. General practitioner medical records were abstracted for previous topical chloramphenicol use. RESULTS: 797 cases and 1570 controls were included in the analysis. No association was observed for topical chloramphenicol use and acute leukaemia (adjusted odds ratio, 1-year lag period (OR) 0.91 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.70-1.17). Similar results were observed when the analysis was repeated by diagnostic subgroup and sex. For all the data, a small, non-significant increased risk was observed (OR=1.21, 95% CI 0.65-2.25) if chloramphenicol had been prescribed three, or more times, but there was no statistically significant dose-response relationship (chi(2)=1.40, two-sided p=0.24). CONCLUSIONS: The results, based on a robust study design, show no evidence of an increased risk of developing adult acute leukaemia after topical chloramphenicol use.

Distance was a good exposure proxy for a single transmitter only which uses the frequency bands of amplitude modulated radio, whereas it appeared to be of limited informative value in studies involving several transmitters, particularly if these are operating in different frequency bands. The analysis of the agreement between calculated RF-EMF and measured RF-EMF showed a sensitivity of 76.6% and a specificity of 97.4%, leading to an exposure misclassification that still allows one to detect a true odds ratio as low as 1.4 with a statistical power of >80% at a two-sided significance level of 5% in a study with 2,000 cases and 6,000 controls. Thus, calculated RF-EMF is confirmed to be an appropriate exposure metric in large-scale epidemiological studies on broadcast transmitters.","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. sven@cancer.dk']",['10.1002/bem.20460 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Purine nucleotide analogues and alkylating agents feature frequently in combination regimens to treat the malignant state, but their use has not led to any significant improvement in patient survival. Consequently, there still remains a need for alternative small-molecule chemotherapeutics. Natural products are an unparalleled source of drug leads, and an unending inspiration for the design of small-molecule libraries for drug discovery. The screening of focused libraries of natural-product-like spiroketal and fused bicyclic acetal small molecules against primary CLL cells has led to the identification of a small series of novel and potent cytotoxic agents towards primary CLL cells. The validation of the activity of these molecules is delineated through a series of synthesis and screening iterations, whereas preliminary mode of action studies positively indicate their ability to induce cell death via an apoptotic pathway with no evidence of necrosis to further support their potential as novel chemotherapeutic agents.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Cambridge, Lensfield Road, Cambridge CB21EW, UK.']",['10.1002/cmdc.200800265 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 206 patients were enrolled after HSCH in Shariati Hospital between 1993 and 2007. There was evidence of marked departures from the proportional hazards assumption with two prognostic factors, relapse and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) (P < .001). Performance among AFT and Cox's models was assessed using explained variation and goodness of fit methods. Discrimination among the exponential, Weibull, generalized gamma (GG), log-logistic, and lognormal distributions was done using maximum likelihood and Akaike information criteria. RESULTS: The 5-year OS was 52% (95%CI: 47.3-56.7). Peak mortality hazard occurred at months 6-7 after HSCT followed by a decreasing trend. In univariate analysis, the data was better fitted by GG distribution than by other distributions. Univariate analysis using GG distribution showed a positive association between OS with acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) (P = .021), no relapse (P < .001), cGVHD (P < .001), neutrophil recovery (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P < .001). Based on Cox PH models; however cGVHD and relapse were the predictive factors of OS (P < .001). Multivariate analysis indicated that, OS is related to relapse (P < .001) and platelet recovery (P = .037), where predictive power of Weibull AFT models was superior to Cox PH model and Cox with time-varying coefficient (R2 = 0.46 for AFT, R2 = .21 for Cox PH and R2 = .34 for Cox time-varying coefficient). Cox-Snell residual shows Weibull AFT fitted to data better than other distributions in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: We concluded that AFT distributions can be a useful tool for recognizing prognostic factors of OS in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients.","['Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Iran. sayehmiri@razi.tums.ac.ir']","['1756-9966-27-74 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-9966-27-74 [doi]']",20081123,,PMC2611969,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was undertaken to analyze the clinical significance of PML body expression in primary tumor samples from malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) and liposarcoma patients. METHODS: We studied MFH and liposarcoma samples from 55 patients for PML bodies. Fluorescent immunostaining of PML bodies was performed in the paraffin-embedded tumor sections. RESULTS: PML body immunostaining was identified in 63.9% of MFH and 63.2% of liposarcoma samples. PML body expression rates of all sarcoma cells were 1.5 +/- 1.8% (range: 0-7.0) in MFH and 1.3 +/- 1.4% (0-5.2) in liposarcoma samples. PML body expression (p = 0.0053) and a high rate of PML body expression (p = 0.0012) were significantly greater prognostic risk factors for death than the other clinical factors in MFH patients. All liposarcoma patients without expression of PML were disease free at the end of the study.

However, there have been few studies on the short-term influence of HSCT on psychological distress. METHODS: The subjects were 71 patients with hematological malignancies who underwent HSCT: 33 with acute leukemia, 19 with chronic leukemia, nine with myelodysplastic syndrome, and 10 with malignant lymphoma. Psychological distress was assessed prior to HSCT and on the seventh day after HSCT using the Profile of Mood States (POMS). RESULTS: With regard to Anger-Hostility, the interaction of time (pre- and post-HSCT) and group (the four groups) was significant in male patients (p = 0.04), but not in female patients. With regard to the other subscales of POMS, there was no significant main effect or interaction in male or female patients. CONCLUSION: It may be important to provide psychological support to patients throughout the period of HSCT in consideration of differences in mood changes associated with the underlying disease and patient sex in order to provide efficient psychiatric intervention for both better psychiatric and survival outcomes.","['Department of Stress Sciences and Psychosomatic Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, the University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']","['1751-0759-2-24 [pii]', '10.1186/1751-0759-2-24 [doi]']",20081121,,PMC2603014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Microbubbles generated around gold spheres and shells with 10-ns 532-nm laser pulses in individual living cells (leukemia cells, lung and squamous carcinoma cancer cells) have amplified optical side scattering up to 1800-times relative to that of intracellular gold NPs, and without detectable damage to host cells. We explain the discovered optical amplification by the endocytosis-mediated clustering of NPs in cells, and by the selective generation of microbubbles (that do not disrupt the host cell) around these clusters at minimal levels of laser pulse fluence. CONCLUSIONS: Photothermal bubbles generated around laser-activated gold NPs may significantly improve the sensitivity and specificity of cell imaging, and can be considered as a new type of optical cellular probes.","['AV Lykov Heat & Mass Transfer Institute, Minsk, 220072, Belarus.']",['10.2217/17435889.3.6.797 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematol. 32, 1088-1096, 2004). It is unclear whether such stimulating effects induced by low-dose radiation can also occur in tumor cells. In the present study, cells of two leukemia cell lines and five solid tumor cell lines together with four normal human cell lines were used to determine whether exposure to low-dose radiation (25 to 200 mGy X rays) can cause a stimulating effect on cell proliferation. A stimulating effect was found in the normal cell lines but not in the two leukemia and five solid tumor cell lines in response to low-dose radiation exposure in vitro. Examination of cell cycling changes and cell death for these cells by flow cytometry at different times after low-dose irradiation did not identify any changes attributable to the distinct effects of low-dose radiation on cell proliferation between tumor and normal cells. To provide further evidence for the absence of low-dose radiation-induced stimulating effects in tumor cells in vivo, cells of two solid tumor cell lines were implanted in nude mice. Exposure of tumor cells in vitro before implantation in nude mice or of tumor-bearing mice to low-dose radiation (75 mGy X rays) did not stimulate tumor growth compared to the tumor-bearing mice without low-dose radiation exposure. These results suggest that low-dose radiation stimulates growth of normal cells but not of leukemia and solid tumor cells in vitro and also does not stimulate growth of solid tumor cells in vivo.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, The First Clinical College, Jilin University Normal Bethune Health Science Center, Changchun 130021, China.']",['10.1667/rr1132.1 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is increasing recognition that sleep intersects with cancer through the circadian control of the cell cycle and that sleep problems are one of the 'effects' of cancer, its treatments, or both. Recognition of these intersections will facilitate new areas of treatment and the use of proven clinical interventions for sleep problems in cancer survivors. RECENT FINDINGS: Discoveries in circadian biology have revealed that the biologic clocks, which control sleep/wake rhythms, are present in all cells and exert considerable control over the cell cycle. This has opened new opportunities for improving efficacy, decreasing toxicity, or both of cancer therapy through circadian timing of chemotherapy. Excessive daytime sleepiness has emerged as one of the most common, but often unrecognized, sleep symptoms in cancer survivors.

Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is an option for patients up to 60 years and may contribute to improving the outcome for these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Allogen stem cell transplantation was performed in 61 high-risk patients (38 men and 23 women) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia at Rikshospitalet between 1985 and 2005. 19 patients were transplanted in first remission and 42 at a later stage of the disease. RESULTS: At the end of 2006, 26 patients (43%) were alive; 21 (35%) in complete remission and 5 with relapse. Median survival time was 1.5 years. Relapse was the most important cause of treatment failure (38%), but transplantation-related mortality (25%) was also a substantial problem. Estimated 5-year actuarial leukemia-free survival was 35 %. INTERPRETATION: Our results are in line with international reports on the results of allogen stem cell transplantation in high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. This treatment offers cure for patients with an otherwise dismal prognosis. A larger number of patients should be offered such treatment during the first remission than what was the case in the 20-year period this study took place.","['Seksjon for blodsykdommer, Medisinsk avdeling, Rikshospitalet, 0027 Oslo.']",['1765666 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,Allogen stamcelletransplantasjon hos voksne med akutt lymfoblastisk leukemi.,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we report that PML aggregated in nuclear bodies in syncytia elicited by the envelope glycoprotein complex (Env) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) in vitro. PML aggregation occurred after the fusion of nuclei (karyogamy) within syncytia but before the apoptotic program was activated. The aggregation of PML was detectable in syncytia present in the brain or lymph nodes from patients with HIV-1 infection, as well as in a fraction of blood leukocytes, correlating with viral status. Using a range of specific inhibitors of PML (the oncogenic PML/RARalpha fusion product or specific small interfering RNAs), we demonstrated that, in Env-elicited syncytia, PML was required for activating phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which colocalized with PML in nuclear bodies, in a molecular complex that also involved topoisomerase IIbeta-binding protein 1. PML knockdown thus inhibited the ATM-dependent DNA damage response that culminates in the activation of p53, p53-dependent transcription of pro-apoptotic genes and cell death. Infection of CD4-expressing cells with HIV-1 also induced syncytial apoptosis, which could be suppressed by inhibiting PML. Altogether, these data indicate that PML activation is a critical early event that participates in the apoptotic demise of HIV-1-elicited syncytia.","['INSERM U848, Institut Gustave Roussy, Universite Paris Sud, Paris 11, 39 rue Camille-Desmoulins, F-94805 Villejuif, France.']","['cdd2008158 [pii]', '10.1038/cdd.2008.158 [doi]']",20081121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This requires a permanent pool of NSCs, the size of which needs to be tightly controlled. The gp130-associated cytokines ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) have been implicated in regulating NSC self-renewal and differentiation during embryonic development and in the adult brain. To study the relevance of the two cytokines in vivo, we analyzed precursor cell proliferation and neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of CNTF- and LIF-deficient mouse mutants. The number of radial glia-like NSCs, proliferative activity, and generation of new neurons were all reduced in CNTF(-/-) mutants but unaltered in LIF(-/-) animals. Conditional ablation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) gene under the control of the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter resulted in a reduction of neurogenesis similar to that in CNTF(-/-) mice. The size of the granule cell layer was decreased in both mutants. Treatment of neurosphere cultures prepared from adult forebrain with CNTF inhibited overall proliferative activity but increased the number of NSCs as indicated by enhanced secondary neurosphere formation and upregulated expression of stem cell markers. Knockdown of STAT3 with short interfering RNA inhibited CNTF effects on neurospheres, and knockdown of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) enhanced them. Our results provide evidence that CNTF-induced STAT3 signaling is essential for the formation and/or maintenance of the neurogenic subgranular zone in the adult dentate gyrus and suggest that CNTF is required to keep the balance between NSC self-renewal and the generation of neuronal progenitors.","['Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']","['stemcells.2008-0234 [pii]', '10.1634/stemcells.2008-0234 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sustained HoxA10 expression during differentiation has been described in poor prognosis human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Consistent with this, engineered overexpression of HoxA10 in murine bone marrow induces a myeloproliferative disorder that progresses to AML over time. This murine model suggests that HoxA10 overexpression is sufficient for myeloproliferation but that differentiation block, and therefore AML, requires acquisition of additional mutations. In myeloid progenitor cells, HoxA10 represses transcription of genes that encode phagocyte effector proteins such as gp91PHOX and p67PHOX. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HoxA10 during myelopoiesis decreases binding to these target genes. In immature myeloid cells, HoxA10 also activates transcription of the DUSP4 gene that encodes Mkp2, an anti-apoptotic protein. HoxA10 binding to the DUSP4 promoter decreases during myelopoiesis. Therefore, both myeloid-specific gene repression and DUSP4 activation by HoxA10 decrease during myelopoiesis. This results in phenotypic differentiation and facilitates apoptosis as differentiation proceeds. HoxA10 is de-phosphorylated by SHP2 protein-tyrosine phosphatase in myeloid progenitors. This mechanism maintains HoxA10 in a nonphosphorylated state in immature, but not differentiating, myeloid cells. Constitutively active SHP2 mutants have been described in human AML, which dephosphorylate HoxA10 throughout myelopoiesis.

Because both HoxA10 overexpression and constitutive SHP2 activation are found in poor prognosis human AML, these studies contribute to understanding biochemical aspects of disease progression in myeloid malignancy.","['The Feinberg School of Medicine and The Robert H.

Tissue-specific stem cells concurrently have self-renewal capacity and potential to give rise to all types of mature cells in their tissue. The differentiation process of the tissue-specific stem cell is successive restriction of these capacities. The first progeny of tissue-specific stem cells are multipotent progenitors (MPPs) that lose long-term self-renewal capacity yet have full lineage potential. MPPs in turn give rise to oligopotent progenitors, which then commit into lineage-restricted progenitors. This hierarchical system enables a lifelong supply of matured functional cells that generally have a short life span and a relatively high turnover rate. In this chapter, we review our findings and other key experiments that have led to the establishment of the current cellular stem and progenitor hierarchy in the blood-forming systems of mice and humans for both normal and leukemic hematopoiesis. We also review select signaling pathways intrinsic to normal hematopoietic and leukemic stem cell populations as well our recent findings elucidating the possible origin of the leukemia stem cell.","['Stanford Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA.']","['sqb.2008.73.031 [pii]', '10.1101/sqb.2008.73.031 [doi]']",20081106,['R01CA86017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reports that only rare cell populations within human leukemias seeded leukemia in mice stimulated the now widely embraced hypothesis that only such ""cancer stem cells"" maintain all tumor growth. However, the mouse microenvironment might instead fail to support the dominant human tumor cell populations. Indeed, on syngeneic transplantation of mouse lymphomas and leukemias, we and other investigators have found that a substantial proportion (>10%) of their cells drive tumor growth. Thus, dominant clones rather than rare cancer stem cells appear to sustain many tumors. Another issue is the role of cell survival in tumorigenesis. Because tumor development can be promoted by the overexpression of prosurvival genes such as bcl-2, we are exploring the role of endogenous Bcl-2-like proteins in lymphomagenesis. The absence of endogenous Bcl-2 in mice expressing an Emu-myc transgene reduced mature B-cell numbers and enhanced their apoptosis, but unexpectedly, lymphoma development was undiminished or even delayed. This suggests that these tumors originate in an earlier cell type, such as the pro-B or pre-B cell, and that the nascent neoplastic clones do not require Bcl-2 but may instead be protected by a Bcl-2 relative.","['Walter & Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne 3050, Australia.']","['sqb.2008.73.004 [pii]', '10.1101/sqb.2008.73.004 [doi]']",20081106,"['CA 43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,62,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the functional role of CD4(+)CD25(+) Foxp3(+) Tregs in these different manifestations. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased levels of Tregs in NZB mice compared to healthy C57Bl/6 controls. Aged NZB mice that have developed a B-1 cell malignancy identified as IgM(+)CD5(+), have the most pronounced increase in Tregs. Ex vivo treatment of splenocytes from NZB mice with IFN-alpha resulted in a decrease in the frequency of Tregs and malignant B-1 cells. In vivo treatment of both NZB and C57Bl/6 mice with poly (I:C), a potent inducer of IFN-alpha, also led to a decrease in the levels of Tregs and malignant B-1 cells (NZB only) while amplifying autoimmune manifestations. These results indicate that while high levels of Tregs found in NZB mice might suppress a more severe autoimmune disease, they may also contribute to the development of the B cell malignancy.","['University of Medicine and Dentistry, New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']","['S0896-8411(08)00105-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaut.2008.10.001 [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial lesions appear as erythematous papules that turn into grouped vesicles and pustules eventuating into crusts. In most cases, the features are so characteristic that a diagnosis can be made by history and physical examination without further diagnostic testing. However, patients who are immunosuppressed (including those with hematologic malignancies) often have atypical presentations of herpesvirus infections. These cases require a high index of suspicion and appropriate diagnostic testing for proper management. In this report, we describe two patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who developed atypical presentations of herpes zoster and herpes simplex infections. Herpetic infections should always be in the differential diagnosis of cutaneous ulcerations with necrosis in patients who are immunocompromised. Because of the atypical appearance of the lesions, the diagnosis may be confused or mistaken for several other conditions.","['Department of Dermatology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213, USA.']","['S0190-9622(08)01168-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jaad.2008.08.047 [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an important second messenger involved in the regulation of various cellular processes and exhibits antiproliferative and differentiative properties in various tumor cell lines. The mechanisms by which HNE affects cell growth and differentiation are only partially clarified. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) have the ability to regulate several cellular processes, we hypothesized that HNE, in addition to other mechanisms, could affect miRNA expression. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide miRNA expression profiling of HNE-treated HL-60 leukemic cells. Among 470 human miRNAs, 10 were found to be differentially expressed between control and HNE-treated cells (at p<0.05). Six miRNAs were down-regulated (miR-181a*, miR-199b, miR-202, miR-378, miR-454-3p, miR-575) and 4 were up-regulated (miR-125a, miR-339, miR-663, miR-660). Three of these regulated miRNAs (miR-202, miR-339, miR-378) were further assayed and validated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Moreover, consistent with the down-regulation of miR-378, HNE also induced the expression of the SUFU protein, a tumor suppressor recently identified as a target of miR-378. The finding that HNE could regulate the expression of miRNAs and their targets opens new perspectives on the understanding of HNE-controlled pathways. A functional analysis of 191 putative gene targets of miRNAs modulated by HNE is discussed.","['Dipartimento di Medicina e Oncologia Sperimentale, Sezione di Patologia Generale, Universita di Torino, Corso Raffaello 30, 10125 Torino, Italy. stefania.pizzimenti@unito.it']","['S0891-5849(08)00614-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.10.035 [doi]']",20081030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 37 months, OS for all patients was 23%, post-transplant relapse occurred in 11 patients, and 10 patients died from treatment-related complications. The overall outcome and survival was independent of cytogenetic abnormalities and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS). However, we identified comorbidity as defined by the haematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index (HCT-CI), as a significant adverse prognostic variable in our MDS patients.

Cladribine (2CdA) and dasatinib are two drugs that counteract the in vitro growth of neoplastic mast cells in SM. However, only little is known about the in vivo effects of these drugs in SM. PATIENT AND METHODS: We report on a patient with highly aggressive interferon-alpha-resistant SM who was treated with 2CdA and dasatinib. In vitro pretesting revealed a response of neoplastic mast cells to both compounds with reasonable IC(50) values. RESULTS: The patient was treated with six cycles of 2CdA (0.13 mg kg(-1) intravenously daily on 5 consecutive days). Despite a short-lived major clinical response and a decrease in serum tryptase, the patient progressed to mast cell leukaemia after the sixth cycle of 2CdA. The patient then received two further courses of 2CdA followed by treatment with dasatinib (100 mg per os daily). However, no major response was obtained and the patient died from disease progression after 2 months. CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with rapidly progressing aggressive SM, neither 2CdA nor dasatinib produced a long-lasting response in vivo, despite encouraging in vitro results. For such patients, alternative treatment strategies have to be developed.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.']","['ECI2036 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2362.2008.02036.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The four LMO and 12 LIM-HD proteins in mammals are expressed in a combinatorial manner in many cell types, forming a transcriptional 'LIM code'. The proteins all contain a pair of closely spaced LIM domains near their N-termini that mediate protein-protein interactions, including binding to the approximately 30-residue LID (LIM interaction domain) of the essential co-factor protein Ldb1 (LIM domain-binding protein 1). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the LIM code, we have determined the molecular basis of binding of LMO and LIM-HD proteins for Ldb1(LID) through a series of structural, mutagenic and biophysical studies. These studies provide an explanation for why Ldb1 binds the LIM domains of the LMO/LIM-HD family, but not LIM domains from other proteins. The LMO/LIM-HD family exhibit a range of affinities for Ldb1, which influences the formation of specific functional complexes within cells. We have also identified an additional LIM interaction domain in one of the LIM-HD proteins, Isl1. Despite low sequence similarity to Ldb1(LID), this domain binds another LIM-HD protein, Lhx3, in an identical manner to Ldb1(LID). Through our and other studies, it is emerging that the multiple layers of competitive binding involving LMO and LIM-HD proteins and their partner proteins contribute significantly to cell fate specification and development.","['School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences, The University of Sydney, NSW, Australia. j.matthews@usyd.edu.au']","['BST0361393 [pii]', '10.1042/BST0361393 [doi]']",,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously reported that LIF plays a critical role in regulating the terminal differentiation of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Here, we demonstrate that LIF plays a complementary role in supporting the survival of immature OSNs. Mature OSNs express LIF, which may be elaborated in a paracrine manner to influence adjacent neurons. LIF null mice display more apoptotic immature neurons than do their wild-type littermates. LIF treatment of dissociated OSNs in vitro significantly reduces the apoptosis of immature OSNs. Double immunocytochemical analysis indicates that the survival of immature OSNs is dependent on the presence of LIF. LIF activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways and induces the expression of the antiapoptotic molecule Bcl-2 in OSNs, whereas inhibition of the PI3K pathway blocks LIF-dependent OSN survival and Bcl-2 induction. Thus, LIF plays a central role in maintaining the size and integrity of the population of immature neurons within the olfactory epithelium; this population is critical to the rapid recovery of olfactory function after injury. LIF may play a similar role elsewhere in the CNS and thus be important for manipulation of stem cell populations for therapeutic interventions.","['Department of Oral Anatomy and Neurobiology, Kyungpook National University School of Dentistry, Daegu, Republic of Korea.']",['10.1002/jnr.21919 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we stably expressed BMI-1 in a human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The expression of wild-type BMI-1 induced the malignant transformation of HaCaT cells in vitro. More importantly, we found that expression of BMI-1 promoted formation of squamous cell carcinomas in vivo. Furthermore, we showed that BMI-1 expression led to the downregulation of tumor suppressors, such as p16INK4a and p14ARF, cell adhesion molecules, such as E-Cadherin, and differentiation related factor, such as KRT6.

Recently, MSCs have gained further interests after the demonstration of an immunosuppressive role. However, it's still unclear whether the immunosuppressive capability of MSCs will be altered with disease state. In this study, our results showed that MSCs derived from patients with lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkin disease (HD), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) capable of suppressing the proliferation of T-lymphocyte stimulated in a mixed-lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The immunosuppressive effect of MSCs derived from ALL, HD and NHL on T-cell proliferation was dose-dependent. The supernatants of MSCs derived from ALL, HD and NHL had effect on T-cell proliferation. By using neutralising monoclonal antibodies, we found that transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and hepatocyte growth factor were major mediators of T-cell suppression by MSCs derived from ALL, HD and NHL. Although MSCs derived from patients with myelodysplastics syndromes (MDS) could inhibit T-cell proliferation stimulated with mitogen or in MLR, the inhibitory effect of MDS-MSCs was impaired. However, adherent cells derived from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) showed abnormal immunomodulatory functions.

Both cytokines regulate cell-survival and cell-death in leukemic cells. TNF-alpha and LT-alpha are highly produced in chronic lymphotic leukemia (CLL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients. Genetic polymorphism within regulatory regions of these cytokine genes can alter their expression levels. This study investigates an influence of TNF-alpha - 308 and LT-alpha + 250 polymorphisms on the activity of alkaline DNase in mononuclear cells of both patient groups as a potent biochemical marker of DNA fragmentation in the terminal phase of apoptosis. Study was performed on mononuclear cells of CLL and NHL patients. SNP were obtained by PCR-RFLP method. The activity of alkaline DNase was measured by spectrophotometric method. The study provided evidence of the influence of TNFG/A genotype and A alleles in the susceptibility to NHL, since the association of LT-alphaG/G genotype with CLL was observed. High-producing TNF-alpha - 308/LT-alpha + 250 heterozygous haplotype is associated with high NHL incidence. The investigated SNP influence the activity of alkaline DNase in CLL and NHL patients.

However, insertion and maintenance of CVCs are susceptible to complications. Study design and methods data concerning 388 consecutive catheterisations, performed in oncohematologic patients between April 2003 and December 2004, were prospectively collected. At insertion thrombocytopenia was present in 109 cases (28.1%) and neutropenia in 67 (17.3%). Hemorrhage after CVC insertion occurred in five thrombocytopenic patients (1.3%). The median duration of catheterisation was 18.8 days (range 1-89), longer in the 7-French CVCs utilised in leukemic patients (24.3 days) and shorter in 12-French CVCs (11 days), used for PBSC harvesting. Deep venous thrombosis was diagnosed in 13 cases (3.3%). Ninety-two catheterisations (12.6/1000 days-catheter) were complicated by infections: 19 local infections (4.8%) and 73 (18.8%) bacteraemias of which 45 (11.6%) were catheter-related, mainly due to Gram positive germs (32/45, 71.1%). The frequency of catheter-related bacteraemia was 7.2 events/1000 days-catheter. Thirteen CVCs were removed due to thrombosis, 15 due to infections, 20 due to malfunction, the remaining 333 at patients discharge. At univariate analysis high-dose chemotherapy (p = 0.013), 7-Fr lumen (p = 0.023), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (p = 0.001), duration of neutropenia >10 days and length of catheterisation were significantly correlated to infection. Multivariate analysis confirmed the duration of catheterisation, AML and high-dose chemotherapy as risk factors. Even though hematological in-patients are at increased risk for bleeding and infections, non-tunnelled CVCs offer a safe venous access also in patients affected by severe thrombocytopenia and prolonged neutropenia.","[""Department of Hematology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milano, Italy. annamaria.nosari@ospedaleniguarda.it""]","['905672670 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802409930 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The risk factors to develop a decline in platelets after infusion of rituximab were pre-existent thrombocytopenia, advanced lymphoma stage, bone marrow infiltration, splenomegaly, leukemic presentation, and Burkitt lymphoma histology. In conclusion, a decline in platelet count after administration of rituximab was observed in patients with NHL, mainly those with pre-existing thrombocytopenia.","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Universitaetsklinikum Aachen, Aachen, Germany.']","['905676417 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802503377 [doi]']",,,,,['Leuk Lymphoma. 2008 Nov;49(11):2035-6.

AIMS: We aimed to characterize hematological abnormalities in adult patients with DS and determine their long-term significance. METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of nine DS patients referred to the adult hematology service in our institution between May 2001 and April 2008. Data collected were: full blood count (FBC), comorbidities, investigations performed, duration of follow-up and outcome to most recent follow-up. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 26 months (9-71). Of the nine patients, two had myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at presentation. Of these, one progressed, with increasing marrow failure, and requiring support with transfusions and gCSF. The remaining eight patients, with a variety of hematological abnormalities including leukopenia, macrocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, had persistently abnormal FBCs. However there was no evidence of progression, and no patient has evolved to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). CONCLUSIONS: MDS is a complication of DS and may require supportive therapy. However, minor hematological abnormalities are common in adult DS patients, and may not signify underlying marrow disease.","[""Department of Haematology, Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, Incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght, D24, Dublin, Ireland.

Recent reports indicate that this effect is due to activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, what causes this activation has been unclear. We examined the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on the human leukemia cell line HL60 and the econazole (Ec) resistant HL60 clone E2R2. Ec depletes Ca(2+) from the ER and blocks Ca(2+) influx in mammalian cells, leading to activation of the UPR and apoptosis. EPA inhibited growth of HL60 cells strongly, while E2R2 cells were much less affected. Gene expression analysis of HL60 cells revealed extensive changes in transcripts related to the ER homeostasis, Ca(2+)-homeostasis and cell cycle/apoptosis. Protein levels of phosphorylated eIF2alpha, a selective translation inhibitor and UPR hallmark, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and sequestosome-1 were moderately increased, whereas the cell cycle/progression protein cyclin D1 was decreased in HL60. In contrast, EPA concentrations that strongly inhibited and caused activation of the UPR in HL60 cells had no effect on the expression level of these UPR markers in E2R2 cells. Given that the only known difference between these cells is Ec-resistance, our results strongly suggest that the inhibitory effect of EPA on HL60 cells is initially meditated through alterations of the Ca(2+)-homeostasis followed by activation of the UPR.","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Erling Skjalgssons gate 1, 7006 Trondheim, Norway.""]",['10.1007/s11745-008-3263-5 [doi]'],20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell death rates were determined 72 h after irradiation. Hypoxic cells exposed to the proton beam underwent a typical apoptotic program, showing condensed nuclei, fragmented DNA ladders, and poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis revealed a significant increase in Annexin-V-positive cells. Cells treated with the proton beam and hypoxia displayed increased expression of p53, p21 and Bax, but decreased levels of phospho-Rb, Bcl-2 and XIAP, as well as activated caspase-9 and -3. The proton beam with hypoxia induced cell death in wild-type HCT116 cells, but not in a p53 knockout cell line, demonstrating a requirement for p53. As reactive oxygen species (ROS) were also significantly increased, apoptosis could also be abolished by treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated by the treatment, and their respective DN mutants restored the cell death induced by either proton therapy alone or with hypoxia. In conclusion, proton beam treatment did not differently regulate cancer cell apoptosis either in normoxic or hypoxic conditions via a p53-dependent mechanism and by the activation of p38/JNK MAPK pathways through ROS.","['School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, College of Natural Sciences, Kyungpook National University, Daegu 702-701, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functionally, Frizzled-4 expression modulates apoptosis and enhances Wnt3a induced beta-catenin stability in myeloid progenitor cells.

Although rearranged MYC/8q24 (R8q24) is characteristic of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), little information is available on other cytogenetic abnormalities and their prognostic importance. We performed an international review of 238 abnormal karyotypes in childhood mature B-NHL treated on FAB/LMB96: 76% BL, 8% Burkitt-like lymphoma, 13% diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The main BL R8q24-associated chromosomal aberrations were +1q (29%), +7q and del(13q) (14% each). The DLBCL appeared heterogeneous and more complex. Incidence of R8q24 (34%) was higher than reported in adult DLBCL. The prognostic value of cytogenetic abnormalities on EFS was studied by Cox model controlling for the known risk factors: R8q24, +7q and del(13q) were independently associated with a significant inferior EFS (hazard ratio: 6.1 (P=0.030), 2.5 (P=0.015) and 4.0 (P=0.0003), respectively). The adverse prognosis of R8q24 was observed only in DLBCL, whereas del(13q) and +7q had a similar effect in DLBCL and BL. These results emphasize the significant biological heterogeneity and the development of cytogenetic risk-adapted therapy in childhood mature B-NHL.","['Biological Hematological Department, CHU Avicenne-Universite Paris 13, Bobigny, France. helene.antoine-poirel@uclouvain.be']","['leu2008312 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.312 [doi]']",20081120,"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2988438,['NIHMS107551'],,,,['FAB/LMB 96 International Study Committee'],,,,"['Avet-Loiseau H', 'Baranger L', 'Barin C', 'Bastard C', 'Bernheim A', 'Bertheas MF', 'Bilhou-Nabera C', 'Borie C', 'Caillet-Bauchu E', 'Capdano AM', 'Collonge-Rame MA', 'Cornillet P', 'Couturier J', 'Dastugue N', 'Daudignon A', 'Gachard N', 'Gregoire MJ', 'Heimann P', 'Henry C', 'Lai JL', 'Leroux D', 'Lessard M', 'Luquet I', 'Mellink CH', 'Nadal N', 'Pages MP', 'Penther D', 'Perissel B', 'Raynaud S', 'Talman P', 'Taviaux S', 'Tigaud I', 'Van den Akker J', 'Beigel J', 'Benn P', 'Cantu E', 'Carlson K', 'Cooley L', 'Dawson A', 'Dev VG', 'Dewald G', 'Drumheller T', 'Fink J', 'Gadi I', 'Hanna J', 'Glassman A', 'Harrison K', 'Heerema N', 'Higgins J', 'Higgins R', 'Hirsch B', 'Horsman D', 'Kalousek D', 'Koduru P', 'Lebo R', 'Li X', 'Magenis RE', 'McFadden K', 'McGavron L', 'McMorrow L', 'Murch A', 'Opheim K', 'Panzar D', 'Pasztor L', 'Pettigrew A', 'Philips C', 'Rao K', 'Rao PN', 'Rouston D', 'Sanger W', 'Satya-Prakash KL', 'Schwartz S', 'Sekhon GS', 'Shaw G', 'Shekter-Levin S', 'Spinner N', 'Stanley W', 'Storto P', 'Thangavelu M', 'Theil K', 'Vance G', 'VanDyke D', 'Zadeh T', 'Andrews K', 'Booth M', 'Bown N', 'Davies T', 'Grace E', 'Griffiths M', 'Howard P', 'Hughes D', 'Kempski H', 'Lillington D', 'Lowther G', 'Martin K', 'Roberts P', 'Ross F', 'Sadler J', 'Stallings R', 'Stevenson D', 'Swansbury J', 'Talley P', 'Telford N', 'Walker H']","['Avet-Loiseau, H', 'Baranger, L', 'Barin, C', 'Bastard, C', 'Bernheim, A', 'Bertheas, M F', 'Bilhou-Nabera, C', 'Borie, C', 'Caillet-Bauchu, E', 'Capdano, A M', 'Collonge-Rame, M A', 'Cornillet, P', 'Couturier, J', 'Dastugue, N', 'Daudignon, A', 'Gachard, N', 'Gregoire, M J', 'Heimann, P', 'Henry, C', 'Lai, J L', 'Leroux, D', 'Lessard, M', 'Luquet, I', 'Mellink, C H M', 'Nadal, N', 'Pages, M P', 'Penther, D', 'Perissel, B', 'Raynaud, S', 'Talman, P', 'Taviaux, S', 'Tigaud, I', 'Van den Akker, J', 'Beigel, J', 'Benn, P', 'Cantu, E', 'Carlson, K', 'Cooley, L', 'Dawson, A', 'Dev, V G', 'Dewald, G', 'Drumheller, T', 'Fink, J', 'Gadi, I', 'Hanna, J', 'Glassman, A', 'Harrison, K', 'Heerema, N', 'Higgins, J', 'Higgins, R', 'Hirsch, B', 'Horsman, D', 'Kalousek, D', 'Koduru, P', 'Lebo, R', 'Li, X', 'Magenis, R E', 'McFadden, K', 'McGavron, L', 'McMorrow, L', 'Murch, A', 'Opheim, K', 'Panzar, D', 'Pasztor, L', 'Pettigrew, A', 'Philips, C', 'Rao, K', 'Rao, P N', 'Rouston, D', 'Sanger, W', 'Satya-Prakash, K L', 'Schwartz, S', 'Sekhon, G S', 'Shaw, G', 'Shekter-Levin, S', 'Spinner, N', 'Stanley, W', 'Storto, P', 'Thangavelu, M', 'Theil, K', 'Vance, G', 'VanDyke, D', 'Zadeh, T', 'Andrews, K', 'Booth, M', 'Bown, N', 'Davies, T', 'Grace, E', 'Griffiths, M', 'Howard, P', 'Hughes, D', 'Kempski, H', 'Lillington, D', 'Lowther, G', 'Martin, K', 'Roberts, P', 'Ross, F', 'Sadler, J', 'Stallings, R', 'Stevenson, D', 'Swansbury, J', 'Talley, P', 'Telford, N', 'Walker, H']",,,,,,,,,

We investigated the frequency and prognostic significance of NPM1 mutations in childhood AML (n=298), specifically focusing on the CN-AML subgroup (n=100). Mutations were found in 8.4%, and clustered significantly in the CN-AML subgroup (22%). No mutations were found in patients below the age of 3 years; in CN-AML, there was an increasing incidence above this age. In the overall group, NPM1 mutations conferred an independent favorable prognostic impact on event-free survival (5-year pEFS 66 vs 39%; P=0.02), which did not translate into a significantly better overall survival (5-year pOS 68 vs 56%; P=0.30). However, when the favorable cytogenetic subgroups [inv(16) and t(8;21)] were excluded from the NPM1 wild-type group, the difference in pOS was borderline statistically significant (68 vs 45%; P=0.07). In the CN-AML cohort, NPM1 mutations were an independent prognostic factor on pEFS (80 vs 39%; P=0.01), and pOS (85 vs 60%; P=0.06), which was not influenced by FLT3/ITD. However, in NPM1 wild-type CN-AML, FLT3/ITD-positive patients had a significantly worse outcome (pEFS 48 vs 18%; P<0.001).

There are three major indications for the FLC assay in the evaluation and management of multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders (PCD). In the context of screening, the serum FLC assay in combination with serum protein electrophoresis (PEL) and immunofixation yields high sensitivity, and negates the need for 24-h urine studies for diagnoses other than light chain amyloidosis (AL). Second, the baseline FLC measurement is of major prognostic value in virtually every PCD. Third, the FLC assay allows for quantitative monitoring of patients with oligosecretory PCD, including AL, oligosecretory myeloma and nearly two-thirds of patients who had previously been deemed to have non-secretory myeloma. In AL patients, serial FLC measurements outperform PEL and immunofixation. In oligosecretory myeloma patients, although not formally validated, serial FLC measurements reduce the need for frequent bone marrow biopsies. In contrast, there are no data to support using FLC assay in place of 24-h urine PEL for monitoring or for serial measurements in PCD with measurable disease by serum or urine PEL.

At the single parameter level (905 patients), the strongest predictive parameter for the remission status as a dichotomous minimal residual disease (MRD) parameter (positive/negative) has been provided by the BC at day 15 in BM (cutoff: 17 blasts/microl; 50 vs 15%; odds ratio: 5.6; 95% confidence interval: 4.1-7.6, P<0.001), followed by the BRR at day 15 in BM and by the BC at day 8 in pB (odds ratios: 3.8 and 2.6, respectively). In the multiple regression analysis (440 patients), BC in pB (d0 and d8) and in BM (d15) as well as BRR at day 8 in pB provided significantly contributing variables with an overall correct prediction rate of 74.8%. These data show that the quantitative assessment of early response parameters, especially absolute BCs at day 15 in BM, has a predictive impact on the remission status after induction therapy.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Robert-Roessle-Clinic at HELIOS Klinikum Berlin, Charite-Campus Buch, Germany. richard.ratei@helios-kliniken.de']","['leu2008324 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.324 [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,['AIEOP-BFM-FCM-MRD-Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have addressed both these issues. BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines show an increase in DNA breaks after treatment with etoposide as compared to control cells. However, although BCR/ABL-expressing cell lines have an equivalent cell survival, they have an increase in chromosomal translocations after DNA repair as compared to control cells. This demonstrates that BCR/ABL expression decreases the fidelity of DNA repair. To see whether this is true in primary CML samples, normal CD34+ progenitor cells and CML progenitor cells were treated with etoposide. CML progenitor cells have equivalent survival but have an increase in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Spectral karyotyping demonstrates new chromosomal translocations in CML cells, but not normal progenitor cells, consistent with error-prone DNA repair. Taken together, these data demonstrate that BCR/ABL enhances the accumulation of DSBs and alters the apoptotic threshold in CML leading to error-prone DNA repair.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']","['leu2008308 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.308 [doi]']",20081120,"['K01 CA129151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA100885/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3650088,['NIHMS468511'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both cases, the suppressor potential of T(regs) appears to be strongly influenced by their compartmentalization. In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), immune deregulation and autoimmunity in the early stages might lead to ineffective hematopoiesis and bone marrow (BM) failure, whereas late-stage disease is characterized by the immune escape of the malignant clone. We show that these two stages of MDS are associated with differential T(reg) activity. Specifically, we found that in early stage MDS, compared with normal hematopoiesis and late stage MDS, T(regs) are dysfunctional and their BM homing through the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis is seriously impaired as a result of CXCR4 downregulation. Conversely, in late stage MDS, T(regs) are systemically and locally expanded and retain their function and migratory capacity. Moreover, T(reg) levels follow the disease course and are significantly reduced in treatment responding patients. Our findings indicate T(reg) involvement in the pathophysiology of MDS; defective suppressor function and BM trafficking of T(regs) may be important in the autoimmune process of early MDS, but increased T(reg) activity could favor leukemic clone progression in late stage disease.","['Department of Hematology, Democritus University of Thrace Medical School, Alexandroupolis, Greece. ikotsian@med.duth.gr']","['leu2008333 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.333 [doi]']",20081120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To find out at which stage of hematopoietic development these mutations emerge and how they are propagated during hematopoietic differentiation, we analyzed single cells of different hematopoietic subpopulations from CN patients with CSF3R mutations. We found that CSF3R mutations are not restricted to the myeloid compartment but are also detectable in lymphoid cells, although at a much lower percentage. From our observations, we conclude that CSF3R mutations are acquired in multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cells in CN patients and that they are clonally expanded in myeloid cells expressing the G-CSF receptor due to the growth advantage mediated by the CSF3R mutation.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany. germeshausen.manuela@mh-hannover.de']","['S0006-4971(20)37856-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-178087 [doi]']",20081119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One-year survival improved over time in all age groups, whereas 5- and 10-year survival improved in all age groups, except for patients 80+ years. The 5-year relative survival ratios in the last calendar period were 0.65, 0.58, 0.36, 0.15, 0.05, and 0.01 for the age groups 0 to 18, 19 to 40, 41 to 60, 61 to 70, 71 to 80, and 80+ years, respectively. Intensified chemotherapy, a continuous improvement in supportive care, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation are probably the most important factors contributing to this finding. In contrast, there was no improvement in survival in AML patients with a prior diagnosis of a myelodysplastic syndrome during 1993 to 2005 (n = 219). In conclusion, AML survival has improved during the last decades. However, the majority of AML patients die of their disease and age remains an important predictor of prognosis.

The aim of this paper is to systematically review studies on QOL in children during treatment for ALL with consideration to methodological details and quality of studies, empirical findings on QOL as reported by children and parents, and whether children and parents differ in their reports on QOL. Searches were conducted in biomedical, psychological and behavioural science databases. Six papers met inclusion criteria for review: 4 cross-sectional studies and 2 qualitative studies. There was little consistency in how QOL was measured or qualitatively assessed across studies. The quality of most studies was limited by small sample sizes and cross-sectional designs. Children's reports on QOL were represented in 3 studies and discrepancies were found between children's and parent's accounts of QOL. There is a need for ongoing research on QOL in children with ALL that use longitudinal designs, large sample sizes, and child reports of QOL. There is a need for theoretical development of the concept of QOL through concept analysis, grounded theory research and empirical validation of developing theory of QOL. Theoretical development of the concept of QOL will contribute to greater clarification of what is meant by QOL than currently exists which in turn has the potential to advance the methodology of measuring this concept in children.","['Catherine McAuley School of Nursing and Midwifery, Brookfield Health Science Complex, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland. e.savage@ucc.ie']","['S1462-3889(08)00125-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejon.2008.09.001 [doi]']",20081118,,,,,29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unique immune maturational events occur during critical windows of prenatal/perinatal development and environmentally-induced disruption of one-time events can have serious health consequences. Additionally, the specialized immunological conditions necessary to bring a semi-allogeneic fetus to term place restrictions on both the maternal and offspring immune systems. These features combine not only to increase the risk of early-life immune insult (ELII), which includes xenobiotically-induced developmental immunotoxicity (DIT), but also to influence the nature of DIT-associated diseases for the child. Exposure to certain toxicants as well as maternal infections and other pregnancy stressors is known to induce postnatal immune dysfunction. Because dysfunctional immune responses to childhood infections have been proposed to play a role in childhood leukemia, DIT is a potential risk factor for this disease. This review details the range of disease susceptibilities impacted by DIT and discusses the importance of effective DIT safety testing for drugs and chemicals as a preventative measure.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, College of Veterinary Medicine, C5-135 VMC North Tower Road, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA. rrd1@cornell.edu']","['S1079-9796(08)00210-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcmd.2008.10.005 [doi]']",20081120,,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the aberrations seem to be mutually exclusive in this leukemia, inactivation of the former gene leads to worse prognosis. We tested the in vitro sensitivity of the CLL samples with heterozygous ATM deletion to fludarabine and combination of fludarabine and rituximab; the responses were compared with the TP53-abnormal and wild-type (wt) cells to delimitate relative significance of ATM deletion. METHODS: In vitro analysis was performed on fifty-nine characterized CLL samples using viability assay WST-1. Western blot and real-time RT-PCR were used to monitor the activation of the ATM/p53 pathway. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: At the clinically relevant concentration of fludarabine, TP53-abnormal samples exhibited markedly higher resistance to fludarabine than the remaining CLL samples (P = 0.012); cohort with ATM deletion was not more resistant than wt cells. A similar induction of the p53 protein and its downstream target genes PUMA and BAX in ATM-deleted and wt cells confirmed that the former subgroup has preserved a critical pro-apoptotic response. Proportions of the samples, which had been sensitized to fludarabine by rituximab pretreatment, were insignificantly lower (P = 0.22) in the TP53-abnormal and ATM-deleted subgroups compared to the wt cases (30%; 29%; 50%, respectively). The presence of ATM (11q22-23) deletion in the CLL cells should not be considered an indication of resistance to fludarabine or its combination with rituximab.","['Department of Internal Medicine - Hematooncology, University Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.']","['EJH1177 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1600-0609.2008.01177.x [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The epigenetic changes of TSGs are now recognized as a mechanism contributing to the development of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). To clarify the role of DAPK1 in CML, we examined the methylation status of DAPK1 in 49 patients with CML using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The aberrant methylation of the DAPK1 gene was found in 25 of 49 (51.0%) CML cases, not in all controls. No correlation was found between DAPK1 gene methylation and the age, hematologic parameters, chromosomal abnormalities, the types and levels of bcr/abl transcripts of CML patients. However, correlation could be observed between the sex and the status of DAPK1 methylation in CML patients (R = 0.374, P = 0.008). Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between DAPK1 methylation and the stages of CML (R = 0.354, P = 0.013). The CML patients in accelerated phase (AP) and blast crisis (BC) had higher frequency of DAPK1 methylation than those in chronic phase (CP) (75.0% vs. 34.5%) (chi(2) = 7.776, P = 0.005). In one patient, the status of DAPK1 methylation became positive on the transition from CP to AP and BC.

Although the maintenance of genomic integrity by p53 is important in preventing aneuploidy, its mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here we report evidence that B-cell linker protein (BLNK) mediates the inhibition of cytokinesis, which generates tetraploidy but prevents aneuploidy. We identified BLNK as a transcriptional target of p53. Surprisingly, ectopic expression of exogenous BLNK inhibited cytokinesis, resulting in the formation of tetraploid cells. Indeed, BLNK was involved in the generation of spontaneously arising binucleate tetraploid cells. Interestingly, cytokinesis after DNA damage was inhibited in p21(-/-) and p53+/+ cells, but not in p53(-/-) cells. BLNK knockdown in p53+/+ and p21(-/-) cells enhanced cytokinesis after DNA damage, leading to the generation of aneuploid cells. In addition, a BLNK-downregulated human pre-B leukemia cell line showed increased cytokinesis and aneuploidy after DNA damage compared with two other pre-B leukemia cell lines expressing higher levels of BLNK. These results suggest that BLNK acts as a mediator of p53 in the inhibition of cytokinesis, which prevents aneuploidy. We propose that the inhibition of cytokinesis is crucial for the maintenance of genomic integrity.","['Cancer Medicine and Biophysics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']","['CAS990 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1349-7006.2008.00990.x [doi]']",20081117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous study showed skewed expression of T cell receptor beta variable region (TRBV) subfamilies and clonal expansion of T cells in leukemia patients. In the present study, in order to further characterize the T cell immunity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, the level of recent thymic emigrants (RTE) was analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative analysis of signal joint T cell recombination excision circles (deltaRec-psiJalpha sjTRECs) was performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by real-time PCR (TaqMan), and the analysis of 23 TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs was performed by semi-nested PCR. Eighty-eight cases with AML were selected for this study; ten AML cases in complete remission (AML-CR) and 38 healthy individuals served as controls. RESULTS: The levels of deltaRec-psiJalpha sjTRECs in PBMCs and CD3+ T cells were significantly decreased in AML patients, compared with healthy individuals and in patients in completive remission. Also the frequency of 23 TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs, and the number of detectable TRBV subfamily sjTRECs were significantly lower in AML patients than in healthy individuals. Moreover, the sjTRECs numbers and the frequency of TRBV-BD1 sjTRECs showed a progressive linear decline with age in AML patients. CONCLUSIONS: The decreased numbers of universal (deltaRec-psiJalpha) and family-specific (TRBV-BD1) sjTRECs indicate that the severe T cell immunodeficiency in AML patients is associated with reduced levels of recent thymic emigrants. In patients achieving complete remission both sjTREC counts return to normal values indicating the recovery of thymic function. Better understanding of the mechanisms underlying persistent immunodeficiency in leukemia patients may lead to novel treatment strategies to enhance immune competence.","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, 510632 Guangzhou, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0621-3 [doi]'],20081119,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-6 is implicated in the inflammation, which contributes to both injury and repair process after cerebral ischemia. However, IL-6 is one of the neurotrophic cytokines sharing a common receptor subunit, gp130, with other neurotrophic cytokines, such as leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and ciliary neurotrophic factor. The expression of IL-6 is most prominently identified in neurons in the peri-ischemic regions, and LIF expression shows a similar pattern. The direct injection of these cytokines into the brain after ischemia can reduce ischemic brain injury. The cytokine receptors are localized on the neuron surface, suggesting that neurons are the cytokine target. The major IL-6 downstream signaling pathway is JAK-STAT, and Stat3 activation occurs mainly in neurons during postischemic reperfusion. Further investigation is necessary to clarify the exact role of Stat3 signaling in neuroprotection. Taken together, the information suggests that IL-6 plays a double role in cerebral ischemia, as an inflammatory mediator during the acute phase and as a neurotrophic mediator between the subacute and prolonged phases.","['Department of Neurology, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan. shigeaki@sc.itc.keio.ac.jp']","['jcbfm2008141 [pii]', '10.1038/jcbfm.2008.141 [doi]']",20081119,,,,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2008 Nov 19.,,10.1159/000174951 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological emergency which presents with symptoms of confusion, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Cancer patients are at high risk of this acute encephalopathy due to chronic malnutrition, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, and consumption of thiamine by rapidly growing tumors. A high index of suspicion is important as these critically ill patients may not present with the classic triad of symptoms. METHODS: This study is a retrospective review of 5 patients with WE identified at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex., USA. Detailed clinical histories, risk factors, imaging, and histopathological characteristics are described. RESULTS: Five WE patients were identified and all patients had rapidly growing cancers and were undergoing active treatment. All patients had poor nutritional status due to chronic nausea from chemotherapy. Three patients received bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Acute confusion was the most common symptom. Magnetic resonance imaging studies of the brain revealed restricted diffusion and fluid attenuation inversion recovery sequence hyperintensity in the medial thalami and periaqueductal gray matter. In 2 cases, WE was considered antemortem, and only 1 was empirically treated with thiamine, which rapidly reversed the imaging findings within 7 days and led to clinical improvement. Other cases were diagnosed at autopsy. CONCLUSION: It is crucial to consider WE in the differential diagnosis for all cancer patients with confusion. Cancer patients with malnutrition and patients with BMT are at high risk of developing WE. To prevent this devastating and often fatal neurologic complication, all cancer patients with confusion should be empirically treated with thiamine.","['Department of Neurology, Baylor College of Medicine, USA.']","['000174951 [pii]', '10.1159/000174951 [doi]']",20081119,['K08 NS083738/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Canonical TGF-beta signaling is mediated by Smad proteins, which transduce the TGF-beta signal from the cell surface into the nucleus to regulate transcription. Upon TGF-beta binding and receptor activation, the TGF-beta receptor phosphorylates Smad2 and Smad3. SARA (Smad anchor for receptor activation) and cPML (cytoplasmic promyelocytic leukemia protein) recruit Smad2 and Smad3 for phosphorylation by the TGF-beta receptor. cPML is sequestered in the nucleus by the homeodomain protein TGIF (TG-interacting factor), a negative regulator of TGF-beta signaling. Recently, PCTA (PML competitor for TGIF association) has been shown to compete with cPML for binding to TGIF, resulting in the accumulation of cPML in the cytoplasm, where it mediates the interaction between Smad2/3 and SARA and coordinates the phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 by the TGF-beta receptor. Accordingly, PCTA promotes TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional regulation and growth inhibition. Thus, PCTA defines a new regulator in TGF-beta signaling.","['Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, 679 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA. fangliu@cabm.rutgers.edu']","['scisignal.146pe49 [pii]', '10.1126/scisignal.146pe49 [doi]']",20081118,,,,,35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon, called antigenic modulation, can compromise mAb-based therapies. Recently we reported that rituximab (RTX) treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients induced substantial loss of targeted CD20 on B cells found in the circulation after RTX infusion; this ""shaving"" of RTX-CD20 complexes from B cells is also promoted in vitro by THP-1 monocytes and by PBMC in a reaction mediated by Fcgamma receptors. The mechanism responsible for shaving appears to be trogocytosis, a process in which receptors on effector cells remove and internalize cognate ligands and cell membrane fragments from target cells. We now report that three therapeutic mAbs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cancer, RTX, cetuximab, and trastuzumab, as well as mAb T101, which has been shown to induce antigenic modulation in the clinic, promote trogocytosis in vitro upon binding to their respective target cells. Trogocytosis of the mAb-opsonized cells is mediated by THP-1 monocytes and by primary monocytes isolated from PBMC. In view of these results, it is likely that these mAbs and possibly other anticancer mAbs now used in the clinic may promote trogocytic removal of the therapeutic mAbs and their cognate Ags from tumor cells in vivo. Our findings may have important implications with respect to the use of mAbs in cancer immunotherapy.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA 22908, USA.']","['181/11/8120 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.11.8120 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE SUMMARY: A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with Bcr-abl(+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and treatment was initiated with chemotherapy and imatinib 800 mg daily. Following imatinib initiation, a gradual decrease in serum sodium level was noticed. Prolonged aplasia and neutropenic fever prompted discontinuation of therapy for 4 weeks. Following the patient's recovery, complete remission was achieved and monotherapy with imatinib 800 mg daily was restarted; however, hyponatremia recurred a few days later. The clinical findings and laboratory workup were compatible with the diagnosis of SIADH, which was attributed to high-dose imatinib. Fluid restriction and imatinib dosage reduction (to 600 mg/day) restored sodium levels. According to the Naranjo probability scale, this adverse reaction was probably associated with imatinib. DISCUSSION: Imatinib emerged as the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor to enter everyday clinical practice for the treatment of Ph(+) leukemias. Due to its molecular specificity, imatinib lacks the broad cytotoxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Inhibition of kinases in normal tissues accounts for many of imatinib's adverse reactions. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of imatinib-induced SIADH. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend monitoring for SIADH if a patient receiving high-dose imatinib develops hyponatremia.","['Department of Hematology and Lymphoma, Evangelismos Hospital, Athens, Greece. kosliapis@hotmail.com']","['aph.1L410 [pii]', '10.1345/aph.1L410 [doi]']",20081118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More important, these trials have significantly contributed to the reduction of disease recurrence as much as to the reduction of acute and late side effects. Some problems that are related to the specificity of the parameters used for risk assessment were not overcome: high tumour load by white blood cell count (WBC), age and (rare) cytogenetic subtypes (e.g. t9;22) may characterise a significant proportion of children and adolescents with high-risk ALL. Most patients who will eventually relapse do not present with characteristic features at initial diagnosis. It appears feasible through careful response assessment to identify these patients at risk of relapse, who present initially without specific features. Earlier trials of the ALL-BFM (Berlin/Frankfurt/Munster) study group and others have demonstrated that inadequate leukaemic blast reduction in the peripheral blood or bone marrow after the first few days of therapy is highly predictive of treatment failure. Using clone-specific polymerase chain reaction-based detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) as done in trial AIEOP-BFM ALL 2000 allowed a close surveillance of specific treatment elements when applied in MRD positive patients. This may facilitate innovative chemotherapy approaches and a more rational use of allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation. In addition, genetic signatures of treatment response or failure have been identified.","['Department of General Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, 24105 Kiel, Germany. m.schrappe@pediatrics.uni-kiel.de']","['ncn289 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn289 [doi]']",20081118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Positive associations between HL and occupational exposure to triazole fungicides and urea herbicides were observed (OR = 8.4 (2.2 to 32.4), 10.8 (2.4 to 48.1), respectively). Exposure to insecticides, fungicides and herbicides were linked to a threefold increase in MM risk (OR = 2.8 (1.2 to 6.5), 3.2 (1.4 to 7.2), 2.9 (1.3 to 6.5)). For LPS subtypes, associations restricted to hairy-cell leukaemia (HCL) were evidenced for exposure to organochlorine insecticides, phenoxy herbicides and triazine herbicides (OR = 4.9 (1.1 to 21.2), 4.1 (1.1 to 15.5), 5.1 (1.4 to 19.3)), although based on small numbers. Lastly, despite the increased ORs for organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, carbamate fungicides and triazine herbicides, no significant associations were evidenced for NHL. CONCLUSIONS: The results, based on case-by-case expert review of occupation-specific questionnaires, support the hypothesis that occupational pesticide exposures may be involved in HL, MM and HCL and do not rule out a role in NHL. The analyses identified specific pesticides that deserve further investigation and the findings were consistent with those of previous studies.","['Inserm U, Villejuif, France. laurent.orsi@inserm.fr']","['oem.2008.040972 [pii]', '10.1136/oem.2008.040972 [doi]']",20081118,,PMC2728754,['HALMS342613'],,,,,,['NLM: HALMS342613'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy were complicated by bilateral, posterior leukoencephalopathy and later an acquired frontal cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM). Detailed electro-clinical and imaging studies showed multiple, frontal lobe seizures per day with less frequent and non-debilitating, simple, occipital lobe seizures. Focal resection of the frontal CCM abolished the socially-disabling seizures with resultant marked improvement in the patient's quality of life at 12 months. Careful analysis of the type and impact of focal seizures in the setting of multifocal epilepsy may demonstrate that one seizure type is more deleterious to quality of life and may be amenable to surgery. In this situation, the patient may benefit significantly from surgery to resect the more active epileptic focus.","['Epilepsy Research Centre and Department of Medicine, The University of Melbourne.']","['epd.2008.0221 [pii]', '10.1684/epd.2008.0221 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several studies have revealed the functions of miR-223 in granulopoiesis. Here we analysed miR-223 expression in various human tissues, blood and leukaemia cells, and focused on its role in K562 erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. MiR-223 was detected not only in granulocytes but also in erythroid cells. In K562 cells, expression of miR-223 was down-regulated during haemin-induced erythroid differentiation but up-regulated during phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-induced megakaryocytic differentiation. The overexpression of miR-223 resulted in significant decrease of gamma-globin mRNA and the fraction of benzidine-positive cells in K562 cells, suggesting a suppressive effect of miR-223 on erythroid differentiation. Peaks corresponding to 4N cells in stable transfectants overexpressing miR-223 were higher than that in control K562 cells during megakaryocytic differentiation, indicating that miR-223 increases megakaryocytic differentiation. The expression of LIM domain only 2 (LMO2) reporter was suppressed in NIH-3T3 when the expression of miR-223 was enforced by both the luciferase and fluorescence system. Furthermore, LMO2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly decreased in stable K562 transfectants overexpressing miR-223. These results indicate that LMO2 is a direct target of miR-223. Thus, our results suggest that miR-223 reversibly regulates erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells via down-modulation of LMO2.","[""National Laboratory of Medical Molecular Biology, Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, 5 Dong Dan San Tiao, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]","['JCMM585 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1582-4934.2008.00585.x [doi]']",,,PMC4515070,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RUNX1-EVI1 has oncogenic potentials through dominant-negative effect over wild-type RUNX1, inhibition of Jun kinase (JNK) pathway, stimulation of cell growth via AP-1, suppression of TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition and repression of C/EBPalpha. Runx1-EVI1 heterozygous knock-in mice die in uteri due to central nervous system (CNS) hemorrhage and severe defects in definitive hematopoiesis as Runx1-/- mice do, indicating that RUNX1-EVI1 dominantly suppresses functions of wild-type RUNX1 in vivo. Acute myelogenous leukemia is induced in mice transplanted with bone marrow cells expressing RUNX1-EVI1, and a Runx1-EVI1 knock-in chimera mouse developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. These results suggest that RUNX1-EVI1 plays indispensable roles in leukemogenesis of t(3;21)-positive leukemia.

Patients were scored 0-100 within each of 15 domains. A difference between groups of > or = 10 points was deemed clinically significant (asterisked * below). 431 valid baseline questionnaires were returned. Compared with population norms, patients had impaired HRQoL in 13/15 domains. The greatest differences were in fatigue*, sleep disturbance*, role functioning and global HRQoL. Fatigue was reported by 81% of patients, compared with the next most common symptoms: sleep disturbance (56%) and dyspnoea (49%). There was no association between spleen, liver or lymph node enlargement, or lymphocytosis and any HRQoL domain. Older age (> or =70 years) was associated with poorer physical functioning (P < 0.001) but fewer financial difficulties (P < 0.001*). Impairment of HRQoL at baseline was most apparent in stage A-progressive patients with B-symptoms and stage C patients with haemoglobin <120 g/l: compared with all others, these patients had poorer physical, role and social functioning, more fatigue and dyspnoea and poorer global HRQoL (all P < or = 0.001*). These findings support the recommendation to begin treatment when patients experience symptomatic disease, to improve HRQoL.","['Section of Haemato-Oncology, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']","['BJH7407 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07407.x [doi]']",20081018,['MC_U137686856/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigated in vitro endothelial effects of coculture of microvascular endothelial cells (MVEC) with AML cells derived from 33 consecutive AML patients. A proliferation assay showed that (i) AML cells from the majority of patients examined increased endothelial cell proliferation, while cytokine neutralizing experiments had divergent effects on proliferation and (ii) the angiopoietin/Tie2 system was important for growth of AML cells, and angiopoietin-1 induced phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins in AML cells. Finally, gene expression profiling of MVEC cocultured with AML cells was conducted in non-contact cultures. Microarray analysis revealed that the majority of significantly expressed genes could be categorized into gene ontology terms involved in transcription, cellular organization and intracellular signalling. Our study indicates a role for the leukaemic-endothelium crosstalk in leukaemogenesis with enhancement of endothelial cell growth and increased AML cell proliferation possibly mediated by angiopoietin-1 and the STAT signalling pathway.","['Section for Haematology, Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Norway.']","['BJH7411 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07411.x [doi]']",20081030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study demonstrated that dasatinib inhibited proliferation of Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was associated with the decreased production of corresponding cytokines. Treatment of Tregs with dasatinib inhibited the suppressive capacity of Tregs. The mechanisms of this inhibition included arrest of cells in the G0/G1 phase of cell cycle, down-regulation of the transcription factor forkhead box P3, glucocorticoid-induced tumour necrosis factor receptor and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein 4 as well as inhibition of signaling events through Src and nuclear factor kappaB. Dasatinib showed an inhibitory effect on the proliferation and function of both Tregs and CD4+CD25- T cells at therapeutically relevant concentrations of the drug. Clinical administration of dasatinib might influence not only the graft-versus-leukaemia effect but also the graft-versus-host-disease in patients receiving dasatinib after allogeneic stem cell transplantation and/or donor lymphocytes infusion as the function of both Tregs and effector T cells are hampered in a similar way by dasatinib.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']","['BJH7433 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07433.x [doi]']",20081107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bortezomib generally showed dose-response curves with a steep slope. In patient cells, bortezomib was more active in haematological than in solid tumour samples. Myeloma and chronic myeloid leukaemia were the most sensitive tumour types although with great variability in drug response between the individual samples. Colorectal and kidney cancer samples were the least sensitive. In the cell-line panel, only small differences in response were seen between the different cell lines, and the proteasome inhibitors, lactacystin and MG 262, showed an activity pattern similar to that of bortezomib.

However, there is significant disparity in the reported incidences of development of periodontal infections. Evidence is limited to those showing the systemic influence of periodontal infection in neutropenic patients. This study indicated an association between febrile neutropenia (FN) and periodontitis in a case in which periodontal treatment in the intervals between chemotherapy cycles reduced FN in subsequent courses of chemotherapy and hematopoietic transplantation (HCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Periodontal treatment was performed in a 61-year-old man with advanced periodontitis, who received HCT following three cycles of chemotherapy. After recovery from neutropenia induced by initial chemotherapy, periodontal treatment was performed in each chemotherapy interval period. Following extraction of teeth with severe advanced periodontitis, all teeth were subjected to periodontal pocket curettage and root planning, which are common periodontal treatments to reduce periodontal pockets harboring anaerobic periodontal bacteria, before HCT. MAIN RESULTS: Periodontal treatment successfully reduced periodontal pockets from 4.1 +/- 1.5 mm to 3.0 +/- 0.6 mm, which was almost within the healthy range (<3.0 mm), before HCT. The frequency of FN decreased significantly with increasing cycles of chemotherapy, and decreases in FN corresponded to progress of periodontal treatment. Blood cultures obtained a total of 12 times throughout leukemia treatment were all negative. CONCLUSIONS: The observations reported here indicate the importance of periodontal treatment in clinical management of patients undergoing leukemia treatment to prevent FN, although all blood cultures were negative.","['Department of Pathophysiology-Periodontal Science, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2-5-1 Shikata-cho, Okayama 700-8525, Japan.']",['10.1007/s00520-008-0532-z [doi]'],20081118,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are minimal data regarding which lymphocyte parameter (absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] or B-cell count) and what threshold should be used for diagnosis. We analyzed the relationship of ALC and B-cell count with clinical outcome in 459 patients with a clonal population of CLL phenotype to determine (1) whether the CLL diagnosis should be based on ALC or B-cell count, (2) what lymphocyte threshold should be used for diagnosis, and (3) whether any lymphocyte count has independent prognostic value after accounting for biologic/molecular prognostic markers. B-cell count and ALC had similar value for predicting treatment-free survival (TFS) and overall survival as continuous variables, but as binary factors, a B-cell threshold of 11 x 10(9)/L best predicted survival. B-cell count remained an independent predictor of TFS after controlling for ZAP-70, IGHV, CD38, or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results (all P < .001). These analyses support basing the diagnosis of CLL on B-cell count and retaining the size of the B-cell count in the diagnostic criteria. Using clinically relevant criteria to distinguish between monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) and CLL could minimize patient distress caused by labeling asymptomatic people at low risk for adverse clinical consequences as having CLL.","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu']","['S0006-4971(20)39228-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-09-176149 [doi]']",20081117,"['K23 CA113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA136591/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 113408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2676080,,['Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4130-1.

These efforts are leading to the steady identification of multi-potent, self-renewing and proliferative progenitor cell populations throughout the bronchopulmonary tree. These cells give rise to both transiently amplifying (TA) and terminally differentiated (TD) cells, which (like in many other organs) are crucial for tissue homeostasis. In leukemia, it has been shown that partially committed cells, which are normally responsible for tissue maintenance after trauma, may undergo transformation via mutations resulting in the selective expression of genes that accentuate and perpetuate these cells' self-renewal capabilities.

M-CSF stimulated maturation of the NFS60 cell line was associated with enhanced THOC5 expression and phosphorylation. THOC5 was also shown to form a complex with C/EBPbeta. Ectopic expression of THOC5 mimicked M-CSF mediated cell maturation and enhanced protein expression of the myeloid transcription factors C/EBPbeta, C/EBPalpha, Pu-1 and also GAB2 (a PI-3 Kinase and macrophage development regulator). Increased THOC5 expression also mimicked M-CSF stimulated increases in the lipid second messenger PtdInsP(3). Inhibition of THOC5-induced increases in PtdInsP(3) levels abrogated the elevated levels of C/EBPbeta. Thus THOC5 expression can potentiate receptor signalling to transcription factor expression and monocyte differentiation.","['Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics laboratory, Faculty of Medical and Human Sciences, University of Manchester, Christie Hospital, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 9BX, UK.']","['S0898-6568(08)00329-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2008.10.018 [doi]']",20081105,['Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we describe how a novel non-toxic G1-arresting compound, pyrrolo-1,5-benzoxazepine (PBOX)-21, potentiates the apoptotic ability of STI571 in Bcr-Abl-positive CML cells. Co-treatment of CML cells with PBOX-21 and STI571 induced more apoptosis than either drug alone in parental (K562S and LAMA84) and STI571-resistant cells lines (K562R). This potentiation of apoptosis was specific to Bcr-Abl-positive leukaemia cells with no effect observed on Bcr-Abl-negative HL-60 acute myeloid leukaemia cells. Apoptosis induced by PBOX-21/STI571 resulted in activation of caspase-8, cleavage of PARP and Bcl-2, upregulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim and a downregulation of Bcr-Abl. Repression of proteins involved in Bcr-Abl transformation, the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-(XL) was also observed. The combined lack of an early change in mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and cleavage of pro-caspase-9 suggests that this pathway is not involved in the initiation of apoptosis by PBOX-21/STI571. Apoptosis was significantly reduced following pre-treatment with either the general caspase inhibitor Boc-FMK or the chymotrypsin-like serine protease inhibitor TPCK, but was completely abrogated following pre-treatment with a combination of these inhibitors. This demonstrates the important role for each of these protease families in this apoptotic pathway. In conclusion, our data highlights the potential of PBOX-21 in combination with STI571 as an effective therapy against CML.","['School of Biochemistry and Immunology, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. brights@tcd.ie']","['S0006-2952(08)00713-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.10.008 [doi]']",20081030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hsp90 is therefore an interesting therapeutic target for cancer therapy. In this paper, we investigated whether an oxidative stress generated during ascorbate-driven menadione redox cycling (ascorbate/menadione), affects Hsp90 leading to the degradation of some critical proteins and cell death. Unlike 17-AAG, which inhibits Hsp90 but enhances Hsp70 levels, ascorbate/menadione-treated cells present an additional Hsp90 protein band of about 70kDa as shown by Western blot analysis, suggesting Hsp90 cleavage. This Hsp90 cleavage seems to be a selective phenomenon since it was observed in a large panel of cancer cell lines but not in non-transformed cells. Antibodies raised against either the N-terminus or the C-terminus domains of Hsp90 suggest that the site of cleavage should be located at its N-terminal part. Furthermore, antibodies raised against either the alpha- or the beta-Hsp90 isoform show that Hsp90beta is cleaved while the alpha isoform is down-regulated. We have further shown that different Hsp90 client proteins like Bcr-Abl (a chimerical protein expressed in K562 leukemia cells), RIP and Akt, were degraded when K562 cells were exposed to an oxidative stress. Both Hsp90 cleavage and Bcr-Abl degradation were observed by incubating K562 cells with another H(2)O(2)-generating system (glucose/glucose oxidase) and by incubating KU812 cells (another leukemia cell line) with ascorbate/menadione. Due to the major role of Hsp90 in stabilizing oncogenic and mutated proteins, these results may have potential clinical applications.","['Unite de Pharmacocinetique, Metabolisme, Nutrition, et Toxicologie, Departement des sciences pharmaceutiques, Universite Catholique de Louvain, avenue E.

Because type II topoisomerases (Topo II) are ATP-dependent, we infer that 8-Cl-Ado exposure might interfere with Topo II activities and DNA metabolism in cells. We found that 8-Cl-Ado exposure inhibited Topo II-catalytic activities in K562 cells, as revealed by decreased relaxation of the supercoiled pUC19 DNA and inhibited decatenation of the kinetoplast DNA (kDNA). In vitro assays showed that 8-Cl-ATP, but not 8-Cl-Ado, could directly inhibit Topo IIalpha-catalyzed relaxation and decatenation of substrate DNA. Furthermore, 8-Cl-ATP inhibited Topo II-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis and increased salt-stabilized closed clamp. In addition, 8-Cl-Ado exposure decreased bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation into DNA and led to enhanced DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) and to increased formation of gamma-H2AX nuclear foci in exposed K562 cells. Together, 8-Cl-Ado/8-Cl-ATP can inhibit Topo II activities in cells, thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis and inducing DNA DSBs, which may contribute to 8-Cl-Ado-inhibited proliferation of cancers.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Peking University Health Science Center, Xue Yuan Road 38, Beijing 100083, PR China.']","['S0006-2952(08)00775-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.bcp.2008.10.022 [doi]']",20081028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both the compounds exhibited dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on human leukemic cell lines, K562, Reh, CEM and 8E5. Incorporation of tritiated thymidine ([(3)H] thymidine) in conjunction with cell cycle analysis suggested that DFH and DCH inhibited the growth of leukemic cells. Downregulation of PCNA and p-histone H3 further confirm that the growth inhibition could be at the level of DNA replication. Flow cytometric analysis indicated the accumulation of cells at subG1 phase suggesting induction of apoptosis, which was further confirmed and quantified both by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and confocal microscopy following annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining. Mechanistically, our data support the induction of apoptosis by activation of the mitochondrial pathway. Results supporting such a model include, elevated levels of p53, and BAD, decreased level of BCL2, activation and cleavage of caspase 9, activation of procaspase 3, poly (ADP-ribosyl) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, downregulation of Ku70, Ku80 and DNA fragmentation.

Mutations in SBDS have been shown to cause SDS, but the function of the SBDS gene product is unclear. Accelerated angiogenesis has recently been described in bone marrow cells from SDS patients. To clarify the unknown function of SBDS, we performed experiments analyzing the cellular effects of depleting SBDS by RNA interference. The growth of HeLa cells constitutively depleted of SBDS was markedly hindered when compared to cells stably transfected with siRNA against an irrelevant control gene. Similarly, growth of HeLa cells induced to express siRNA against SBDS was specifically inhibited. Inducible SBDS knockdown was associated with modestly increased levels of apoptosis, suggesting a partial contribution of this process to growth inhibition. By microarray analysis of knockdown cells, we found marked differences in expression of genes in multiple pathways, and we chose to examine a selected subset more closely using quantitative PCR arrays. In constitutive and inducible SBDS-depleted HeLa cell clones, we found 3- to 6-fold elevated mRNA levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG or TNFRSF11B) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). We confirmed significant overexpression of both secreted proteins by ELISA from supernatants of SBDS-depleted HeLa cells.

Transformation of infected cells involves HTLV-1's oncoprotein Tax, which perturbs cell cycle regulation and modulates cellular gene expression. The latter function is also a hallmark of microRNAs, a rather new layer in the regulation of gene expression. Affecting e.g. proliferation, microRNAs constitute a potential target for viral interference on the way to persistence and transformation. Hence, we explored the interconnections between HTLV-1 and cellular microRNAs. RESULTS: We report that several microRNAs--miRs 21, 24, 146a, 155 and 223--are deregulated in HTLV-1-transformed cells. They are all upregulated except for miR-223, which is downregulated. Each of those microRNAs has ties to cancer. Their expression pattern forms a uniform phenotype among HTLV-transformed cells when compared to HTLV-negative control cells. In particular, miR-146a expression was found to be directly stimulated by Tax via NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation of its promoter; a single NF-kappaB site proximal to the transcription start point was necessary and sufficient for this to happen. An in silico analysis of potential target genes revealed candidates that might be coregulated by two or more of the aforementioned overexpressed microRNAs. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that cellular microRNAs are deregulated in HTLV-1-transformed T cells. In the case of miR-146a, this could be directly attributed to HTLV's oncoprotein Tax. Interference with cellular microRNAs may be crucial to maintaining persistence or may facilitate transformation of host cells.","['Institute of Clinical and Molecular Virology, University Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schlossgarten 4, Erlangen, Germany. klemens.pichler@viro.med.uni-erlangen.de']","['1742-4690-5-100 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-100 [doi]']",20081112,,PMC2628945,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is attributable to the low (minimal) number of active mitochondria and the consequently slow utilization of O2 entering the cell. This results in an increased intracellular partial pressure of O2 (pO2) and increased levels of reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen (RNS) species, and a Delta(PO - AO) imbalance between the pro-oxidative (PO) and antioxidative (AO) constituents. PROPOSED MECHANISM: Because excessive O2 is toxic, we suggest that hematopoietic cells exist in a kind of unstable dynamic balance. This suggestion is based on the idea that mitochondria not only consume O2 in the process of ATP production but also constitute the main anti-oxygenic stage in the cell's protective antioxidative system. Variations in the mitochondrial base capacity (quantity and quality of mitochondria) constitute an important and highly efficient channel for regulating the oxidative stress level within a cell.The primary target for leukemogenic agents is the few mitochondria within the hematopoietic stem cell. Disturbance and weakening of their respiratory function further enhances the initial pro-oxidative state of the cell. This readily results in peroxygenation stress, creating the necessary condition for inducing leukemogenesis. We propose that this is the main cause of all related genetic and other disorders in the cell. ROS, RNS and peroxides act as signal molecules affecting redox-sensitive transcription factors, enzymes, oncogenes and other effectors. Thereby, they influence the expression and suppression of many genes, as well as the course and direction of proliferation, differentiation, leukemogenesis and apoptosis.Differentiation of leukemic cells is blocked at the precursor stage. While the transformation of non-hematopoietic cells into tumor cells starts during proliferation, hematopoietic cells become leukemic at one of the interim stages in differentiation, and differentiation does not continue beyond that point. Proliferation is switched to differentiation and back according to a trigger principle, again involving ROS and RNS. When the leukemogenic DeltaL(PO - AO) imbalance decreases in an under-differentiated leukemia cell to the differentiation level DeltaD(PO - AO), the cell may continue to differentiate to the terminal stage. CONCLUSION: The argument described in this article is used to explain the causes of congenital and children's leukemia, and the induction of leukemia by certain agents (vitamin K3, benzene, etc.). Specific research is required to validate the proposals made in this article. This will require accurate and accessible methods for measuring and assessing oxidative stress in different types of cells in general, and in hematopoietic cells in particular, in their different functional states.","['Scientific Center for Anti-Infectious Drugs, Almaty, Kazakhstan. mlyu@mail.ru']","['1742-4682-5-23 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4682-5-23 [doi]']",20081111,,PMC2614412,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further analyse heterogeneously methylated sequences, we adopted a digital approach to MS-HRM (dMS-HRM) that involves the amplification of single templates after limiting dilution to quantify and to determine the degree of methylation. We used this approach to study methylation of the CDKN2B (p15) cell cycle progression inhibitor gene which is inactivated by DNA methylation in haematological malignancies of the myeloid lineage. Its promoter region usually shows heterogeneous methylation and is only rarely fully methylated. The methylation status of CDKN2B can be used as a biomarker of response to treatment. Therefore the accurate characterisation of its methylation is desirable. RESULTS: MS-HRM was used to assess CDKN2B methylation in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) samples. All the AML samples that were methylated at the CDKN2B promoter (40/93) showed varying degrees of heterogeneous methylation. Six representative samples were selected for further study. dMS-HRM was used to simultaneously count the methylated alleles and assess the degree of methylation. Direct sequencing of selected dMS-HRM products was used to determine the exact DNA methylation pattern and confirmed the degree of methylation estimated by dMS-HRM. CONCLUSION: dMS-HRM is a powerful technique for the analysis of methylation in CDKN2B and other heterogeneously methylated genes. It eliminates both PCR and cloning bias towards either methylated or unmethylated DNA. Potentially complex information is simplified into a digital output, allowing counting of methylated and unmethylated alleles and providing an overall picture of methylation at the given locus. Downstream sequencing is minimised as dMS-HRM acts as a screen to select only methylated clones for further analysis.","['Molecular Pathology Research and Development Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria 8006, Australia. ida.Candiloro@petermac.org']","['1756-8935-1-7 [pii]', '10.1186/1756-8935-1-7 [doi]']",20081103,,PMC2590600,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously analyzed the distribution and clonality of T-cell receptor alpha and beta variable region (TRAV) and (TRBV) of the subfamily T cell receptors in T cells from umbilical cord blood. Recent data indicated that gammadelta(+) T cells may play an important role in mediating the graft versus leukemia effect after stem cells transplantation and in anti-cancer response. In order to further characterize the repertoire of CB T-cells, the frequency of alphabeta(+) and gammadelta(+) T cells were examined in CB by FACS. The CDR3 size of 4 TRGV and 8 TRDV subfamily genes were analyzed in mononuclear cells (MCs) from 16 CB samples, using RT-PCR and genescan technique. To determine the expression level of TRGV subfamily genes, we performed quantitative analysis of TRGVI-III subfamilies by real-time PCR. Low percentage of CD3(+)TCRgammadelta(+) cells was observed in CB. The frequency of expression in TRGVI, TRGVII and TRGVIII in CBMCs was 93.75%, 81.25% and 56.25%, respectively. The mean value of the number of expressed TRDV subfamilies in CBMCs is higher than that from adult peripheral blood (PB) group. The frequently expressed members in CB were TRDV1 (100%), TRDV2 (93.75%), TRDV8 (93.75%) and TRDV3 (81.25%), respectively. The frequencies of TRDV5 and TRDV8 in CBMCs were significantly higher than those from PBMCs. Most of the PCR products of TRGV and TRDV subfamilies from 10 CB samples displayed polyclonal rearrangement pattern, whereas one or two PCR products from 6 CB samples showed oligoclonality or biclonality. In contrast, PCR products from 9 of 10 adult healthy controls contained at least an oligoclonal peak in different TRGV or TRDV subfamilies respectively. The pattern of TRGV subfamily expression level in CBMCs was TRGVI>TRGVIII>TRGVII, and in contrast, TRGVII>TRGVI>TRGVIII was found in PBMCs. In conclusion, our results indicate polyclonal and more diverse TRDV segment usage in CB gammadelta(+) T-cells. The pattern of TRGV expression levels in CB T cells was found to be quite different from the one in PB T cells. These findings are apparently the first report regarding the repression pattern of TRGV repertoire in CB. It also provides a detailed profile of the global TRGV and TRDV repertoire and TRGVI-III expression levels in cord blood T cells in Chinese subjects. The biological significance of the differences observed between CB and PB is at present obscure. However, this study will definitively contribute to understand the cellular immune features better and to exploit more efficiently the therapeutic potentials of CB.","['Institute of Hematology, Medical College, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China. yangqiuli@hotmail.com']","['S0966-3274(08)00103-2 [pii]', '10.1016/j.trim.2008.10.010 [doi]']",20081112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/EU395807'],,,,,,,

The effect of IL-3 and exogenous hydrogen peroxide on cell viability seems to be mediated through inhibition of the cell death commitment, as shown by apoptotic markers such as caspase activities, apoptotic nuclei, and changes in the amount of proteins belonging to the Bcl-2 family. The pivotal role of ROS is confirmed using various antioxidants, such as EUK-134, ebselen, TEMPO, and hydroxylamine probe. In fact, these antioxidants, acting through different mechanisms, decrease glucose transport activity and cell proliferation activated by IL-3 or by low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, antioxidants foster programmed cell death commitment, as shown by the cited apoptotic parameters. EUK-134, a combined superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, opposes the effects of IL-3 and H(2)O(2), decreasing phosphorylation levels of signaling enzymes such as Akt, Src tyrosine kinase, and ERK. Results show that ROS production induced by IL-3 can protect leukemic cells from apoptosis, the effect being counteracted by antioxidants. This mechanism may play an important role in supporting acute myeloid leukemia treatment, thus representing a novel therapeutic strategy.","['Department of Biochemistry G.

One of the partner loci maps to 20q12 and involves the MAFB gene resulting in its ectopic expression. We attempt here to identify MAFB target genes in MM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used an inducible system to upregulate MAFB in MM cell lines not carrying the t(14;20). Microarray expression analysis was used to detect gene expression changes upon MAFB expression. These genes were further evaluated comparatively with gene expression profiles obtained from MM or plasma cell leukemia tumors carrying an activated MAFB gene. Functional implications of these upregulated genes were studied by testing their promoter activity in reporter assays. C-MAF was included comparatively as well. RESULTS: The inducible cell lines identified a total of 284 modulated transcripts. After further evaluation using ex vivo data 14 common upregulated genes were found, common to the C-MAF pathway as well. The promoter activity of some of these secondary genes proved a functional relationship with MAFB. In connection with one of these secondary genes (NOTCH2), even tertiary upregulated genes were found. Functional studies indicated that inducible MAFB expression conferred antiapoptotic effects. CONCLUSION: We identified 14 upregulated genes, and their downstream consequences in the combined MAFB/C-MAF pathway. Eleven of these genes are novel in the C-MAF pathway as well. These direct target genes may be responsible for the oncogenic transformation of MAF expressing myeloma cells.","['University Medical Center Utrecht, Department of Immunology, Utrecht, The Netherlands; Hubrecht Laboratory, Center for Biomedical Genetics, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']","['S0301-472X(08)00413-X [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.08.006 [doi]']",20081113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: National policy emphasises the importance of involving children, young people and families in the planning of services they are receiving. To be responsive to real, as opposed to perceived needs, health care professionals are actively seeking ways to capture the voice of the families they care for through a process of consultation and action. DESIGN: Focus groups. METHOD: A series of focus groups were undertaken with 16 families who were either on treatment or within six months of completion of treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Tape- and note-based analysis was initially undertaken and the data sorted by means of an overview grid. Data were then analysed by the research team through comparison and agreement of final themes. RESULTS: The majority of families were satisfied with the care they received. Six themes are described that capture their combined thoughts on their overall experience; navigating the maze, communication, continuity of care, environment, waiting and organisation of care. CONCLUSIONS: Focus groups are an effective means of obtaining data from service users. Group discussion allowed for the sharing and development of ideas to be incorporated into developments within the service. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Increasingly, children, young people and their families are being cared for within Paediatric Haematology/Oncology Day Care units, it is, therefore, vital that this aspect of care is designed, co-ordinated and delivered around the needs of the family. This can only be achieved by listening to the stories of those families who use our service to confirm what it is that works well and what areas of care may need to be enhanced.","['Safari Day Care, Infection Cancer and Immunity, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UK.

Results of few epidemiologic studies conducted thus far are inconsistent, and only one has examined the association by histologic subtype. SUBJECTS: A population-based, case-control study of 387 patients with NHL and 535 controls conducted in Nebraska between 1999 and 2002. METHODS: Information on vaccination for tetanus, polio, influenza, smallpox, and tuberculosis, as well as important environmental factors, was collected by telephone interview. Risk was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: We found that NHL risk was inversely associated with ever receiving a polio (OR = 0.59, CI = 0.40-0.87) or smallpox (OR = 0.71, CI = 0.51-0.98) vaccination, and positively associated with influenza vaccination (OR = 1.53, CI = 1.14-2.06). No significant association was found for tetanus or tuberculosis vaccination. The patterns of association were similar between men and women. Analysis by histologic subtypes showed that polio vaccination was associated with a lower risk of follicular (OR = 0.54, CI = 0.31-0.92) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphomas (OR = 0.29, CI = 0.12-0.69) and smallpox vaccination was associated with a lower risk of marginal zone lymphoma (OR = 0.41, CI = 0.19-0.88). In contrast, ever receiving an influenza vaccination was associated with a higher risk of follicular (OR = 1.98, CI = 1.23-3.18) and diffuse large B cell lymphomas (OR = 1.88, CI = 1.13-3.12). CONCLUSION: Risk of NHL is inversely associated with polio and smallpox vaccination and positively associated with influenza vaccination. These associations appear to differ by histologic subtype.","['Department of Preventive Medicine, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, 680 North Lake Shore Drive, Suite 1102, Chicago, IL 60611-4402, USA.']",['10.1007/s10552-008-9259-x [doi]'],20081115,"['K23 CA109613/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA100600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3446202,['NIHMS399830'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heights were measured at three key periods, that is, transplantation, before adolescence, and FH, and compared using height standard deviation score (SDS) and cumulative change in SDS. The influence of the conditioning regimen was assessed using multiple linear regression and adjusting for gender, central nervous system irradiation, age and leukaemia status at transplant and type of transplantation. Overall mean height SDS was near normal at transplantation and before adolescence (0.2+/-0.1 and -0.2+/-0.1, respectively), but decreased to -1.6+/-0.1 at FH. There were significant differences between the TBI and BU groups when comparing FH SDS (-1.8+/-0.2 vs -0.8+/-0.2, P=0.001), mean change in height SDS from transplantation to FH (-2+/-0.1 vs -1.1+/-0.2, P=0.002) and mean change in height SDS during adolescence (-1.6+/-0.1 vs -0.7+/-0.2, P=0.003).

Therefore, we replaced CYA by sirolimus in patients with high relapse risk. In contrast to CNIs, sirolimus promotes the generation of regulatory T-cells and has potent antineoplastic activity. Sirolimus has been used in combination with CNI for GVHD prophylaxis in hematopoietic SCT. However, no CNI-free prophylactic regimen with sirolimus has been evaluated so far. Within the FLAMSA-RIC protocol, 15 patients received GVHD prophylaxis with sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The underlying diagnoses were relapsed or refractory T-ALL (n=3), AML with FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) or mixed-lineage leukemia-partial tandem duplication (MLL-PTD; n=10; 5 with refractory disease) and CML in refractory myeloid blast crisis (n=2). All evaluable patients (n=14) were engrafted. Grades II-IV acute GVHD occurred in 21% and chronic GVHD in 30% of patients. Non-relapse mortality rate was 14%. No thrombotic microangiopathy or sinusoidal obstruction syndrome was observed. Three patients with FLT3-ITD+ AML relapsed after a median of 112 days.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Measurements were performed at diagnosis, after the induction-consolidation phase and at standard time points before each cycle in 9 patients with ALL aged 2 to 7 years (median 4.3 y). Body mass index (BMI) and leukemic burden were estimated at the same time points and correlated with PYY and ghrelin levels. Nine healthy children matched for age and sex were used as controls. RESULTS: At diagnosis, mean PYY levels were high (P<0.0001) and mean active ghrelin were low, compared with controls (P<0.001). Compared with baseline values, PYY increased significantly after the induction-consolidation phase (P=0.033), and returned progressively to pretreatment levels after the sixth cycle, whereas ghrelin fluctuated and stabilized at significantly higher levels (P=0.024) after the eighth cycle of chemotherapy. However, ghrelin was still low, compared with controls (P<0.001), after the eighth cycle. Delta (final-baseline) mean PYY was negatively correlated with delta mean BMI SD score (-0.612, P=0.010) and positively with leukemic burden (0.529, P=0.015), whereas delta mean ghrelin was positively correlated with delta mean BMI SD score (0.626, P=0.009) and negatively with leukemic burden (-0.567, P=0.012).

The function of CBP is critical for proper embryonic development and is relevant in cancer biology. Although much is known about the functional roles of CBP in these cellular processes, fewer studies have assessed what in turn regulates CBP activity per se. It has been reported that CBP colocalizes with PML bodies which are nuclear structures disrupted in acute promyelocytic leukemia. However, the biological relevance of CBP localization to PML nuclear bodies is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors such as valproic acid, a therapeutically relevant compound used for the treatment of epilepsy, modulates CBP activity. Valproic acid reduces the steady-state level of CBP by inducing CBP degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, while increasing the colocalization of CBP with ubiquitin nuclear speckles and with PML nuclear bodies. Our results suggest that PML nuclear bodies are nuclear sites involved in the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of CBP, providing novel insights in the regulation of CBP function and highlighting the relevance of its localization to PML nuclear bodies.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']","['7203 [pii]', '10.4161/epi.3.6.7203 [doi]']",20081115,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, 42% of patients were intolerant to imatinib therapy through 2 years, and progression-free survival was 86%. In conclusion, an adjusted dose exerting minimal toxicity and showing a favorable outcome should be researched in Japanese patients including the elderly.","['Division of Hematology, Dept. of Internal Medicine, Kagawa University.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, the SCL complex is present at all activating GATA elements in megakaryocytes and mast cells. In striking contrast, at sites where GATA-1 functions as a repressor, the SCL complex is depleted. A DNA-binding defective form of SCL maintains association with a subset of active GATA elements indicating that GATA-1 is a key determinant for SCL recruitment. Knockdown of LMO2 selectively impairs activation but not repression by GATA-1. ETO-2, an SCL-associated protein with the potential for transcription repression, is also absent from GATA-1-repressed genes but, unlike SCL, fails to accumulate at GATA-1-activated genes.

Although the results of such studies are useful to generate hypotheses, they must be interpreted with caution, as the data were aggregated and analysed for geographical areas and not for individuals. The seven available case-control studies of childhood leukaemia with measurement of radon concentrations in the residences of cases and controls gave mixed results, however, with some indication of a weak (relative risk < 2) association with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The epidemiological evidence to date suggests that an association between indoor exposure to radon and childhood leukaemia might exist, but is weak. More case-control studies are needed, with sufficient statistical power to detect weak associations and based on designs and methods that minimise misclassification of exposure and provide a high participation rate and low potential selection bias.","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen O, Denmark. ole@cancer.dk']","['ncn288 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn288 [doi]']",20081114,,,,,25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for using such a combination is that perifosine was recently described to increase TRAIL-R2 receptor expression and decrease the cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (cFLIP) in human lung cancer cell lines. Perifosine and TRAIL both induced cell death by apoptosis in the THP-1 AML cell line, which is characterized by constitutive PI3K/Akt activation, but lacks functional p53. Perifosine, at concentrations below IC(50), dephosphorylated Akt and increased TRAIL-R2 levels, as shown by Western blot, reverse transcription-PCR, and flow cytometric analysis. Perifosine also decreased the long isoform of cFLIP (cFLIP-L) and the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) expression. Perifosine and TRAIL synergized to activate caspase-8 and induce apoptosis, which was blocked by a caspase-8-selective inhibitor. Up-regulation of TRAIL-R2 expression was dependent on a protein kinase Calpha/c-Jun-NH(2)-kinase 2/c-Jun signaling pathway activated by perifosine through reactive oxygen species production. Perifosine also synergized with TRAIL in primary AML cells displaying constitutive activation of the Akt pathway by inducing apoptosis, Akt dephosphorylation, TRAIL-R2 up-regulation, cFLIP-L and XIAP down-regulation, and c-Jun phosphorylation. The combined treatment negatively affected the clonogenic activity of CD34(+) cells from patients with AML. In contrast, CD34(+) cells from healthy donors were resistant to perifosine and TRAIL treatment. Our findings suggest that the combination of perifosine and TRAIL might offer a novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Servizio di Immunoematologia e Trasfusionale, Policlinico S.

Here, we report that p53-inducible ribonucleotide reductase (p53R2/RRM2B) is a robust transcriptional target of decitabine. In cancer cells, decitabine treatment induces p53R2 mRNA expression, protein expression, and promoter activity in a p53-dependent manner. The mechanism of p53R2 gene induction by decitabine does not seem to be promoter DNA hypomethylation, as the p53R2 5' CpG island is hypomethylated before treatment. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) in wild-type p53 cells leads to genomic DNA hypomethylation but does not induce p53R2, suggesting that DNMT/DNA adduct formation is the molecular trigger for p53R2 induction. Consistent with this idea, only nucleoside-based DNMT inhibitors that form covalent DNA adducts induce p53R2 expression. siRNA targeting of p53R2 reduces the extent of cell cycle arrest following decitabine treatment, supporting a functional role for p53R2 in decitabine-mediated cellular responses. To determine the clinical relevance of p53R2 induction, we measured p53R2 expression in bone marrow samples from 15 myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia (MDS/AML) patients undergoing decitabine therapy. p53R2 mRNA and protein were induced in 7 of 13 (54%) and 6 of 9 (67%) patients analyzed, respectively, despite a lack of methylation changes in the p53R2 promoter. Most notably, there was a significant association (P = 0.0047) between p53R2 mRNA induction and clinical response in MDS/AML. These data establish p53R2 as a novel hypomethylation-independent decitabine gene target associated with clinical response.","['Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']","['68/22/9358 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1860 [doi]']",,"['R01 CA116674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116674-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11674/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116674-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA073992/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA73992/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2606040,['NIHMS70972'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with newly diagnosed AML were treated with dexamethasone, choline magnesium trisalicylate, or both for 24 hours prior to and 24 hours following initiation of standard induction chemotherapy. AML cell nuclear NF-kappaB was measured at baseline, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS: Choline magnesium trisalicylate +/- dexamethasone decreased nuclear NF-kappaB, whereas dexamethasone alone was associated with an increase in nuclear NF-kappaB in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of NF-kappaB modulation in conjunction with induction chemotherapy for patients with AML using inexpensive readily available medications. A follow-up study to determine the effects of NF-kappaB modulation on clinical end points is warranted.","['Division of Medical Oncology, The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, New Brunswick, NJ 08901, USA. strairrk@umdnj.edu']","['14/22/7564 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1390 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: ETV6/RUNX1-expressing model cell lines and leukemic cells were used for real-time PCR of EPOR expression. Proliferation, viability, and apoptosis were analyzed on cells exposed to EPO, prednisone, or inhibitors of EPOR pathways by [3H]thymidine incorporation, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, and Annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Western blot analysis was done to detect activation of signaling proteins. Serum EPO levels and sequences of the EPOR (n = 53) as well as hemoglobin levels were taken from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia enrolled in Austrian protocols. RESULTS: We show here that ectopic expression of ETV6/RUNX1 induced EPOR up-regulation. Anemia, however, did not appear to influence EPOR expression on leukemic cells, although children with ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemias had a lower median hemoglobin than controls. Exposure to EPO increased proliferation and survival of ETV6/RUNX1-positive leukemias in vitro, whereas blocking its binding site did not alter cell survival. The latter was not caused by activating mutations in the EPOR but might be triggered by constitutive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, the major signaling pathway of EPOR in these cells. Moreover, prednisone-induced apoptosis was attenuated in the presence of EPO in this genetic subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that ETV6/RUNX1 leads to EPOR up-regulation and that activation by EPO might be of relevance to the biology of this leukemia subtype. Further studies are, however, needed to assess the clinical implications of its apoptosis-modulating properties.","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderkrebsforschung, Vienna, Austria.""]","['14/22/7196 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-07-5051 [doi]']",,['P 17551/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],PMC4194425,['EMS32871'],,,,,,['NLM: EMS32871'],,,,,,,,,,,,

With intensive induction therapy, most patients younger than 60 years achieve complete remission. However, even if these younger patients were treated intensively, more than 50% will relapse. Clinical results of patients older than 60 years are more unfavorable. Therefore, in all patients with AML, the overall survival is still low. In the past decade, several leukemia-associated antigens (LAA) have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. BAGE, BCL-2, OFA-iLRP, FLT3-ITD, G250, hTERT, PRAME, proteinase 3, RHAMM, survivin, and WT-1 are all LAAs that have been shown to induce CD8+ T-cell recognition and for some antigens also humoral immune responses. Interestingly, most of these LAAs are linked to cell cycle or proliferation. This article discusses the balance between LAA-driven leukemia cell expansion and the elimination of these cells through attacks on LAAs by the immune system. Current knowledge of the function and CD8+ T-cell recognition of LAAs is reviewed and an outlook is given on how to improve T-cell responses to LAAs in acute myeloid leukemia cells.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany. jochen.greiner@uniklinik-ulm.de']","['14/22/7161 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1102 [doi]']",,,,,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Individual interviews of 37 experts. Bayesian normal models on the log hazard ratio (HR) of EFS were implemented. We illustrate our approach by using a trial of autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) vs. chemotherapy (CT) in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We elicited experts' prior beliefs about the difference in 3-year EFS between the two treatment arms, either roughly or throughout weights over the difference scale. Subsequently, a Bayesian synthesis of the information reported in the trial protocol with that in the experts' prior was performed, using: (1) the postulated treatment effect based on null (skeptical) and alternative (enthusiastic) hypotheses with shared standard error; and (2) the expected difference derived from experts' distributions. RESULTS: As compared with the priors based on the trial protocol data, expert priors agreed with some average from enthusiastic and skeptical information, with close standard errors. CONCLUSION: This case study illustrates a rational approach to construct an expert-based prior. It should be considered as part of the design of future Bayesian trials.","[""INSERM 9504, Centre d'Investigations Cliniques, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite Paris 7, France.""]","['S0895-4356(08)00229-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.04.009 [doi]']",20081117,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate their role in oral tumourigenesis, nine Bcl-2 family transcripts were examined in three oral cell lines and 25 oral tumours, using ribonuclease protection assay. Since Mcl-1 mRNA was elevated in these samples, Mcl-1 splice variants were assessed by RT-PCR and Mcl-1 protein was studied in normal, premalignant and malignant oral tissues and cell lines, by immunohistochemistry and/or immunoblotting. The cell lines exhibited significantly higher levels of 7/9 Bcl-2 family transcripts as compared to those in normal tongue, and significantly higher (p=0.030, p=0.004) anti-apoptotic versus pro-apoptotic transcripts. Elevated Mcl-1 mRNA was observed in 11/25 (44%) tumours as compared to normal tissues with a five- to ten-fold higher expression of full-length anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 transcript versus the pro-apoptotic short isoform. Strong cytoplasmic Mcl-1 immunoreactivity was detected predominantly in differentiated epithelia in 27/33 (82%) oral tumours, 18/20 (90%) leukoplakia, 25/30 (83%) submucous fibrosis and 3/3 oral cell lines, with weak staining in 8/15 (53%) normal mucosa samples. Mcl-1 positivity in malignant and premalignant tissues was comparable but significantly higher (p<0.01) than that in normal mucosa. The expression of bcl-2 family genes, including Mcl-1 in tumours, did not correlate significantly with clinicopathological parameters. This is the first report delineating the in vivo expression patterns of Mcl-1 protein and Mcl-1 transcripts in oral cancers and premalignant lesions. The observed imbalance between expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family genes may promote survival in the oral cell lines. Since the majority of oral tumours associated with tobacco-chewing evolve from premalignant lesions, the sustained expression of full-length anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein in these tissues suggests an important role for Mcl-1, early in oral cancer pathogenesis in protecting cells from apoptosis via neutralization of pro-apoptotic members and could be a potential therapeutic target for oral cancers.","['Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Kharghar, Navi Mumbai-410210, India.']",['10.1002/path.2459 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously demonstrated that infection of CLL cells with modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing the costimulatory molecules B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3 (designated TRICOM) increased expression of these costimulatory molecules on the surface of CLL cells and thus augmented their antigen-presenting capability. Here, we evaluate the effect of MVA-TRICOM-modified CLL cells on T cells. Following incubation with irradiated MVA-TRICOM-modified CLL cells, allogeneic and autologous CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells expressed significantly higher levels of B7-1, ICAM-1, and LFA-3. We show that this increase was the result of physical acquisition from the antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and that purified T cells that acquired costimulatory molecules from MVA-TRICOM-modified CLL cells were able to stimulate the proliferation of untreated T cells. These results demonstrate for the first time that T cells from CLL patients can acquire multiple costimulatory molecules from autologous CLL cells and can then act as APCs themselves. Given the immunodeficiencies characteristic of CLL, enhancing the antigen-presenting function of CLL cells and T cells simultaneously could be a distinct advantage in the effort to elicit antitumor immune responses.","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology and Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['10.1007/s00262-008-0611-5 [doi]'],20081114,['Z01 BC010598-04/ImNIH/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2664396,['NIHMS78911'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a few studies have been conducted on a detailed speciation of As(2)O(3) metabolites in blood samples of patients. To clarify the speciation of arsenic, the blood samples were collected at various time points from a patient with APL after remission induction therapy and during consolidation therapy. The total amounts of arsenic in blood cells and plasma, and the plasma concentrations of inorganic arsenic and methylated metabolites were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography/ICP-MS, respectively. The total amounts of arsenic in the blood cells were 4-10 times higher than those in plasma. Among all arsenic metabolites, the pentavalent arsenate (As(V)) in plasma was more readily eliminated. During the drug-withdrawal period, the initial plasma concentrations of trivalent arsenic (As(III)) declined more rapidly than those of methylarsonic acid and dimethlyarsinic acid, which are known as the major methylated metabolites of As(III). On the other hand, during the consecutive administration in the consolidation therapy period, the plasma concentrations of total arsenic and arsenic metabolites increased with time. In conclusion, these results may support the idea that methylated metabolites of As(2)O(3) contribute to the efficacy of arsenic in APL patients. These results also suggest that detailed studies on the pharmacokinetics as well as the pharmacodynamics of As(2)O(3) in the blood cells from APL patients should be carried out to provide an effective treatment protocol.","['Department of Clinical Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy & Life Sciences, 1432-1 Horinouchi, Hachioji, Tokyo, 192-0392, Japan.']",['10.1007/s00216-008-2487-9 [doi]'],20081114,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its etiology is unknown. The structure of membrane Ig on CLL cells of unrelated patients can be remarkably similar. Therefore, antigen binding and stimulation could contribute to clonal selection and expansion as well as disease promotion. Initial studies suggest that CLL mAbs bind autoantigens. Since apoptosis can make autoantigens accessible for recognition by antibodies, and also create neo-epitopes by chemical modifications occurring naturally during this process, we sought to determine if CLL mAbs recognize autoantigens associated with apoptosis. In general, ~60% of CLL mAbs bound the surfaces of apoptotic cells, were polyreactive, and expressed unmutated IGHV. mAbs recognized two types of antigens: native molecules located within healthy cells, which relocated to the external cell surface during apoptosis; and/or neoantigens, generated by oxidation during the apoptotic process. Some of the latter epitopes are similar to those on bacteria and other microbes. Although most of the reactive mAbs were not mutated, the use of unmutated IGHV did not bestow autoreactivity automatically, since several such mAbs were not reactive. Particular IGHV and IGHV/D/J rearrangements contributed to autoantigen binding, although the presence and degree of reactivity varied based on specific structural elements. Thus, clonal expansion in CLL may be stimulated by autoantigens occurring naturally during apoptosis. These data suggest that CLL may derive from normal B cells whose function is to remove cellular debris, and also to provide a first line of defense against pathogens.","['Feinstein Institute for Medical Research, North Shore-LIJ Health System, Manhasset, New York 11030, USA.']",['10.2119/2008-00102.Catera [doi]'],20080925,"['M01 RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA087956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR018535/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2582860,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient died from progressive SCC. Our findings agree with the high rates reported in literature of multiple tumours, local recurrence, metastases, and mortality from scc in patients with cll. Radiotherapy plays an important role in patient management, and it is the recommended treatment modality when complete surgical excision of disease would result in anatomic and functional defects. Radiotherapy is often used in the case of local recurrence after one or more attempts at surgical excision.

However, the roles played by cellular factors are only partially understood. To identify cellular processes that participate in these critical steps, we employed a high volume screening of insertionally mutagenized somatic cells using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) vector. This approach identified a role for 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate synthase 1 (PAPSS1), one of two enzymes that synthesize PAPS, the high energy sulfate donor used in all sulfonation reactions catalyzed by cellular sulfotransferases. The role of the cellular sulfonation pathway was confirmed using chemical inhibitors of PAPS synthases and cellular sulfotransferases. The requirement for sulfonation was mapped to a stage during or shortly after MLV provirus establishment and influenced subsequent gene expression from the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter. Infection of cells by an HIV vector was also shown to be highly dependent on the cellular sulfonation pathway. These studies have uncovered a heretofore unknown regulatory step of retroviral replication, have defined a new biological function for sulfonation in nuclear gene expression, and provide a potentially valuable new target for HIV/AIDS therapy.","['Institute for Molecular Virology, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA.']",['10.1371/journal.ppat.1000207 [doi]'],20081114,"['AI72645/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'R01 AI072645/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA022443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22443/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2576444,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple nonmutated, overexpressed proteins that function in tumor cell migration, protein/nucleic acid homeostasis, metabolism, and stress responses were detected. Among these, the most frequently recognized clone was protein disulfide isomerase (PDI). High titer antibodies to human PDI were similarly induced in an acute myeloid leukemia patient who achieved a complete response after vaccination with irradiated, autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells in the setting of nonmyeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Moreover, ERp5, a closely related disulfide isomerase involved in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related protein A (MICA) shedding, also evoked potent humoral reactions in diverse solid and hematologic malignancy patients who responded to GM-CSF-secreting tumor cell vaccines or antibody blockade of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4).

ABT-263 shows promising activity in early phase 1 clinical trials in B-cell malignancies, particularly chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). In vitro, peripheral blood CLL cells are extremely sensitive to ABT-737 (EC(50) approximately 7 nM), with rapid induction of apoptosis in all 60 patients tested, independent of parameters associated with disease progression and chemotherapy resistance. In contrast to data from cell lines, ABT-737-induced apoptosis in CLL cells was largely MCL1-independent. Because CLL cells within lymph nodes are more resistant to apoptosis than those in peripheral blood, CLL cells were cultured on CD154-expressing fibroblasts in the presence of interleukin-4 (IL-4) to mimic the lymph node microenvironment. CLL cells thus cultured developed an approximately 1000-fold resistance to ABT-737 within 24 hours. Investigations of the underlying mechanism revealed that this resistance occurred upstream of mitochondrial perturbation and involved de novo synthesis of the antiapoptotic proteins BCL-X(L) and BCL2A1, which were responsible for resistance to low and high ABT-737 concentrations, respectively. Our data indicate that after therapy with ABT-737-related inhibitors, resistant CLL cells might develop in lymph nodes in vivo and that treatment strategies targeting multiple BCL2 antiapoptotic members simultaneously may have synergistic activity.","['Medical Research Council Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom.']","['S0006-4971(20)39250-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-173310 [doi]']",20081113,"['MC_U132615750/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U132670597/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,"['Blood. 2009 Apr 30;113(18):4132-3.

Long-term survivors were found among elderly given intensive treatment despite poor initial PS. Total survival of elderly AML patients was better in the geographic regions where most of them were given standard intensive therapy. This analysis provides unique real world data from a large, complete, and unselected AML population, both treated and untreated, and gives background to treatment decisions for the elderly.

We have recently reported the successful retargeting of the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus vector. This vector (S3-D84K) contains a viral envelope (Env) protein into which a full-length (68 aa) stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha) was inserted at Pro-79. The S3-D84K vector transduces a certain human cell line through the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) at a titre of about 10(4) c.f.u. ml(-1). Here, the S3-D84K vector was found to transduce another human cell line through CXCR4 with a titre close to 10(6) c.f.u. ml(-1). The SDF-1alpha ligand of the S3-D84K Env protein was modified in different ways. In one, C-terminal truncations (by 3-51 aa) with or without a Cys-to-Gly change were performed, and in the other, Cys-to-Ala changes of the disulfide-forming cysteines without truncation were made. Seven truncation and three alanine mutant chimeric Env proteins were examined for virion incorporation, and the retroviral vectors displaying the mutant protein were examined for CXCR4 binding and retargeted transduction. Two mutant vectors showed transduction through CXCR4 with titres not higher than those of the S3-D84K vector, while the other mutant vectors minimally transduced cells through CXCR4 either due to a defect in virion incorporation of the chimeric Env protein or an inability to bind to CXCR4. These results suggest that a full-length sequence that may fold into a distinct domain within the chimeric Env protein is preferable as a targeting ligand.","['Discovery Research Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0192, Japan.', 'Discovery Research Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0192, Japan.', 'Discovery Research Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0192, Japan.', 'Department of AIDS Research, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan.', 'Discovery Research Institute, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0192, Japan.']",['10.1099/vir.0.2008/006031-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies suggest that the gain-of-function (GOF) mutations of SHP-2 play a causal role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GOF mutations of SHP-2 induce these phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we show that GOF mutations in SHP-2, such as E76K and D61G, drastically increase spreading and migration of various cell types, including hematopoietic cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts. More importantly, in vivo angiogenesis in SHP-2 D61G knock-in mice is also enhanced. Mechanistic studies suggest that the increased cell migration is attributed to the enhanced beta1 integrin outside-in signaling. In response to beta1 integrin cross-linking or fibronectin stimulation, activation of ERK and Akt kinases is greatly increased by SHP-2 GOF mutations. Also, integrin-induced activation of RhoA and Rac1 GTPases is elevated. Interestingly, mutant cells with the SHP-2 GOF mutation (D61G) are more sensitive than wild-type cells to the suppression of cell motility by inhibition of these pathways. Collectively, these studies reaffirm the positive role of SHP-2 phosphatase in cell motility and suggest a new mechanism by which SHP-2 GOF mutations contribute to diseases.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Case Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.']","['S0021-9258(20)71106-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804129200 [doi]']",20081113,"['HL082670/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL076810/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA049152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL068212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL089796/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 HL082670/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66600/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL068212/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2613626,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bDNA amplifier carrying high loading of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) tracers was used to amplify the target signal. The targets were captured on microplate well surfaces through cooperative sandwich hybridization prior to the labeling of bDNA. The activity of captured ALP was monitored by square-wave voltammetric (SWV) analysis of the electroactive enzymatic product in the presence of 1-naphthyl phosphate. The voltammetric characteristics of substrate and enzymatic product as well as the parameters of SWV analysis were systematically optimized. A detection limit of 1 fM (1 x 10(-19) mol of target transcripts in 100 microL) and a 3-order-wide dynamic range of target concentration were achieved by the electrochemical bDNA assay. Such limit corresponded to approximately 17 fg of the p185 BCR-ABL fusion transcripts. The specificity and sensitivity of assay enabled direct detection of target transcripts in as little as 4.6 ng of mRNA population without PCR amplification. In combination with the use of a well-quantified standard, the electrochemical bDNA assay was capable of direct use for a PCR-free quantitative analysis of target transcripts in mRNA population. A mean transcript copy number of 62,900/ng of mRNA was determined, which was at least 50-fold higher than that of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). The finding was consistent with the underestimation of targets by qPCR reported earlier. In addition, the unique design based on bDNA technology increases the assay specificity as only the p185 BCR-ABL fusion transcripts will respond to the detection. The approach thus provides a simple, sensitive, accurate, and quantitative tool alternative to the qPCR for early disease diagnosis.","['Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington 99352, USA.']",['10.1021/ac801263r [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Importantly, bone marrow pathology was triggered by relative insufficiency in regulatory T (Treg) cells and was prevented by added Treg cells, which suppressed the local IFN-gamma production by FV-specific CD4(+) T cells. We further showed that the T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire of transgenic Treg cells expressing the beta chain of an FV-specific TCR was virtually devoid of FV-specific clones. Moreover, anemia induction by virus-specific CD4(+) T cells was efficiently suppressed by virus-nonspecific Treg cells.

In addition to the original description, low-normal IgA levels, low to low-normal platelet counts and reduced natural killer (NK)-cell counts also appear as consistent XLN features. However, inverted CD4/CD8 ratios were not found in this family, nor were cases identified with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia. Female carriers exhibited a variable attenuated phenotype. Like L270P WASP, I294T WASP is constitutively active towards actin polymerization. In conclusion, this largest XLN kindred identified to date provides new independent genetic evidence that mutations disrupting the auto-inhibitory GBD of WASP are the cause of XLN.

We hypothesized that targeting epigenetic changes might address these issues and evaluated the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproate (VPA) at a clinically relevant concentration. VPA acted in a highly synergistic/additive manner with fludarabine and cladribine to induce apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Importantly, VPA also restored sensitivity to fludarabine in B cells from poor prognosis CLL patients who became resistant to chemotherapy. Mechanism of apoptosis induced by VPA alone or combined with fludarabine or to cladribine was caspase-dependent and involved the extrinsic pathway. VPA, but neither fludarabine nor cladribine, enhanced the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of ROS with N-acetylcysteine decreases apoptosis of CLL cells. VPA stimulates hyperphosphorylation of p42/p44 ERK, cytochrome c release and overexpression of Bax and Fas. Together, our data indicate that VPA may ameliorate the outcome of PNA-based therapeutic protocols and provide a potential alternative treatment in both the relapsed and front-line resistant patients and in patients with high risk features.","['National Fund for Scientific Research, Molecular and Cellular Biology, FUSAG, Gembloux, Belgium.']","['BJH7426 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1365-2141.2008.07426.x [doi]']",20081101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively assessed the prevalence of submicroscopic bone marrow (BM) minimal disseminated disease (MDD) at diagnosis and the early response to treatment (minimal residual disease--MRD) and their prognostic significance in 17 children with stage III T-LLy treated according to Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) non-Hodgkin lymphoma protocols. PROCEDURE: Four-color flow cytometry (FC) was used for lymphoma associated immunophenotype and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) for T-cell receptor (TCR beta/delta/gamma) gene rearrangements with at least 0.01% sensitivity. RESULTS: Two markers per patient were identified in all cases using FC and in 80% using RQ-PCR. BM MDD at diagnosis of >or=0.01% was detected by FC and RQ-PCR in 88% and 80% of patients, respectively, and by at least one of the methods in all patients. A significant correlation was achieved between the methods by Pearson correlation analysis (P = 0.004). MRD levels significantly decreased to very low levels on day 33 in 9 out of 10 patients studied. The only patient that remained positive relapsed. CONCLUSIONS: MDD was prevalent in stage III T-LLy, for which we could not prove a prognostic significance in the context of ALL-like treatment. This study shows that both FC and RQ-PCR methods are efficient for MDD and MRD analyses in T-LLy.","[""Center of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Schneider Children's Medical Center of Israel, Petah Tiqwa, Israel. bstark@clalit.org.il""]",['10.1002/pbc.21823 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The role of biochemical MTX-induced alterations of the folate and methyl-transfer pathway in the development of neurotoxic symptoms is not yet fully elucidated. PROCEDURE: MTX, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, calcium folinate, S-adenosylmethionine, and S-adenosylhomocysteine were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 29 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who were treated with high-dose MTX (5 g/m(2)) followed by calcium folinate rescue (3 x 15 mg/m(2)) and/or intrathecal (8-12 mg) MTX. Two patients developed subacute MTX-associated neurotoxicity. CSF was obtained by lumbal puncture 1-3 weeks after administration of MTX and shortly after the occurrence of neurotoxicity. The analytes were measured using HPLC assays with UV and/or fluorescence detection. RESULTS: In non-toxic patients, CSF concentrations of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and S-adenosylmethionine were in the normal range 2 weeks after administration of high-dose and intrathecal MTX followed by rescue. In contrast, when these patients received intrathecal MTX without rescue, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate concentrations were significantly decreased 12 days after the first MTX administration. S-adenosylmethionine concentrations were significantly decreased up to 45 days. The two patients suffering from neurotoxicity had decreased levels of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and S-adenosylmethionine during or following toxicity. S-adenosylhomocysteine was determined in all samples of neurotoxic patients but was below the limit of quantification in most samples of non-toxic patients. Calcium folinate was not detected; MTX was present only in samples obtained during its infusion. CONCLUSION: Intrathecal MTX without folinate rescue as well as MTX-associated neurotoxicity are likely to be associated with specific alterations of the folate and methyl-transfer pathway.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, Institute of Pharmacy, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany.']",['10.1002/pbc.21827 [doi]'],,,,,['Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2009 Jul;53(1):127; author reply 127-8.

The Bcr-Abl protein induces the upregulation of proto-oncogene c-Jun, which is involved in Bcr-Abl transforming activity in Bcr-Abl positive cells. Recent studies reported that c-Jun inhibited hemoglobin synthesis in human CML cell line K562. However, c-Jun also plays a critical role in cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the physiological roles of c-Jun in cell proliferation, apoptosis and erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Firstly, we generated K562 cell lines stably overexpressing c-Jun. These clones have the same proliferation rate as the parental cell line in general culture medium. Endogenous c-Jun expression was analyzed to determine the effective concentration of STI571 for inhibiting Bcr-Abl signaling. Western blots show that STI571 inhibited c-Jun expression in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum inhibition at 1 microM. STI571 could inhibit c-Jun expression in K562 cells, but not in c-Jun-overexpression cells. c-Jun did not alter growth inhibition and apoptotic induction by STI571 treatment, but inhibited STI571-induced erythroid differentiation. Moreover, c-Jun did not alter growth inhibition and apoptotic induction by histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (apicidin, sodium butyrate, and MS275) treatment, but inhibited HDAC inhibitors-induced erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that c-Jun may modulate anticancer drugs-induced cell differentiation but not growth inhibition and apoptosis in CML cells.","['Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan. cmbhhm@tmu.edu.tw']",['10.1002/jcp.21627 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New induction regimens have significantly increased complete response rate before and after ASCT with a positive impact on progression-free survival. Maintenance therapy with thalidomide, under investigation with lenalidomide, may further prolong remission duration. In patients not eligible for ASCT, randomized studies have shown that melphalan, prednisone, thalidomide (MPT) and melphalan, prednisone and bortezomib (MPV) are both superior to melphalan and prednisone (MP), and are now considered standard of care.

In this study, we analyzed the function of human monocyte-derived APCs generated in vitro in the presence of interleukin (IL)-10 upon activation by TLR ligands. Exposure of these APCs to IL-10 resulted in a skewed phenotypic maturation in response to stimuli provided by the TLR ligands, a reduced cytokine production, such as IL-12, IL-6 or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and impaired capacity to stimulate T-cell activation. Furthermore, CCR7 upregulation in APCs exposed to TLR stimulation as well as migration towards CCL19/MIP-3beta were strongly reduced. IL-10 was found to downregulate MyD88, IRAK1 (IL-1 receptor-associated kinase) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6, essential adaptor molecules for TLR signaling, and to decrease TLR-induced nuclear expression of the nuclear factor-kappaB transcription factors c-Rel and Rel-B as well as interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-8. This was not due to the inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, but was rather mediated by the blockage of the PI3K signaling cascade. Interestingly, the inhibition of proteins involved in TLR signaling, such as MyD88, IRAK1 and mammalian target of rapamycin, was due to a selective post-transcriptional regulation.","['Department of Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmology, University of Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']","['leu2008301 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.301 [doi]']",20081113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This suggests that the high degree of proliferation of the MPN clone reduces TL and suggests the possibility that TL shortening may be indicative of progressive genomic instability during MPN progression. The TL of JAK2V617F-negative MPN patients was similar to JAK2V617F-positive counterparts (T/S 0.527 vs 0.507, P=0.603), suggesting that the yet-to-be-discovered causative mutation(s) impact the mutated stem cell similarly to JAK2V617F, and that TL measurement may prove useful in the diagnostic workup of JAK2V617F-negative MPN.","['Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']","['leu2008319 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.319 [doi]']",20081113,"['K08 HL082677/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC4640467,['NIHMS735614'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated how nucleophosmin NES motifs (two physiological and one created by the mutation) regulate traffic and interaction of mutated NPM1, NPM1wt and p14(ARF). Nucleophosmin export into cytoplasm was maximum when the protein contained all three NES motifs, as naturally occurs in NPM1-mutated AML. The two physiological NES motifs mediated NPM1 homo/heterodimerization, influencing subcellular distribution of NPM1wt, mutated NPM1 and p14(ARF) in a 'dose-dependent tug of war' fashion. In transfected cells, excess doses of mutant NPM1 relocated completely NPM1wt (and p14(ARF)) from the nucleoli to the cytoplasm. This distribution pattern was also observed in a proportion of NPM1-mutated AML patients. In transfected cells, excess of NPM1wt (and p14(ARF)) relocated NPM1 mutant from the cytoplasm to the nucleoli. Notably, this distribution pattern was not observed in AML patients where the mutant was consistently cytoplasmic restricted. These findings reinforce the concept that NPM1 mutants are naturally selected for most efficient cytoplasmic export, pointing to this event as critical for leukaemogenesis. Moreover, they provide a rationale basis for designing small molecules acting at the interface between mutated NPM1 and other interacting proteins.","['Section of Haematology and Immunology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Perugia, IBiT Foundation, Fondazione IRCCS Biotecnologie nel Trapianto, Perugia, Italy.']","['leu2008326 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.326 [doi]']",20081113,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed with fluorescence microscopy that cytoskeletal F-actin concentrates in the same regions as cell surface IgE-Fc epsilonRI that bind to the micrometer-size patterned ligands. However, the proteins mediating these cytoskeletal connections and their functional relevance were not known. We now show that whereas the adaptor proteins ezrin and moesin do not detectably concentrate with the array of clustered IgE-Fc epsilonRI, focal adhesion proteins vinculin, paxillin, and talin, which are known to link F-actin with integrins, accumulate in these regions on the same time scale as F-actin. Moreover, colocalization of these focal adhesion proteins with clustered IgE-Fc epsilonRI is enhanced after addition of fibronectin-RGD peptides. Significantly, the most prominent rat basophilic leukemia cell integrin (alpha5) avoids the patterned regions occupied by the ligands and associates preferentially with exposed regions of the silicon substrate. Thus, spatial separation provided by the patterned surface reveals that particular focal adhesion proteins, which connect to the actin cytoskeleton, associate with ligand-cross-linked IgE-Fc epsilonRI, independently of integrins. We investigated the functional role of one of these proteins, paxillin, in IgE-Fc epsilonRI-mediated signaling by using small interfering RNA. From these results, we determine that paxillin reduces stimulated phosphorylation of the Fc epsilonRI beta subunit but enhances stimulated Ca(2+) release from intracellular stores. The results suggest that paxillin associated with clustered IgE-Fc epsilonRI has a net positive effect on Fc epsilonRI signaling.","['Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853, USA.']","['105/45/17238 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0802138105 [doi]']",,"['R01 AI018306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI18306/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2582307,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transgenic expression of PLZF during T cell development and in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells induced a T cell intrinsic program leading to an increase in peripheral CD44(hi) MP CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and a corresponding decrease of naive CD44(lo) T cells. The MP CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells produced IFNgamma upon PMA/ionomycin stimulation, thus showing innate-like function. Changes in the naive versus memory-like subset distribution were already evident in single-positive thymocytes, indicating PLZF-induced T cell developmental alterations. In addition, CD1d-restricted natural killer T cells in PLZF transgenic mice showed impaired development and were severely reduced in the periphery. Finally, after anti-CD3/CD28 stimulation, CD4(+) transgenic T cells showed reduced IL-2 and IFNgamma production but increased IL-4 secretion as a result of enhanced IL-4 production of the CD44(hi)CD62L(+) subset. Our data indicate that PLZF is a novel regulator of the development of CD44(hi) MP T cells with a characteristic partial innate-like phenotype.","['Division of Immunobiology, Institute of Immunology, Center for Physiology, Pathophysiology and Immunology, Medical University of Vienna, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']","['0805733105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0805733105 [doi]']",20081112,"['F 2305/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'P 19930/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria', 'Y 163/FWF_/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria']",PMC2584723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that IEL are regulated through the interaction of the CD8alpha alpha homodimer with the thymus leukemia (TL) antigen expressed by intestinal epithelial cells. We have generated and characterized mice genetically-deficient in TL expression. Our findings show that TL expression has a critical role in maintaining IEL effector functions.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Incidence rates were examined by age, sex and period of diagnosis and differences were tested using Poisson regression. Differences and trends in survival were assessed using Cox regression. RESULTS: 1680 subjects were included comprising 948 leukaemias and 732 lymphomas. Incidence rates for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were significantly higher for 0-14 compared to 15-24-year-olds, whilst Hodgkin lymphoma showed the reverse. No significant changes in incidence were observed. 60% of leukaemia patients aged 15-24 years entered trials compared to 92% of 0-14-year-olds. Survival rates were significantly lower and improved less markedly over time for 15-24 compared to 0-14-year-olds, particularly for leukaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Trial accrual rates need to be improved amongst 15-24-year-olds and a more structured follow-up approach adopted for this unique population.","['University of Leeds, Paediatric Epidemiology Group, Centre for Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Worsley Building, Clarendon Way, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK. r.g.feltbower@leeds.ac.uk']","['S0959-8049(08)00754-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2008.09.020 [doi]']",20081112,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the combined use of two methods, we analyzed a set of microarray data at 11 time points from three mouse embryonic stem cell lines cultivated with and without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) for 14 days. Albeit the expression of individual genes in signaling pathways was not noticeably different between cells cultivated with and without LIF, at gene-set level the expression of ERK/MAPK (but not JAK/STAT) and cell cycle related genes was found significantly enriched in cells cultivated with LIF. This indicates that the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway, in addition to JAK/STAT, may also be a key player to carry on external LIF signal into mouse embryonic stem cells to promote self-renewal. When data at the first 7 time points were compared with data at the last 4 time points, the expression of several cell cycle related gene sets was apparently enriched in all three cell lines, indicating the active cell proliferation in the first 2 days. Compared with the slight decay of Oct4/Nanog/Sox2 during the 14 days, the expression of cell differentiation genes such as Gata4/6 underwent a drastic increase, which indicates that the upregulated expression of cell differentiation genes may better reflect the loss of self renewal than the down regulated expression of the stemness indicators Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Apart from differential expression and gene set enrichment analyses, a clustering algorithm was also used to classify genes into co-expression clusters. The possible regulation of two clusters, whose expression was most changed during cell culture from very low to very high, was explored.

In the search for appropriate strategies a bottleneck exists, however, concerning the targeting of vectors carrying the therapeutic gene, to all pathologic sites. These diseases are often characterised by multiple widespread lesions spread over a large area, rendering administration by local injection into tissues, clinically irrelevant. With this in mind, we have proposed that circulating cells (monocytes/macrophages), which home naturally to inflammatory lesions, characteristic of degenerating muscle, could be used as shuttles able to track down every damaged site, and deliver there a corrective gene. Our aim is to mobilise a corrective gene from these infiltrating monocyte-macrophages, into muscle cells, a process of in situ cell to cell gene transfer which could be accomplished using a retroviral vector, since the regeneration process involves the proliferation of muscle precursors before they fuse to form replacement fibres. For this, monocyte-macrophages must be engineered into 'packaging cells' containing both the replication deficient retrovirus carrying the gene of interest and an helper genome (gag-pol-env) needed for its assembly and secretion. Here, we have transduced a monocyte cell line using a defective murine Moloney leukemia retrovirus carrying the LacZ reporter gene. This provided us with a platform to investigate the possibility of gag-pol-env vector driven packaging of the defective retrovirus by macrophages. We show that an herpes simplex virus type I amplicon harbouring the Moloney gag, pol, env sequences is able to rescue the defective retrovirus vector from macrophages, allowing gene transfer into muscle precursor cells. After fusion, these cells gave rise to genetically modified myotubes in vitro.","[""Genethon - CNRS URA 1922, 1 bis Rue de l'Internationale, 91002, Evry, France.""]",['10.1023/A:1008022713466 [doi]'],,,PMC3449948,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two important issues that need to be addressed are the culture conditions for maintaining ES cells and the accuracy of ES cell markers in monitoring the undifferentiated state. Leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is routinely used to sustain mouse ES cells (mES) in a pluripotent fashion. In this paper, we assessed three markers during long-term maintenance of ES cells with various concentrations of LIF to see if decreasing concentration would lead to changes in marker expressions and growth behavior. Common markers of pluripotency such as alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity (ALP), surface staining for stage specific embryonic antigen 1 (SSEA-1), Oct-4 transcription factor, cell doubling time, as well as visual observations of cell morphology were analyzed during long-term maintenance of mES cells with LIF concentrations ranging from 0 to 500 pM. The morphology of the cells at LIF concentrations of 0 25 pM changed from being tight clusters to more flattened shapes while cells in 50-500 pM retained the clustered shape but growth rates remained essentially identical at between 10 and 16 h. ES cells at all concentrations of LIF continued expressing ALP, SSEA-1 and Oct-4 markers over a period of 6 weeks, which indicate that mES cells are capable of either producing autocrine LIF or are able to proliferate at very low levels of LIF. Pluripotency markers such as Oct-4 and SSEA-1 are only moderately reduced after 5-6 weeks. Oct-4 mRNA expression levels were partially diminished in LIF free conditions only at weeks 5 and 6 compared to controls with LIF at 500 pM. Changes in morphology of cells by visual observation seemed to be a faster indication of the onset of differentiation in mES cells, although other reliable means also include decreased levels of Oct-4, SSEA-1 and ALP markers. It is preferable to maintain long-term cultures of mES cells above 50 pM of LIF to have a more homogenous, stable population of pluripotent cells.",,['10.1023/B:CYTO.0000043414.90681.c2 [doi]'],,,PMC3449498,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we attempted to enhance the cell surface expression of FcepsilonRI on hydrocortisone (HC)- or sodium nitroprusside (SNP)-treated KU812 cells by IgE. The cell surface FcepsilonRI expression was observed in about 20, 20 and 26% of 1 muM HC-, 1 nM SNP- and 450 ng ml(-1) IgE-treated KU812 cells, respectively. Whereas, the cell surface FcepsilonRI expression was observed in about 54% of KU812 cells treated with both 450 ng ml(-1) IgE and 1 muM HC for 8 days, and in about 33% of KU812 cells treated with both 450 ng ml(-1) IgE and 1 nM SNP for 4 days. Ninety five% of the IgE/HC- or IgE/SNP-treated KU812 cells expressed CD 13 antigen, a cell surface marker of basophils.

Therefore, the repair of such lesions is of major importance for the sensitivity of malignant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. The underlying mechanisms of various DNA repair pathways have extensively been studied in yeast, bacteria and mammalian cells. Sensitive and drug resistant cancer cell lines have provided models for analysis of the contribution of DNA repair to chemosensitivity. However, the validity of results obtained by laboratory experiments with regard to the clinical situation is limited. In both acute and chronic leukaemias, the emergence of drug resistant cells is a major cause for treatment failure. Recently, assays have become available to measure cellular DNA repair capacity in clinical specimens at the single-cell level. Application of these assays to isolated lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphatic leukaemia (CLL) revealed large interindividual differences in DNA repair rates. Accelerated O(6)-ethylguanine elimination from DNA and faster processing of repair-induced single-strand breaks were found in CLL lymphocytes from patients nonresponsive to chemotherapy with alkylating agents compared to untreated or treated sensitive patients. Moreover, modulators of DNA repair with different target mechanisms were identified which also influence the sensitivity of cancer cells to alkylating agents.

This article describes two important aspects, i.e., 1) a role of the MRP/GS-X pump in the modulation of cell cycle arrest induced by anticancer prostaglandins; 2) coordinated up-regulation of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase gamma-GCS) and MRP1 genes. The A and J series of prostaglandins (PGs) accumulate in the nuclei to suppress the proliferation of cancer cells. Delta(7)-Prostaglandin A(1) (Delta(7)-PGA(1)) methyl ester, a synthetic anticancer PG, increased the mRNA level of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Sdi1/CIP1/WAF1) in human leukemia HL-60 cells. The induction of p21(Sdi1/CIP1/WAF1) was associated with the accumulation of hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRB) and the suppression of c-myc gene expression. Unlike HL-60 cells, cisplatin-resistant HL-60/R-CP cells were insensitive to Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester. While c-myc expression was transiently suppressed, neither G1 arrest nor hypophosphorylation of pRB was observed with the anticancer PG. Plasma membrane vesicles from HL-60/R-CP cells showed an enhanced level of GS-X pump activity toward the glutathione S-conjugate of Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester. GIF-0019, a potent inhibitor of the GS-X pump, dose-dependently enhanced the cellular sensitivity of HL-60/R-CP cells to Delta(7)-PGA(1) methyl ester, resulting in G1 arrest. The GS-X pump is suggested to play a pivotal role in modulating the biological action of the anticancer PG. The expression of MRP1 and gamma-GCS genes can be coordinately up-regulated by cisplatin, 1-[5-(4-amino-2-methyl)pyrimidyl]methyl-3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea (ACNU), and heavy metals in human cancer cells. For the up-regulation of these genes, both transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations are considered to be involved.",,['10.1023/A:1008036015156 [doi]'],,,PMC3449568,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since T-araC has a vastly superior preclinical efficacy profile in comparison to araC, we have initiated studies to determine the potential value of clofarabine/T-araC combination therapy. METHODS: In vitro studies have been conducted to determine the effect of clofarabine on the metabolism of T-araC, and in vivo studies have been conducted to determine the effect of the clofarabine/T-araC combination on five human tumor xenografts in mice. RESULTS: Initial studies with various tumor cells in culture indicated that a 2-h incubation with clofarabine enhanced the metabolism of T-araC 24 h after its removal by threefold in three tumor cell types (HCT-116 colon, K562 leukemia, and RL lymphoma) and by 1.5-fold in two other tumor cell types (MDA-MB-435 breast (melanoma), and HL-60 leukemia). Pretreatment with clofarabine resulted in a slight decrease in metabolism of T-araC in RPMI-8226 myeloma cells (65% of control) and inhibited metabolism of T-araC in CCRF-CEM leukemia cells by 90%. In vivo combination studies were conducted with various human tumor xenografts to determine whether or not the modulations observed in vitro were reflective of the in vivo situation. Clofarabine and T-araC were administered on alternate days for five treatments each (q2dx5) with the administration of T-araC 24 h after each clofarabine treatment. Combination treatment of HCT-116, K562, HL-60, or RL tumors with clofarabine and T-araC resulted in dramatically superior anti-tumor activity than treatment with either agent alone, whereas this combination resulted in antagonism in CCRF-CEM tumors. The in vivo antitumor activity of clofarabine plus T-araC against HCT-116 tumors was much better than the activity seen with clofarabine plus araC.

AML mononuclear cells (n = 17) were sorted in CD34(+) and CD34(-) fractions and compared to normal CD34(+/-) cells (n = 7). The percentage of surviving cells upon exposure to lovastatin (25-100 microM) and/or chemotherapeutics (cytarabin or daunorubicin) was determined with a luminescent cell viability assay. The results demonstrate that the primitive CD34(+) subpopulation of normal and AML cells displayed a higher sensitivity to lovastatin than the more mature CD34(-) subpopulation. The combination of lovastatin and chemotherapeutics resulted in a more pronounced inhibitory effect on both subpopulations. In contrast to the homogeneous results in normal CD34(+) cells, a distinct heterogeneity in lovastatin sensitivity was found in AML samples. Therefore, a group of normal (n = 11) and abnormal (n = 6) responders were identified based on a reduced or increased cell survival compared to normal CD34(+) cells. This distinction was not only observed in the CD34(+) AML subfraction but also in CD34(+)CD38(-)AML cells. In the abnormal responder group, 50% of patients presented with unfavorable cytogenetics and significant higher peripheral blast cell counts, which coincided with poor treatment results. In summary, the findings indicate that the primitive subfraction of CD34(+) AML cells is in the majority of cases affected by lovastatin treatment, which is potentiated when combined with chemotherapeutics. Heterogeneity of the response observed in AML patients allowed identification of a subgroup with poor prognosis.","['Department of Hematology, University of Groningen, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0633-2 [doi]'],20081111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High levels of NKG2A on NK cells have been shown to compromise the graft-versus-leukemia effect in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We therefore evaluated the functional relevance of NKG2A silencing for the cytotoxic potential of genetically engineered NK and T cells. Lentiviral vectors containing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences targeting NKG2A transcripts were used to transduce NKG2A(+) primary NK and T cells. NKG2A expression levels were measured by flow cytometry and real-time PCR. The effect of NKG2A silencing on the cytolytic potential of NK and T cells was evaluated in cytotoxicity assays using K562 and B lymphoblastoid cells as targets. Granzyme B mRNA transcript levels were detected by real-time PCR. The transduction of inducible RNAi cassettes containing the sequences for shRNAs targeting NKG2A reduced protein expression in NK and T cells by up to 95%. The cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that NKG2A silencing effectively enhanced NK and CD8+ T-cell lysis by up to 40% and 15%, respectively. However, lysis of K562 cells which lack human leukocyte antigen-E, the ligand of NKG2A, was associated with an upregulation of the natural cytotoxicity receptor NKp30 in NKG2A-silenced NK cells. Our data suggest that RNAi-mediated silencing of NKG2A in effector cells could improve the efficacy of cell-based immunotherapies but also show that indirect effects of NKG2A knockdown exist that have to be considered when designing therapeutic protocols with genetically engineered NK or T cells.","['Institute for Transfusion Medicine, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg-Str. 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany.']",['10.1007/s00109-008-0417-0 [doi]'],20081111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 250 events of thrombosis were observed in 138 (43.13%) patients. Advanced age, prior thrombosis and hemoglobin out of control were statistically significant risk factors of incidences of thrombotic events. A total of 43 patients progressed into MMM at a median time of 84 (7-240) months, higher white blood cell (WBC) count, splenomegaly, receiving alkylating agent and hydroxycarbamide were associated with the progression into MMM. During the follow-up time, 11 and 2 patients died of fatal complications of thrombosis and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), respectively. These results suggest that advanced age, prior thrombosis and hemoglobin out of control contributed to relatively high incidence of thromboembolism; higher WBC count, splenomegaly, receiving alkylating agent and hydroxycarbamide were risk factors of evolution to MMM. The main poor factors that influenced the survival of Chinese PV patients were incidences of thromboembolism and evolution into AML.","[""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China."", ""Polycythemia Vera Studying Program, Institute of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College, 288 Nanjing Road, 300020, Tianjin, People's Republic of China. zheng_yizhou@hotmail.com.""]","['10.1007/s12185-008-0188-y [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-008-0188-y [pii]']",20081111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(8;21)-related AML1-ETO fusion protein blocks differentiation of myeloid progenitors. Here, we show by immunofluorescence microscopy that during interphase, endogenous AML1-ETO localizes to nuclear microenvironments distinct from those containing native RUNX1/AML1 protein. At mitosis, we clearly detect binding of AML1-ETO to nucleolar-organizing regions in AML-derived Kasumi-1 cells and binding of RUNX1/AML1 to the same regions in Jurkat cells. Both RUNX1/AML1 and AML1-ETO occupy ribosomal DNA repeats during interphase, as well as interact with the endogenous RNA Pol I transcription factor UBF1. Promoter cytosine methylation analysis indicates that RUNX1/AML1 binds to rDNA repeats that are more highly CpG methylated than those bound by AML1-ETO. Downregulation by RNA interference reveals that RUNX1/AML1 negatively regulates rDNA transcription, whereas AML1-ETO is a positive regulator in Kasumi-1 cells. Taken together, our findings identify a novel role for the leukemia-related AML1-ETO protein in epigenetic control of cell growth through upregulation of ribosomal gene transcription mediated by RNA Pol I, consistent with the hyper-proliferative phenotype of myeloid cells in AML patients.","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA 01655, USA.']","['jcs.033431 [pii]', '10.1242/jcs.033431 [doi]']",20081111,"['P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA082834-08/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2904240,['NIHMS211032'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorafenib (Nexavar, BAY43-9006), a multikinase inhibitor, blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in a variety of tumor cells. Sorafenib inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in two established cell lines (Daoy and D283) and a primary culture (VC312) of human medulloblastomas. In addition, sorafenib inhibited phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in both cell lines and primary tumor cells. The inhibition of phosphorylated STAT3 (Tyr(705)) occurs in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In contrast, AKT (protein kinase B) was only decreased in D283 and VC312 medulloblastoma cells and mitogen-activated protein kinases (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) were not inhibited by sorafenib in these cells. Both D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) and E-type cyclin were down-regulated by sorafenib. Also, expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, a member of the Bcl-2 family, was decreased and correlated with apoptosis induced by sorafenib. Finally, sorafenib suppressed the growth of human medulloblastoma cells in a mouse xenograft model. Together, our data show that sorafenib blocks STAT3 signaling as well as expression of cell cycle and apoptosis regulatory proteins, associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in medulloblastomas.

Here we show that monocytic leukemia zinc finger (MOZ) forms a complex with p53 to induce p21 expression and cell-cycle arrest. The levels of the p53-MOZ complex increased in response to DNA damage to levels that induce cell-cycle arrest. MOZ(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to arrest in G1 in response to DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced expression of p21 was impaired in MOZ(-/-) cells. These results suggest that MOZ is involved in regulating cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase. Screening of tumor-associated p53 mutants demonstrated that the G279E mutation in p53 disrupts interactions between p53 and MOZ, but does not affect the DNA binding activity of p53. The leukemia-associated MOZ-CBP fusion protein inhibits p53-mediated transcription. These results suggest that inhibition of p53/MOZ-mediated transcription is involved in tumor pathogenesis and leukemogenesis.","['Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', 'Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', 'Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', 'Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', 'Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.', 'Molecular Oncology Division, Radiobiology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo 104-0045 and the Department of Molecular Cellular Oncology and Microbiology, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8510, Japan.

Mouse models replicate a number of these phenotypes. The Tc1 Down syndrome model was constructed by introducing a single supernumerary human chromosome 21 into a mouse embryonic stem cell, and it reproduces a large number of Down syndrome phenotypes including heart development defects. However, little is still known about the developmental onset of the trisomy 21-induced mechanisms behind these phenotypes or the proteins that are responsible for them. This study determined the proteomic differences that are present in undifferentiated embryonic stem cells and are caused by an additional human chromosome 21. A total of 1661 proteins were identified using two-dimensional liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry from whole embryonic stem cell lysates. Using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification, we found 52 proteins that differed in expression by greater than two standard deviations from the mean when an extra human chromosome 21 was present. Of these, at least 11 have a possible functional association with a Down syndrome phenotype or a human chromosome 21-encoded gene. This study also showed that quantitative protein expression differences in embryonic stem cells can persist to adult mouse as well as reproduce in human Down syndrome fetal tissue. This indicates that changes that are determined in embryonic stem cells of Down syndrome could potentially identify proteins that are involved in phenotypes of Down syndrome, and it shows that these cell lines can be used for the purpose of studying these pathomechanisms.","['Institute of Mass-Spectrometry, School of Medicine, Swansea University, Singleton Park, Swansea SA2 8PP, United Kingdom.']","['S1535-9476(20)32948-0 [pii]', '10.1074/mcp.M800256-MCP200 [doi]']",20081110,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'BB/C511356/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G0601056/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/C515771/1/BB_/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'MC_U117527252/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC2667343,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation from an HLA-compatible sibling should be performed in first complete remission: 1) in children with intermediate-high risk cytogenetics or who achieved first complete remission after the second course of therapy; 2) in adults less than 40 years with an intermediate-risk; in those aged less than 55 years with either high-risk cytogenetics or who achieved first complete remission after the second course of therapy. Stem cell transplantation from an unrelated donor is recommended to be performed in first complete remission in adults 30 years old or younger, and in children with very high-risk disease lacking a sibling donor. Alternative donor stem cell transplantation is an option in high-risk patients without a matched donor who urgently need transplantation. Patients aged less than 60 years, who either are not candidate for allogeneic stem cell transplantation or lack a donor, are candidates for autologous stem cell transplantation. We describe the results of a systematic literature review and an explicit approach to consensus techniques, which resulted in recommendations for the management of primary non-APL acute myeloid leukemia.","[""Division of Hematology, Niguarda Ca'Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy. enrica.morra@ospedaleniguarda.it""]","['haematol.13166 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13166 [doi]']",20081110,,PMC2625406,,['Haematologica. 2009 Jan;94(1):10-6.

However, the status of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones in various categories of myelodysplastic syndrome and in other bone marrow disorders is not well-studied. DESIGN AND METHODS: By using multiparameter flow cytometry immunophenotypic analysis with antibodies specific for four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (CD55, CD59, CD16, CD66b) and performing an aerolysin lysis confirmatory test in representative cases, we assessed the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-phenotype granulocytes in 110 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, 15 with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease, 5 with idiopathic myelofibrosis and 6 with acute myeloid leukemia. RESULTS: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-phenotype granulocytes were detected in nine patients with low grade myelodysplastic syndrome who showed clinicopathological features of bone marrow failure, similar to aplastic anemia. All paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria-positive cases demonstrated loss of the four glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, with CD16(-)CD66b(-) clones being larger than those of CD55(-)CD59(-) (p<0.05). Altered glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein expression secondary to granulocytic hypogranulation, immaturity, and/or immunophenotypic abnormalities was present in a substantial number of cases and diagnostically challenging. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that routine screening for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones in patients with an intrinsic bone marrow disease who show no clinical evidence of hemolysis has an appreciable yield in patients with low grade myelodysplastic syndromes. The recognition of diagnostic caveats and pitfalls associated with the underlying intrinsic bone marrow disease is essential in interpreting paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria testing correctly. In our experience, the CD16/CD66b antibody combination is superior to CD55/CD59 in screening for subclinical paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria because it detects a large clone size and is less subject to analytical interference.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA. swang5@mdanderson.org']","['haematol.13601 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.13601 [doi]']",20081110,,PMC2625410,,['Haematologica. 2009 Jan;94(1):3-7.

This antigen is encoded by a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the B cell lineage-specific CD19 gene, which is an important target antigen for immunotherapy of most B cell malignancies. The CD19(L)-encoded antigen was identified using a novel and powerful genetic strategy in which zygosity-genotype correlation scanning was used as the key step for fine mapping the genetic locus defined by pairwise linkage analysis. This strategy was also applicable for genome-wide identification of a wide range of mHags. CD19(L)-specific CD4(+) T cells provided antigen-specific help for maturation of dendritic cells and for expansion of CD8(+) mHag-specific T cells.

We report here that selective deletion of Shp2, an SH2-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase, in striated muscle results in severe dilated cardiomyopathy in mice, leading to heart failure and premature mortality. Development of cardiomyopathy in this mouse model is coupled with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and impaired glucose uptake in striated muscle cells. Shp2 deficiency leads to upregulation of leukemia inhibitory factor-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt, Erk5, and Stat3 pathways in cardiomyocytes. Insulin resistance and impaired glucose uptake in Shp2-deficient mice are at least in part due to impaired protein kinase C-zeta/lambda and AMP-kinase activities in striated muscle. Thus, we have generated a mouse line modeling human patients suffering from cardiomyopathy and insulin resistance. This study reinforces a concept that a compound disease with multiple cardiovascular and metabolic disturbances can be caused by a defect in a single molecule such as Shp2, which modulates multiple signaling pathways initiated by cytokines and hormones.","['Burnham Institute for Medical Research, 10901 N.

Activating Notch1-mutations, leading to aberrant downstream signaling, have been identified in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). While this highlights the contribution of Notch signaling to T-ALL pathogenesis, the mechanisms by which Notch regulates proliferation and survival in normal and leukemic T cells are not fully understood. Our findings identify a role for Notch signaling in G(1)-S progression of cell cycle in T cells. Here we show that expression of the G(1) proteins, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6, is Notch-dependent both in vitro and in vivo, and we outline a possible mechanism for the regulated expression of cyclin D3 in activated T cells via CSL (CBF-1, mammals; suppressor of hairless, Drosophila melanogaster; Lag-1, Caenorhabditis elegans), as well as a noncanonical Notch signaling pathway. While cyclin D3 expression contributes to cell-cycle progression in Notch-dependent human T-ALL cell lines, ectopic expression of CDK4 or CDK6 together with cyclin D3 shows partial rescue from gamma-secretase inhibitor (GSI)-induced G(1) arrest in these cell lines. Importantly, cyclin D3 and CDK4 are highly overexpressed in Notch-dependent T-cell lymphomas, justifying the combined use of cell-cycle inhibitors and GSI in treating human T-cell malignancies.","['Program in Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA 01003, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)37671-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-147967 [doi]']",20081110,"['P01 AG025531/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA119070-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI049361/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2647664,,['Blood. 2009 Feb 19;113(8):1615-6.

The first aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the MTX serum concentration and occurrence of oral mucositis in pediatric ALL patients. The second aim was to clarify the relationship between MTX exposure and epidermal keratinocyte cell injury using an in vitro study. METHODS: 49 patients were treated according to the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS) ALL-HR02 protocol. This protocol involves HD-MTX treatment (3 g/m2 for 24-h i.v. infusion). The MTX serum concentrations were measured by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay. The relationship between oral mucositis and MTX serum concentrations 48 and 72 h after administration was determined. The cell toxicity of MTX for human epidermal keratinocytes was analyzed by using a cell viability assay (WST-1 assay). In addition, pharmacokinetic evaluation for clearance, AUC extrapolated from 48 h to infinity (AUC48h-inf) and elimination half-life (t1/2b) were done using the 1-compartmental models. RESULTS: Oral mucositis occurred in 24 patients (49.0%), in whom 20 patients (83.3% in oral mucositis group) showed WHO severity Grade 1 or 2. Only 4 patients (16.7% in oral mucositis group) showed Grade 3 severity. 22 patients (44.9%) had oral mucositis in the group with a concentration under 10-6 M 48 h after MTX administration. There was no significant deference among the cell viabilities in the concentrations of 10-6 M, 10-5 M and 10-4 M 48 h after the MTX exposure. However, the cell viability obtained 24 h after the MTX exposure was significantly different from the respective cell viability 48, 72 and 96 h after the MTX exposure. In the group with oral mucositis, the clearance decreased significantly (p = 0.042), and the t1/2b (p = 0.025) and AUC48h- yen (p = 0.025) increased significantly compared with the non-symptom group. CONCLUSIONS: It seems that there is no significant relationship between the serum MTX concentration and oral mucositis. This in vitro study has demonstrated that the cell injury was related to the duration of MTX exposure rather than a high MTX concentration.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, Shujitsu University, Okayama, Japan.']",['10.5414/cpp46584 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was to investigate the antitumor effect of low-frequency ultrasound combined with adriamycin on human leukemia multidrug resistance (MDR) cell line K562/A02. METHODS: K562/A02 cells were divided into four groups: blank control group, adriamycin group, ultrasound group, and adriamycin plus ultrasound group. The trypan blue dye exclusion assay and MTT assay were used to determine the viability and proliferation of K562/A02 cells, while Wright's stain and flow cytometry were used to determine the apoptosis and the concentration of adriamycin. The expression of P-glycoproteins (P-gp) was detected using immunocytochemistry. RESULTS: Ultrasound (20 kHz, 0.25 W/cm2, 60s) combined with adriamycin (7.5 microg/mL) induced more apoptosis of K562/A02 cells than adriamycin alone. Compared with the adriamycin group, ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz and an intensity of 0.5 W/cm2 exerted an acute killing effect on cells. Ultrasound increased the intracellular concentration of adriamycin and promoted apoptosis of K562/A02 cells, but did not change the expression of P-gp on the cell membrane. CONCLUSION: Ultrasound at a frequency of 20 kHz, an intensity of 0.25 W/cm2 and duration of 60s can enhance the killing effect of adriamycin on K562/A02 cells.","['Department of Hematology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['1000-467X2008111182 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GC-resistance may be overcome in T and B lymphoid malignancies by inhibiting the JNK, Src, PI3K, Akt or mTOR survival pathways. Both staurosporine and rapamycin have recently been proved efficient to sensitize resistant T and B malignant cells to GC-induced apoptosis.

Twenty-three patients (mean age 44.5+/-10.6 years, 15 males) with acute leukemia were studied. All biomarkers were measured the day before PR, the day after PR, the day after HCT and 14 days after HCT. We found NT-proBNP elevations above 500 ng/L in 6 (26.1 %) patients after PR, in 9 (39.1 %) after HCT and in 7 (30.4 %) 14 days after HCT. GPBB became elevated (above 7.30 microg/L) in 5 (21.7 %) patients after PR, remained elevated in 5 (21.7 %) after HCT and in 2 (8.7 %) 14 days after HCT. A significant correlation between elevation in NT-proBNP and GPBB was found. Other markers remained within the reference range early after PR and HCT. Our findings show that administration of PR and HCT for acute leukemia is associated with acute neurohumoral activation of cardiac dysfunction (significant rise in NT-proBNP) and may lead to GPBB elevation. These changes could indicate acute cardiac toxicity due to treatment and require further follow-up. The predictive value for development of cardiomyopathy in the future is unclear.

METHODS: We analyzed the types, causes, treatment and prognosis of 15 cases of priapism. The patients ranged in age from 20 to 66 (mean 46) years, their erection lasting 10-172 (mean 28.4) hours. Among them, 6 cases resulted from in taking vaso-active agents, 1 had transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder metastasized to the penis, 2 had leukemia, 3 had a traumatic history and the other 3 had unknown causes. RESULTS: Of the total number, 12 fell into the ischemic low-flow type and 3 the non-ischemic high-flow type. Follow-up lasted 1-26 months. In the 12 cases of the ischemic low-flow type, 7 were cured by 2-6 mg metaraminol injection at the root of the cavernous body and, when necessary, the perfusion of heparinized saline at the glans and the root of the cavernous body of the penis, and 2 achieved detumescence after glandular cavernosal shunting. The 2 cases caused by leukemia and 1 by metastasis of transitional cell carcinoma underwent penectomy, but with unfavorable prognosis. Of the 3 high-flow type cases, 1 was cured by selective embolization of the internal pudendal artery and the other 2 discharged after conservative treatment, but developed ED on follow-up. CONCLUSION: Cavernous blood gas analysis and color duplex ultrasonography are helpful to the accurate and timely diagnosis of priapism. Cavernosal decompression and intracavernosal injection of aramine can be applied to most of the patients. If conservative treatment fails to achieve detumescence of the penis, surgery should be performed immediately for both types of priapism.","['Department of Urology, Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, Shenyang, Liaoning 110004, China. s19801206@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to get an insight into the mechanisms of toxicity of the novel explosives NTO (5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-one) and ANTA (5-nitro-1,2,4-triazol-3-amine), we examined their reactions with the single-electron transferring flavoenzymes NADPH: cytochrome P-450 reductase and ferredoxin:NADP+ reductase, two-electron transferring flavoenzymes mammalian NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (DT-diaphorase), and Enterobacter cloacae NAD(P)H:nitroreductase, and their reactions with oxyhemoglobin. The reactivity of NTO and ANTA in the above reactions was markedly lower than that of TNT. The toxicity of NTO and ANTA in bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) was partly prevented by desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and potentiated by 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea. This points to the involvement of oxidative stress in their cytotoxicity, presumably to the redox cycling of free radicals. The FLK cell line cytotoxicity and the methemoglobin formation in isolated human erythrocytes of NTO and ANTA were also markedly lower than those of TNT, and similar to those of nitrobenzene. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the low toxicity of nitrotriazole explosives may be attributed to their low electron-accepting properties.","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['10.1515/znc-2004-5-620 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these applications of C. purpurea have not been supported by pharmacological investigation. The objective of this study is to investigate the anticancer activities of three main constituents such as santamarine, 9beta-acetoxycostunolide and 9beta-acetoxyparthenolide isolated from C. purpurea in vitro. METHODS: Cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion and methylene blue assays. Colony formation was assessed by microtitration cloning assay. DNA synthesis was determined by tritiated thymidine incorporation assay. Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was observed by DAPI staining assay and Caspase 3/7 activities was measured using Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit. RESULTS: Santamarine, 9beta-acetoxycostunolide and 9beta-acetoxyparthenolide inhibited the growth of L1210 murine leukaemia, CCRF-CEM human leukaemia, KB human nasopharyngeal carcinoma, LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma and MCF 7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells in vitro, with IC(50) in the range of 0.16-1.3 microg/mL. In L1210 model, santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide inhibited L1210 cell growth, colony formation and [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation in time- and concentration-dependent manners. Flow cytometry studies showed that santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide blocked L1210 cells in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle. DAPI staining and caspase activity assays showed santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide induced apoptosis and activated caspase 3 in L1210 cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that santamarine, 9beta-acetoxycostunolide and 9beta-acetoxyparthenolide exhibit significant anticancer activities in vitro. The inhibitory effects of santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide on L1210 cells are cytotoxic rather than just cytostatic. They block mitosis and reduce uptake of thymidine. The mechanism of the cytotoxicity of santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide to L1210 cells could be related to alkylation of the sulfhydryl enzymes involved in nucleic acids and protein synthesis, as previously found for other sesquiterpenes with the alpha-methylene-gamma-lactone moiety present in santamarine, 9beta-acetoxycostunolide and 9beta-acetoxyparthenolide. It may also be related to suppression of microtubular proteins. Santamarine and 9beta-acetoxycostunolide induced apoptosis of L1210 cells via activation of caspase 3.","['Faculty of Pharmacy, The University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia. gyma@olemiss.edu']",['10.1007/s00280-008-0863-y [doi]'],20081109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a retrospective study comparing the efficacy of mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, prednisone, doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine (MOPPABV) versus adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) chemotherapy protocols as first-line therapy for HL in a Brazilian population. A hundred and eighty-six HL patients were retrospectively analyzed regarding their first-line treatment with MOPPABV and ABVD at two public hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Eligible patients were either previously untreated or at first relapse after being treated with only radiotherapy with confirmed HL diagnosis. At a median follow-up of 9 years, complete remission is 89.5 and 85.9 (P = 0.3), overall survival 93.8% and 89.6% (P = 0.68), disease-free survival 85.6% and 81.6% (P = 0.41), and relapse ratios 20.9% and 26.4% (P = 0.17) for ABVD and MOPPABV, respectively. Extended-field radiation therapy postchemotherapy was mostly used in the MOPPABV group. There were three cases of secondary neoplasm (colon adenocarcinoma, myeloid chronic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), all associated with MOPPABV. ABVD and MOPPABV protocols as first-line treatment for HL resulted in similar therapeutic outcomes and did not influence overall survival, disease-free survival, and relapse ratio. MOPPABV was related to a higher risk of secondary malignancy and, therefore, ABVD should be considered a better option for HL therapy. These findings corroborate recent data in literature.","['Departamento de Oncologia Clinica e Experimental, Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.']",['10.1007/s00277-008-0635-0 [doi]'],20081108,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because the truncated isoform of protein-tyrosine phosphatase receptor-type O (PTPROt) is specifically expressed in hematopoietic cells, we tested the possibility that it could potentially dephosphorylate and inactivate the fusion protein bcr/abl. Ectopic expression of PTPROt in the chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 indeed resulted in hypophosphorylation of bcr/abl and reduced phosphorylation of its downstream targets CrkL and Stat5, confirming that PTPROt could inactivate the function of bcr/abl. Furthermore, the expression of catalytically active PTPROt in K562 cells caused reduced proliferation, delayed transition from G0/G1 to S phase, loss of anchorage independent growth, inhibition of ex vivo tumor growth, and increased their susceptibility to apoptosis, affirming that this tyrosine phosphatase can revert the transformation potential of bcr/abl. Additionally, the catalytically inactive PTPROt acted as a trapping mutant that was also able to inhibit anchorage independence and facilitate apoptosis of K562 cells. The inhibitory action of PTPROt on bcr/abl was also confirmed in a murine myeloid cell line overexpressing bcr/abl. PTPROt expression was suppressed in K562 cells and was relieved upon treatment of the cells with 5-azacytidine, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, with concomitant hypomethylation of the PTPRO CpG island. These data demonstrate that suppression of PTPROt by promoter methylation could contribute to the augmented phosphorylation and constitutive activity of its substrate bcr/abl and provide a potentially significant molecular therapeutic target for bcr/abl-positive leukemia.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210; Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, the Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210.

However, the identity and nature of clinically relevant LAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations have proven difficult to define. Here, we used a combination of coreceptor-mutated peptide-major histocompatibility complex class I (pMHCI) tetramers and polychromatic flow cytometry to examine the avidity profiles, phenotypic characteristics, and anatomical distribution of HLA A*0201-restricted CD8(+) T-cell populations specific for LAAs that are over-expressed in myeloid leukemias. Remarkably, LAA-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations, regardless of fine specificity, were confined almost exclusively to the bone marrow; in contrast, CD8(+) T-cell populations specific for the HLA A*0201-restricted cytomegalovirus (CMV) pp65(495-503) epitope were phenotypically distinct and evenly distributed between bone marrow and peripheral blood. Furthermore, bone marrow-resident LAA-specific CD8(+) T cells frequently engaged cognate antigen with high avidity; notably, this was the case in all tested bone marrow samples derived from patients who achieved clinical remission after HSCT. These data suggest that concomitant examination of bone marrow specimens in patients with myeloid leukemias might yield more definitive information in the search for immunologic prognosticators of clinical outcome.","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. melenhoj@nhlbi.nih.gov']","['S0006-4971(20)37606-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-151969 [doi]']",20081107,"['G0501963/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Z99 AI999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2652369,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this beneficial effect is considered to be frequently offset by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Thus, improving HSCT outcomes by separating GVL from GVHD is a key clinical issue. This cohort study registered 4643 patients with hematologic malignancies who received transplants from unrelated donors. Six major human leukocyte antigen (HLA) loci were retrospectively genotyped. We identified 4 HLA-Cw and 6 HLA-DPB1 mismatch combinations responsible for a decreased risk of relapse; of these, 8 of 10 combinations were different from those responsible for severe acute GVHD, including all 6 of the HLA-DPB1 combinations. Pairs with these combinations of HLA-DPB1 were associated with a significantly better overall survival than were completely matched pairs. Moreover, several amino acid substitutions on specific positions responsible for a decreased risk of relapse were identified in HLA-Cw, but not in HLA-DPB1. These findings might be crucial to elucidating the mechanism of the decreased risk of relapse on the basis of HLA molecule. Donor selection made in consideration of these results might allow the separation of GVL from acute GVHD, especially in HLA-DPB1 mismatch combinations.","['Division of Epidemiology and Prevention, Aichi Cancer Center, Nagoya, Japan.']","['S0006-4971(20)37552-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-171934 [doi]']",20081107,,,,,,,['Japan Marrow Donor Program'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a reproducible, quantitative genotyping method and stringent criteria for scoring ASE, we found that 16% of the analyzed genes display ASE in multiple ALL cell samples. For most of the genes, the level of ASE varied largely between the samples, from 1.4-fold overexpression of one allele to apparent monoallelic expression. For genes exhibiting ASE, 55% displayed bidirectional ASE in which overexpression of either of the two SNP alleles occurred. For bidirectional ASE we also observed overall higher levels of ASE and correlation with the methylation level of these sites.

Data on leukemia mortality and occupational exposure to benzene among rubber hydrochloride production workers in Ohio (1940-1996) were analyzed by using this approach. A model in which benzene exposure increased clonal expansion fit these data well; little evidence of an association between benzene exposure and initiation of leukemia was found. The estimated exposure-response association increased in magnitude with age at exposure and decreased with time since exposure. This analysis shows that the 2-stage clonal expansion model can be readily fit to epidemiologic cohort data by using a simple SAS program. The illustrative analyses of leukemia mortality among rubber hydrochloride workers suggest that the effect of benzene on leukemia risk is due to an exposure-induced increase in the proliferation of initiated cells.","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599, USA. david.richardson@unc.edu']","['kwn284 [pii]', '10.1093/aje/kwn284 [doi]']",20081106,['K01-OH008635/OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When expressed in K562 cells known to constitutively secrete exosomes, the chimera was found to be very efficiently targeted to the released vesicles. Very interestingly, the cytosolic domain of the Env protein contains peptide motifs potentially recognized by components of the ESCRT machinery that could be related to chimera sorting into the vesicles. Then, quantifying the chimera secretion, we investigated the site of exosome biogenesis in K562 cells using a pharmacological approach.

In this study, human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells were used to elucidate the mechanism and death mode associated with PAT. Morphological evidence of apoptosis, including membrane blebbing, nuclei fragmentation and DNA laddering formation was clearly observed 6h after exposure to PAT. The results of Western blotting indicated that PAT activated various processed caspases, and cleaved DFF45 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in a dose-dependent manner; it also induced a time-dependent increase in caspase 3 and 9 catalytic activities. The apoptosis mediated by PAT in HL-60 was accompanied with cytochrome c release from mitochondria and Bcl-2 expression decrease. The presence of thiol-containing compounds with PAT dramatically reduced the caspase 3 activity that was triggered by PAT; the addition of antioxidants, including mannitol and Tiron, had a similar effect. However, the suppression of p53 protein expression by RNA interference (RNAi) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells did not significantly modify PAT-elicited caspase 3 activity. These findings suggest that PAT-induced apoptosis is mediated through the mitochondrial pathway without the involvement of p53; the interaction with sulfhydryl groups of macromolecules by PAT and the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a primary role in the apoptotic process.","['Institute of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']","['S0378-4274(08)01282-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.toxlet.2008.09.018 [doi]']",20081101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the accumulating knowledge of the molecular biology of HTLV-I-infected cells, effective therapeutic strategies remain to be established. Recent reports showed that the hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor statins have anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on certain tumor cells through inhibition of protein prenylation. Here, we report that statins hinder the survival of ATL cells and induce apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is responsible for these effects, since simultaneous treatment with isoprenoid precursors, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or farnesyl pyrophosphate, but not a cholesterol precursor squalene, restored the viability of ATL cells. Simvastatin inhibited geranylgeranylation of small GTPases Rab5B and Rac1 in ATL cells, and a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor GGTI-298 reduced ATL cell viability more efficiently than a farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277.

The aims of this study were to assess the HRQOL in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients in Indonesia and to assess the influence of demographic and medical characteristics on HRQOL. METHODS: After cultural linguistic validation, a cross-sectional study of HRQOL was conducted with childhood ALL patients and their guardians in various phases of treatment using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 4.0 Generic Core Scale and the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) 3.0 Cancer Module. RESULTS: Ninety-eight guardians and 55 patients participated. The internal consistency of both scales ranged from 0.57 to 0.92. HRQOL of Indonesian patients was comparable with those in developed countries. There were moderate to good correlations between self-reports and proxy-reports, however guardians tended to report worse HRQOL than patients. Children of the 2-5 year-group significantly had more problems in procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety and communication subscales than in older groups (p < 0.05). In the non-intensive phase HRQOL was significantly better than in the intensive phase, both in patient self-reports and proxy-reports. CONCLUSION: Younger children had more problems in procedural anxiety, treatment anxiety and communication subscales. Therefore, special care during intervention procedures is needed to promote their normal development. Psychosocial support should be provided to children and their parents to facilitate their coping with disease and its treatment.","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Gadjah Mada University, Yogyakarta, Indonesia. msitaresmi@yahoo.com']","['1477-7525-6-96 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7525-6-96 [doi]']",20081109,,PMC2613134,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have verified that these chemicals have effects in fertility (abortions, sterility); produce various upheavals, such as dizziness, nausea, muscular pain; and produce chromosomal damage at the DNA level, which in the long or medium run, can develop into cancer and leukemia. The genetic damage in exposed individuals was measured by means of the comet test, chromosomal alterations test, and the study of the CYP 1A1 and MSH2 genes. These methods were applied to determine the genotoxicity of hydrocarbons and their residue in human beings. When conducting these tests on the blood samples of individuals exposed to hydrocarbons (workers of oil companies) and of a control population of the area of study and Quito, it was found that, in effect, the exposed individuals presented a greater amount of damage at the DNA level as well as at the chromosomal level than the individuals from the control populations (P< 0.001). Thus, it can be determined that populations that are exposed to hydrocarbons are susceptible to developing genetic damage.

Notch1 mutations are the most common ones in T acute lymphoblastic leukaemia patients which carry either oncogenic Notch1 forms or ineffective ubiquitin ligase implicated in Notch1 turnover. Abnormalities in the Notch1-Jagged1 system have been reported also in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) patients where Jagged1 is frequently over-expressed. Moreover, activating Notch1 mutations, as well, can occur in human AML and in leukemia cases with lineage infidelity. As a result, Notch1 signalling inhibition is an attractive goal in leukaemia therapy. Blockage/delay in cell differentiation and/or increase of proliferation are the main results of Notch1 signalling activation in several leukemic cell lines. Moreover, specific genes involved in cell growth control have been identified as Notch1 transcriptional targets, i.e. Cyclin D1 and c-Myc. 4-Hydroxynonenal (HNE), an aldehyde produced during lipid peroxidation, is involved in several pathological and physiological conditions, including inflammation; atherosclerosis; and neurodegenerative and chronic liver diseases. Moreover HNE has an antiproliferative/ differentiative effect in several cell lines, by affecting the expression of key genes, such as oncogenes (e.g. c-Myc, c-Myb), cyclins and telomerase. This prompted us to study the effect of HNE on Notch1 expression and its related signalling in HL-60 cells, a leukemic cell line widely used for differentiation studies. RT-PCR as well as Western blot assay showed Notch1down-regulation in HNE-treated HL-60 cells. The expression of Hes1, a Notch1 target gene, was concomitantly down-regulated by HNE treatment, reflecting Notch1 signalling inhibition. DAPT, an inhibitor of Notch activity, when added contemporary to HNE, further increased cell growth inhibition, without affecting apoptosis. Moreover, DAPT treatment reversed the HNE-induced differentiation. Overall these results suggest that Notch1 is a target for HNE and its down regulation is a key event in HNE-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation in the HL-60 cell line. By contrast our data do not support a role for Notch1 in HNE- induced differentiation or apoptosis.","['Department of Medicine and Ecperimental Pathology, University of Torino, Torino, Italy. stefania.pizzimenti@unito.it']",['10.2174/157340608786242098 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An extensive survey of human hematopoietic tissues disclosed that FCRL6 expression by NK- and T-cell subpopulations increases as a function of differentiation and is remarkably restricted to mature lymphocytes with cytotoxic capability. In particular, FCRL6 distinguishes perforin-expressing CD56dim NK cells, Vdelta1+ and Vdelta2+ gammadelta T cells, effector and effector memory CD8+ T cells, and rare cytotoxic CD4+ T cells in adult tissues. Analysis of this receptor in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was also performed. FCRL6 was found to mark significantly expanded populations of cytotoxic CD8+ T, CD4+ T, and NK cells in patients with CLL.

Initially, to determine whether the magnetic nanoparticle Fe3O4 and Au can facilitate the anticancer drug to reverse the resistance of cancer cells, we have explored the cytotoxic effect of daunomycin (DNR) with and without the magnetic nano-Fe3O4 or nano-Au on K562 and K562/A02 cells by MTT assay. Besides, the intracellular DNR concentration and apoptosis of the K562/A02 cells was further investigated by flow cytometry and confocal fluorescence microscopic studies. The MDR1 gene expression of the K562/A02 cells was also studied by RT-PCR method. Our results indicate that 5.0 x 10(-7) M nano-Fe3O4 or 2.0 x 10(-8) M nano-Au is biocompatible and can apparently raise the intracellular DNR accumulation of the K562/A02 cells and increase the apoptosis of tumor cells. Moreover, our observations illustrate that although these two kinds of nanoparticles themselves could not lower the MDRI gene expression of the K562/A02 cells, yet they could degrade the MDR1 gene level when combining with anticancer drug DNR. This raises the possibility to combine the nano-Fe3O4 or nano-Au with DNR to reverse the drug resistance of K562/A02 cells, which could offer a new strategy for the promising efficient chemotherapy of the leukemia patients.","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Zhongda Hospital of Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, P.R.

We have previously demonstrated that elevated glucose metabolism characteristic of stimulated or cancerous cells can stabilize the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein Mcl-1 through inhibition of GSK-3. Here we show that the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Puma, is also metabolically regulated. Growth factor deprivation led to the loss of glucose uptake and induction of Puma. Maintenance of glucose uptake after growth factor withdrawal by expression of the glucose transporter, Glut1, however, suppressed Puma up-regulation and attenuated growth factor withdrawal-induced activation of Bax, DNA fragmentation, and cell death. Conversely, glucose deprivation led to Puma induction even in the presence of growth factor. This regulation of Puma expression was a central component in cell death as a consequence of growth factor or glucose deprivation because Puma deficiency suppressed both of these cell death pathways. Puma induction in growth factor or glucose withdrawal was dependent on p53 in cell lines and in activated primary T lymphocytes because p53 deficiency suppressed Puma induction and delayed Bax and caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and loss of clonogenic survival. Importantly, although p53 levels did not change or were slightly reduced, p53 activity was suppressed by elevated glucose metabolism to inhibit Puma induction after growth factor withdrawal. These data show that p53 is metabolically regulated and that glucose metabolism initiates a signaling mechanism to inhibit p53 activation and suppress Puma induction, thus promoting an anti-apoptotic balance to Bcl-2 family protein expression that supports cell survival.","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Sarah W.

A randomized trial, Radiation Therapy Oncology Group trial 9902, was undertaken to determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, estramustine, and etoposide (TEE) plus AS+RT would improve disease outcomes with acceptable toxicity. METHODS AND MATERIALS: High-risk (prostate-specific antigen 20-100 ng/mL and Gleason score >or=7; or Stage T2 or greater, Gleason score 8, prostate-specific antigen level <100 ng/mL) nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients were randomized to AS+RT (Arm 1) vs. AS+RT plus four cycles of TEE (Arm 2). TEE was delivered 4 weeks after RT. AS continued for 2 years for both treatment arms. RT began after 8 weeks of AS began. RESULTS: The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 9902 trial opened January 11, 2000. Excess thromboembolic toxicity was noted, leading to study closure October 4, 2004. A total of 397 patients were accrued, and the data for 381 were analyzable. An acute and long-term toxicity analysis was performed. The worst overall toxicities during treatment were increased for Arm 2. Of the 192 patients, 136 (71%) on Arm 2 had RTOG Grade 3 or greater toxicity compared with 70 (37%) of 189 patients on Arm 1. Statistically significant increases in hematologic toxicity (p < 0.0001) and gastrointestinal toxicity (p = 0.017) but not genitourinary toxicity (p = 0.07) were noted during treatment. Two Grade 5 complications related to neutropenic infection occurred in Arm 2. Three cases of myelodysplasia/acute myelogenous leukemia were noted in Arm 2. At 2 and 3 years after therapy completion, excess long-term toxicity was not observed in Arm 2. CONCLUSION: TEE was associated with significantly increased toxicity during treatment. The toxicity profiles did not differ at 2 and 3 years after therapy. Toxicity is an important consideration in the design of trials using adjuvant chemotherapy for prostate cancer.","['Radiation Oncology Center, Radiological Associates of Sacramento, Sacramento, CA 95815, USA. rosenthals@radiological.com']","['S0360-3016(08)00845-6 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.05.020 [doi]']",20081105,"['U10 CA21661/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA32115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA37422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Trial 9902'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This increase in expression is transcriptionally regulated. The function of HSPs is similar in virtually all living organisms, from bacteria to humans. Their expression also occur under non-stressful conditions, simply 'monitoring' the cell's proteins, i.e., they carry old proteins to the cell's 'recycling bin' and they help newly synthesized proteins fold properly. These activities are part of a cell's own repair system. HSPs are molecular chaperones for protein molecules. They are usually cytoplasmic proteins and they perform functions in various intracellular processes. Tumour-derived HSP-peptide complexes (HSPPCs) can be used for vaccination against malignancies. In particular, HSPPC-96 complex, called Vitespen (formerly Oncophage) is a HSPs-based vaccine made from individual patients' tumours with a promising role in cancer management. This vaccine has been extensively studied in Phase I and II clinical trials, showing activity on different malignancies, including gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic myelogenous leukaemia. The vaccine has also been studied in Phase III clinical trials in melanoma and kidney cancer, showing an excellent safety profile with essentially no toxicity. Thus, HSP-based vaccines are a novel therapeutic approach with a promising role in cancer management.","['Division of Melanoma and Musculo-Cutaneous Sarcomas, IEO-European Institute of Oncology, 435, Via Giuseppe Ripamonti, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",['10.1517/14712590802517970 [doi]'],,,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Management of IA is expensive, which makes prevention desirable. Because hospital resources are limited, prevention costs have to be compared with treatment costs and outcome. METHODS: In 269 patients treated for acute myelogenous leukemia-myelodysplastic syndrome (AML-MDS) during 2002-2007, evidence of IA was collected using high-resolution computed tomography and galactomannan measurement in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens. IA was classified on the basis of updated European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycoses Study Group definitions. Outcome of infection was registered. Diagnostic and therapeutic IA-related costs, corrected for neutropenia duration, were comprehensively analyzed from a hospital perspective. Voriconazole treatment was given orally from day 1 if possible. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients developed IA; 48 (18%) had probable or proven infection, and 32 (12%) had possible IA. Seventy-three patients were treated with voriconazole; 55 (75%) took oral voriconazole from day 1. In patients with IA, the mortality rate 12 weeks after starting antifungal therapy was 22% (16 of 73 patients). The overall mortality rate, registered 12 weeks after neutrophil recovery from the last dose of antileukemic treatment, was 26% in patients with IA versus 16% in patients without IA (P = .08), reflecting an IA-attributable mortality rate of 10%. In a Cox regression analysis, IA was associated with an increased mortality risk (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-4.4). Total IA-related costs increased to euro 8360 and euro 15,280 for patients with possible and probable or proven IA, respectively, compared with patients without IA (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Early diagnosis and treatment of IA with oral voriconazole result in acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, IA continues to have substantial attributable mortality combined with a major impact on hospital resource use, so effective prevention in high-incidence populations has the potential to save lives and costs.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['10.1086/591531 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factors influencing the treatment and outcome of pediatric ALL with high-risk features in developing countries have not been well studied. METHODS: High-risk features were defined as: age <1 year or >10 years, white blood cell (WBC) > 50 x 10(9)/L, CNS or testicular involvement at diagnosis, T-ALL, BCR-ABL/MLL-AF4, poor prednisone response, slow early response to induction chemotherapy which was defined as M3 status (>25% blasts) on day 15 bone marrow with age >6 years or presenting WBC > 20 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis and/or non-remission (NR) after 33 days of induction therapy. RESULTS: Ninety-one children were analyzed. The total rate of treatment abandonment was 24.2% and treatment-related mortality was 3.3% (3/91). The event-free survival (EFS) was 52.3% (95% CI, 41.5-63.1%) at 4 years and 49.9% (95% CI, 38.9-60.9%) at 8 years, respectively. When the cases who abandoned treatment were excluded, the EFS of the remainder was 68.3% (95% CI, 56.5-80.1%) at 4 years and 65.2% (95% CI, 52.5-77.9%) at 8 years, respectively. NR on day 33 or BCR-ABL remained as an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in the Cox model even if more intense chemotherapy was administrated. CONCLUSION: A decreased treatment-related death frequency was associated with an improved outcome of leukemia. This emphasizes the importance of improving supportive care in developing countries for children with high-risk ALL who receive very intensive chemotherapy. Treatment abandonment remains a prominent reason for treatment failure in China.","['Department of Pediatrics, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University, Zhongshan Er Lu, Guangzhou, China. l-xuequn@126.com']",['10.1002/pbc.21810 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients with localized high-risk prostate cancer were treated with 4 cycles (16 weeks) of continuous weekly paclitaxel at 80 mg/m(2) intravenously with estramustine at 280 mg orally 3 times a day for 5 days a week and carboplatin (area under the curve of 6) on Day 1 of every cycle followed by 3-dimensional conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (total dose of 77.4 gray [Gy] in 1.8-Gy fractions). All patients received androgen deprivation therapy with either goserelin acetate at 3.6 mg subcutaneously or leuprolide acetate at 7.5 mg intramuscularly monthly for 6 months starting at Day 1 of therapy. Patients were evaluated for acute and late toxicities along with progression-free survival and time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) failure associated with the multimodality therapy. RESULTS: Twenty-seven of 34 patients completed therapy and were evaluable for safety and feasibility. There was 1 patient with grade 3 nausea during chemotherapy. No other grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or genitourinary acute or late toxicities were reported. The most common grade 1 to 2 late toxicities were proctitis (11%), dysuria (11%), and urinary frequency/urgency (33%). Two deaths due to prostate cancer were observed. Median follow-up was 38 months among 24 surviving patients; median PSA progression-free survival was 12.1 months (95% confidence interval, 13.3-25.9).

As most childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia treatment protocols include up to 13 different chemotherapeutic agents, the impact of individual SNPs has been difficult to evaluate. So far focus has mainly been on the widely used glucocorticosteroids, methotrexate, and thiopurines, or on metabolic pathways and transport mechanisms that are common to several drugs, such as the glutathione S-transferases. However, beyond the thiopurine methyltransferase polymorphisms, the candidate-gene approach has not established clear associations between polymorphisms and treatment response. In the future, high-throughput, low-cost, genetic platforms will allow screening of hundreds or thousands of targeted SNPs to give a combined gene-dosage effect (=individual SNP risk profile), which may allow pharmacogenetic-based individualization of treatment.","['Pediatric Clinic II, The Juliane Marie Centre, The University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e3181868570 [doi]', '00043426-200811000-00009 [pii]']",,,,,,217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mean daily energy intake was consistent with estimated requirements; however, mean body mass index was 27.1 kg/m2 (overweight). Dietary index scores averaged fewer than half the possible number of points on all 3 scales, indicating poor adherence to recommended guidelines. No study participant reported complete adherence to any set of guidelines. Although half the participants met minimal daily goals for 5 servings of fruits and vegetables (WCRF/AICR recommendations) and <or=30% of energy as dietary fat (DASH diet and USDA Food Guide), participants reported dietary sodium and added sugar intake considerably in excess of recommendations, and suboptimal consumption of whole grains. Guideline adherence was not associated with either body mass index or waist circumference, perhaps due to the low dietary index scores.

METHODS: We used a model in which ""complicated childhood cancers"" were grouped into 1 category, after identifying a set of potentially influential illness complication variables. This category included central nervous system tumors, acute myeloid leukemia, and bone tumors. Parental distress in that category (n=144) was compared with distress after acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=177) in the child. In addition, comparisons were made between parents of the specific diagnosis groups. A multidimensional questionnaire assessing symptoms of distress was used. RESULTS: Parents in the complicated cancer category showed significantly heightened disease-related fear, anxiety, depression, loss of control, late effects-related uncertainty, and poorer self-esteem compared with parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Significantly heightened parental distress was associated with the child having been treated with cranial irradiation. CONCLUSIONS: Relatively heightened distress in parents of children with complicated cancer is influenced by diagnosis-related factors like an intricate prediagnostic phase, and uncertainty about late effects. Heightened vulnerability to distress signals exceptional needs for support and information among parents of children treated for central nervous system or bone tumors.","['Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']","['10.1097/MPH.0b013e31818a9553 [doi]', '00043426-200811000-00005 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their physiologic effects are mediated by binding to specific cell surface receptors (G-CSFr and GM-CSFr, respectively), which are widely expressed from immature bone marrow cells to mature peripheral granulocytes. The fact that concentrations of plasma G-CSF and GM-CSF and their receptors are changed in infectious diseases showing neutrophilia is known, but such changes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) have not been studied. Based on quantitative assays of plasma G-CSF and GM-CSF and their receptors on the peripheral granulocytes of CML patients and healthy controls, this study analyzes the differences between these groups in G-CSF and GM-CSF levels, as well as quantitative and qualitative changes in the receptors. Plasma levels of G-CSF and GM-CSF were measured in 47 patients in the chronic phase of CML and 25 healthy adults as normal controls. G-CSFr and GM-CSFr on peripheral granulocytes were analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry, and changes in G-CSF and GM-CSF receptor counts were also measured. Plasma concentrations of G-CSF and GM-CSF in CML patients were similar to normal controls (p>0.05). The quantity of G-CSFr on neutrophils was more highly expressed than on other cell types in both groups, and the amount of this receptor in patients with CML was less than in normal controls (p=0.001). GM-CSFr was expressed in higher concentrations on monocytes than neutrophils, and there was no difference in the amount of GM-CSFr on neutrophils. After incubation with excess G-CSF, the expressed amounts of G-CSFr on neutrophils and monocytes were decreased in both groups. However, G-CSFr on the monocytes was decreased in healthy controls (p=0.02) with no difference in patients with CML. The quantities of GM-CSFr expression on neutrophils and monocytes after incubation with excess GM-CSF were decreased in both groups. Granulocyte counts in peripheral blood of CML patients were not correlated with the plasma concentrations of G-CSF or GM-CSF, nor with the expression of G-CSFr or GM-CSFr on granulocytes. Granulopoiesis in patients with CML was not mediated by increased plasma CSF concentrations, and there was no difference in the amounts of G-CSFr or GM-CSFr expressed on the granulocytes. This suggests that a structural change may occur on monocytes of CML patients, since the binding capacity of G-CSFr to G-CSF on the monocytes is different from the normal controls.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, 62 Yeouido-dong Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seoul, 150-713, South Korea.']",['38/4/331 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phorbol esters are used at very low concentrations as differentiating agents in the therapy of myeloid leukemias. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), in turn, is a death ligand that spares normal cells and is therefore currently under clinical trials for cancer therapy. Emerging evidence, however, suggests that TRAIL is also involved in nonapoptotic functions, like cell differentiation. PKCepsilon is differentially modulated along normal hematopoiesis, and its levels modulate the response of hematopoietic precursors to TRAIL. Here, we investigated the effects of the combination of phorbol esters (phorbol ester 4-beta-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate [PDBu]) and TRAIL in the survival/differentiation of AML cells. We demonstrate here that PDBu sensitizes primary AML cells to both the apoptogenic and the differentiative effects of TRAIL via PKCepsilon down-modulation, without affecting TRAIL receptor surface expression. We believe that the use of TRAIL in combination with phorbol esters (or possibly more specific PKCepsilon down-modulators) might represent a significative improvement of our therapeutic arsenal against AML.","['Department of Anatomy, Pharmacology and Forensic Medicine, Human Anatomy Section, University of Parma, Ospedale Maggiore, Parma, Italy.']","['S0006-4971(20)39428-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-143784 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether PRAME is naturally immunogenic, we studied CD8(+) T-cell responses to 4 HLA-A*0201-restricted PRAME-derived epitopes (PRA100, PRA142, PRA300, PRA425) in HLA-A*0201-positive patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and healthy donors. CD8(+) T cells recognizing PRAME peptides could be detected ex vivo in 4 of 10 ALL, 6 of 10 AML, 3 of 10 CML patients, and 3 of 10 donors by HLA-A2 tetramer analysis and flow cytometry for intracellular interferon-gamma. The frequency of PRAME-specific CD8(+) T cells was greater in patients with AML, CML, and ALL than healthy controls. All peptides were immunogenic in patients, while responses were only detected to PRA300 in donors. High PRAME expression in patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells was associated with responses to greater than or equal to 2 PRAME epitopes compared with low PRAME expression levels (4/7 vs 0/23, P = .001), suggesting a PRAME-driven T-cell response. PRAME-specific T cells were readily expanded in short-term cultures in donors and patients. These results provide evidence for spontaneous T cell reactivity against multiple epitopes of PRAME in ALL, AML, and CML. The potential for developing PRAME as a target for immunotherapy in leukemia deserves further exploration.","['Department of Hematology, Imperial College, Hammersmith Campus, London, United Kingdom. k.rezvani@imperial.ac.uk']","['S0006-4971(20)37607-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-144071 [doi]']",20081106,,PMC2652370,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated outcome of patients with ALL in first complete remission (CR1), according to a sibling donor versus no-donor comparison. Eligible patients (433) were entered in 2 consecutive, prospective studies, of whom 288 (67%) were younger than 55 years, in CR1, and eligible to receive consolidation by either an autologous SCT or an allo-SCT. Allo-SCT was performed in 91 of 96 patients with a compatible sibling donor. Cumulative incidences of relapse at 5 years were, respectively, 24 and 55% for patients with a donor versus those without a donor (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; 0.23-0.60; P < .001). Nonrelapse mortality estimated 16% (+/- 4) at 5 years after allo-SCT. As a result, disease-free survival (DFS) at 5 years was significantly better in the donor group: 60 versus 42% in the no-donor group (HR: 0.60; 0.41-0.89; P = .01). After risk-group analysis, improved outcome was more pronounced in standard-risk patients with a donor, who experienced an overall survival of 69% at 5 years (P = .05). In conclusion, standard-risk ALL patients with a sibling donor may show favorable survival following SCT, due to both a strong reduction of relapse and a modest nonrelapse mortality.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) can provide global and functional imaging of tumor angiogenesis. In this study, we performed bone marrow DCE-MRI prospectively at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy in 78 de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and correlated it with treatment outcome. An algorithm to assess bone marrow angiogenesis by measuring the DCE-MRI time-intensity curve pixel by pixel was developed using 3 distinct parameters: peak enhancement ratio (Peak) to indicate tissue blood perfusion; amplitude (Amp) to reflect vascularity; and volume transfer constant (K trans) to indicate vascular permeability. The Peak and Amp decreased significantly at remission status after induction chemotherapy. Patients with higher Peak or Amp at diagnosis had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival than others. Cox multivariate analysis identified higher Peak value (hazard ratio, 9.181; 95% confidence interval, 1.740-48.437; P = .009) as an independent predictor for overall survival in addition to unfavorable karyotype and old age. Our findings provide evidence that increased bone marrow angiogenesis measured by DCE-MRI can predict adverse clinical outcome in AML patients.

The intoxication pathway of PE immunotoxins involves receptor-mediated internalization and trafficking through endosomes/lysosomes, during which the immunotoxin undergoes important proteolytic processing steps but must otherwise remain intact for eventual transport to the cytosol. We have investigated the proteolytic susceptibility of PE38 immunotoxins to lysosomal proteases and found that cleavage clusters within a limited segment of PE38. We subsequently generated mutants containing deletions in this region using HA22, an anti-CD22 Fv-PE38 immunotoxin currently undergoing clinical trials for B-cell malignancies. One mutant, HA22-LR, lacks all identified cleavage sites, is resistant to lysosomal degradation, and retains excellent biologic activity. HA22-LR killed chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells more potently and uniformly than HA22, suggesting that lysosomal protease digestion may limit immunotoxin efficacy unless the susceptible domain is eliminated. Remarkably, mice tolerated doses of HA22-LR at least 10-fold higher than lethal doses of HA22, and these higher doses exhibited markedly enhanced antitumor activity. We conclude that HA22-LR advances the therapeutic efficacy of HA22 by using an approach that may be applicable to other PE-based immunotoxins.","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892-4264, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)39319-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-08-173195 [doi]']",20081106,"['N01-CO-12 400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2670794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we demonstrate how WA exhibits a strong growth-inhibitory effect on several human leukemic cell lines and on primary cells from patients with lymphoblastic and myeloid leukemia in a dose-dependent manner, showing no toxicity on normal human lymphocytes and primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells. WA-mediated decrease in cell viability was observed through apoptosis as demonstrated by externalization of phosphatidylserine, a time-dependent increase in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio; loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspases 9 and 3 activation; and accumulation of cells in sub-G0 region based on DNA fragmentation. A search for the downstream pathway further reveals that WA-induced apoptosis was mediated by an increase in phosphorylated p38MAPK expression, which further activated downstream signaling by phosphorylating ATF-2 and HSP27 in leukemic cells. The RNA interference of p38MAPK protected these cells from WA-induced apoptosis. The RNAi knockdown of p38MAPK inhibited active phosphorylation of p38MAPK, Bax expression, activation of caspase 3 and increase in Annexin V positivity. Altogether, these findings suggest that p38MAPK in leukemic cells promotes WA-induced apoptosis. WA caused increased levels of Bax in response to MAPK signaling, which resulted in the initiation of mitochondrial death cascade, and therefore it holds promise as a new, alternative, inexpensive chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of patients with leukemia of both lymphoid and myeloid origin.","['Department of Infectious diseases and Immunology, Indian Institute of Chemical Biology, 4 Raja S.C.

The BH3 mimetic ABT-737 is a potent small molecule inhibitor of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2/Bcl-X(L)/Bcl-w. In this report, we examined whether ABT-737 is effective in killing melanoma cells in combination with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132, and further evaluated the mechanisms of action. Viability, morphological, and Annexin V apoptosis assays showed that ABT-737 alone exhibited little cytotoxicity, yet it displayed strong synergistic lethality when combined with MG-132. In addition, the detection of Bax/Bak activation indicated that the combination treatment synergistically induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis revealed that this combination treatment induced expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa- and caspase-dependent degradation of the anti-apoptotic protein, Mcl-1. Finally, siRNA-mediated inhibition of Mcl-1 expression significantly increased sensitivity to ABT-737 in these cells, and knocking down Noxa expression protected the cells from cytotoxicity induced by the combination treatment. These findings demonstrate that ABT-737 combined with MG-132 synergistically induced Noxa-dependent mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. In summary, this study indicates promising therapeutic potential of targeting anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members in treating melanoma, and it validates rational molecular approaches that target anti-apoptotic defenses when developing cancer treatments.","['Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of Colorado Denver, Aurora, Colorado 80010, USA.']","['S0022-202X(15)34283-4 [pii]', '10.1038/jid.2008.327 [doi]']",20081106,"['P30 CA 046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AR26427-18/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

C/EBPalpha induces bcl-2 in cooperation with nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) p50 to inhibit apoptosis. We now demonstrate that C/EBPalpha or a C/EBPalphaLZ oncoprotein binds the bcl-2 P2 promoter in chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and induces the promoter dependent on the integrity of a kappaB site. C/EBPalpha expressed as a transgene in B cells binds and activates the bcl-2 promoter, but not in nfkb1-/- mice lacking NF-kappaB p50. Bcl-2 is central to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, whereas FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIP) modulates caspase-8, the initiator caspase of the extrinsic pathway. C/EBPalpha and C/EBPalphaLZ also bind the FLIP promoter and induce its expression dependent upon NF-kappaB p50. Moreover, induction of FLIP by C/EBPalpha protects splenocytes from Fas ligand-induced apoptosis, but only if p50 is present. We also demonstrate the direct interaction between bacterially produced C/EBPalpha and NF-kappaB p50, mediated by the C/EBPalpha basic region. These findings indicate that C/EBPalpha or its oncoproteins activate the bcl-2 and FLIP genes by tethering to their promoters through bound NF-kappaB p50.

Here, we report on the effects of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT) and DLI in a novel model of irradiation-induced murine myelodysplastic/myeloproliferation syndrome (MD/MPS). Total body irradiation with 8.5 Gy in SJL/J mice gave rise to a lethal wasting syndrome in 60% of mice, characterized by 1 degrees normocellular bone marrow with dysplastic features in erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic cell lineages, 2 degrees lymphosplenomegaly with spleens harboring a prominent extramedullary hematopoiesis with erythroid, myeloid and megakaryocytic lineages exhibiting dysplastic features, and foci of dysplastic hematomyelopoiesis in the liver, 3 degrees peripheral thrombocytopenia and 4 degrees evidence of disseminated infection or leukemic transformation in selected animals. This clinicopathological picture was consistent with a murine form of MD/MPS. Syngeneic or allogeneic (BALB/c) T cell-depleted BMT could not prevent the occurrence of lethal MD/MPS. In contrast, DLI at weeks 2-4 after BMT led to restoration of the dysbalanced hematomyelopoiesis. However, severe DLI-induced acute graft-versus-host disease occurred, precluding a survival advantage.

More sensitive, multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) can detect far lower blast counts, allowing for a precise and reliable calculation of blast cell decrease rate (BDR). Such a multiparametric FCM four-colours/single-tube protocol, combining CD11b, CD45-ECD and CD16-PC5, was applied to peripheral blood samples from 130 AML patients, collected daily during induction chemotherapy. Normalized blast cell percentages were used to calculate the relevant decrease slopes. Slope thresholds (<-25, -25 to -15 and >-15), or the time required to reach 90% depletion of the peripheral blast load (<5, 5 or >5 days), was strongly associated with the achievement of complete remission (P<0.0001). Log-rank test and Cox model showed that they also carried high statistical significance (P<0.0001) for disease-free survival. The prognostic value of cytogenetic features, confirmed in this series, was refined by BDR, which allowed to discriminate between good- and poor-risk patients among those with intermediate or normal karyotypes.

Stromal cells within the bone marrow microenvironment constitutively secrete stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), the ligand for CXCR4. Activation of CXCR4 induces leukemia cell trafficking and homing to the marrow microenvironment, where CXCL12 retains leukemia cells in close contact with marrow stromal cells that provide growth and drug resistance signals. CXCR4 antagonists, such as Plerixafor (AMD3100) and T140 analogs, can disrupt adhesive tumor-stroma interactions and mobilize leukemia cells from their protective stromal microenvironment, making them more accessible to conventional drugs. Therefore, targeting the CXCR4-CXCL12 axis is a novel, attractive therapeutic approach that is explored in ongoing clinical trials in leukemia patients. Initially, CXCR4 antagonists were developed for the treatment of HIV, where CXCR4 functions as a co-receptor for virus entry into T cells. Subsequently, CXCR4 antagonists were noticed to induce leukocytosis, and are currently used clinically for mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells.

In this study, we showed that VEGF protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the leukemic blasts than in the normal hematopoietic counterparts. A statistically significant correlation between expression of VEGF and p27(Kip1) was observed in bone marrows from 42 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (P<0.001). We further demonstrated that forced VEGF overexpression or autocrine VEGF stimulation of VEGFR-2 triggers proliferation and migration/invasion of U-937 leukemic cells, thereby inducing a more invasive tumor phenotype. U-937 cells overexpressing VEGF were resistant to all-trans-retinoic acid-(ATRA) or camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Finally, we showed that increased p27(Kip1) expression enhanced the ability of VEGF and VEGFR-2 to promote the migration of U-937 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that elevated level of VEGF may contribute to the adverse patient outcome by promoting cell growth, survival and migration of leukemic cells and by reducing the sensitivity of leukemic cells to therapeutic agents-induced apoptosis.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Center for Molecular Pathology, Clinical Research Center, Lund University, University Hospital, Malmo, Sweden.']","['leu2008300 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.300 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to myeloid and B-cell neoplasms, translocations in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) are poorly understood. Here, we identified recurrent translocations involving the multiple myeloma oncogene-1/interferon regulatory factor-4 (IRF4) locus in PTCLs. IRF4 translocations exist in myeloma and some B-cell lymphomas, but have not been reported earlier in PTCLs. We studied 169 PTCLs using fluorescence in situ hybridization and identified 12 cases with IRF4 translocations. Two cases with t(6;14)(p25;q11.2) had translocations between IRF4 and the T-cell receptor-alpha (TCRA) locus. Both were cytotoxic PTCLs, unspecified (PTCL-Us) involving bone marrow and skin. In total, 8 of the remaining 10 cases were cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphomas (ALCLs) without TCRA rearrangements (57% of cutaneous ALCLs tested). These findings identified IRF4 translocations as a novel recurrent genetic abnormality in PTCLs. Cytotoxic PTCL-Us involving bone marrow and skin and containing IRF4/TCRA translocations might represent a distinct clinicopathologic entity. Translocations involving IRF4 but not TCRA appear to occur predominantly in cutaneous ALCLs. Detecting these translocations may be useful in lymphoma diagnosis. Further, due to its involvement in translocations, MUM1/IRF4 protein may play an important biologic role in some PTCLs, and might represent a possible therapeutic target.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA. feldman.andrew@mayo.edu']","['leu2008320 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.320 [doi]']",20081106,"['P50 CA097274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA097274-07/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA97274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2656414,['NIHMS70248'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel, nonchemotherapeutic treatment regimens are becoming increasingly important in these patients, as well as in patients in whom combination chemotherapy-based treatment has failed or resulted in relapse. Nonchemotherapeutic agents include monoclonal antibodies, glucocorticoids, immunomodulatory drugs, drugs with specific intracellular molecular targets, vaccines and cellular immunotherapies. These agents use diverse mechanisms of action that may complement each other, therefore providing a scientific rationale to investigate combinations of these agents in the treatment of CLL. In this review, we will discuss current knowledge of available nonchemotherapeutic agents, available clinical experience with their use alone and in combination and how these approaches may affect outcomes in patients with CLL.","['Department of Leukemia, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, The University of Texas, Houston, TX 77030, USA. sfaderl@mdanderson.org']","['leu2008322 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.322 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,70,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We characterized FIP1L1-PDGFRA junction sequences from 113 patients at the mRNA (n=113) and genomic DNA (n=85) levels. Transcript types could be assigned in 109 patients as type A (n=50, 46%) or B (n=47, 43%), which were created by cryptic acceptor splice sites in different introns of FIP1L1 (type A) or within PDGFRA exon 12 (type B). We also characterized a new transcript type C (n=12, 11%) in which both genomic breakpoints fell within coding sequences creating a hybrid exon without use of a cryptic acceptor splice site. The location of genomic breakpoints within PDGFRA and the availability of AG splice sites determine the transcript type and restrict the FIP1L1 exons used for the creation of the fusion. Stretches of overlapping sequences were identified at the genomic junction site, suggesting that the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion is created by illegitimate non-homologous end-joining. Statistical analyses provided evidence for clustering of breakpoints within FIP1L1 that may be related to DNA- or chromatin-related structural features. The variability in the anatomy of the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion has important implications for strategies to detect the fusion at diagnosis or for monitoring response to treatment.","['III Medizinische Universitatsklinik, Medizinische Fakultat Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']","['leu2008310 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.310 [doi]']",20081106,['CA89032/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,['European LeukemiaNet'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We screened 202 cases and detected genomic junctions in all samples previously identified as RT-PCR positive (n=43). Genomic fusions were amplified by single step PCR in all cases whereas only 22 (51%) were single step RT-PCR positive. Importantly, FIP1L1-PDGFRA was detected in two cases that initially tested negative by RT-PCR or fluorescence in situ hybridization. Absolute quantitation of the fusion by real-time PCR from genomic DNA (gDNA) using patient-specific primer/probe combinations at presentation (n=13) revealed a 40-fold variation between patients (range, 0.027-1.1 FIP1L1-PDGFRA copies/haploid genome). In follow up samples, quantitative analysis of gDNA gave 1-2 log greater sensitivity than RQ-PCR of cDNA. Minimal residual disease assessment using gDNA showed that 11 of 13 patients achieved complete molecular response to imatinib within a median of 9 months (range, 3-17) of starting treatment, with a sensitivity of detection of up to 1 in 10(5). One case relapsed with an acquired D842V mutation. We conclude that detection of FIP1L1-PDGFRA from gDNA is a useful adjunct to standard diagnostic procedures and enables more sensitive follow up of positive cases after treatment.","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, University of Southampton, Salisbury, UK.']","['leu2008309 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.309 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported in our previous studies that short-term treatment by carvedilol ex vivo inhibits ROS generation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of carvedilol on phagocytes. METHODS: Human leukemia HL-60 cells differentiated into granulocyte-like cells were used as the model. Final concentrations of carvedilol were 0.1-100 micromol/l. The production of ROS by HL-60 cells was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence (CL). RESULTS: Carvedilol in concentrations 0.1-10 micromol/l did not exhibit any toxic effect on cells (measured using bioluminescent bacteria Photorhabdus luminescens subsp. thracensis). One hour's treatment with 10 micromol/l carvedilol significantly decreased both spontaneous and activated CL of cells. Conversely, no inhibitory effects on CL were observed in 10 micromol/l carvedilol after 48 h incubation; lower concentrations of carvedilol even slightly increased the CL activity of HL-60 cells. A significant increase in spontaneous CL activity was detected in cells incubated with 10 micromol/l carvedilol in comparison with the control. Powerful antioxidative properties of carvedilol against peroxyl radical (ORAC assay) were proved. No scavenging of nitric oxide (electrochemical method) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term influence of carvedilol can induce an increase in the generation of phagocyte-derived ROS and potentially also other inflammatory mediators. The increased ROS production is compensated for by antioxidative properties of carvedilol although the increased production of inflammatory mediators could affect the proper function of immune system.","['Institute of Biophysics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Brno, Czech Republic. alojek@ibp.cz']",['NEL290508A18 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The potential antioxidant activity of CME was proved by the 1,1-diphenyl- 2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. The cytotoxicity of CME was measured by the cell growth inhibition assay using murine leukemia L1210 cell line and human promyelocytic HL-60 leukemia cells. Apoptosis-inducing effect was determined by fluorescence microscopy (chromatin condensation and nuclear DNA fragmentation). RESULTS: In the DPPH assay CME acted as a scavenger of DPPH free radical. The results on antiproliferative properties assessment clearly demonstrated that CME had a cytotoxic effect towards both leukemia cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the human promyelocytic HL-60 cells were more sensitive to CME treatment than the L1210 cells. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the extract of C. majus L. had a strong antioxidant potential and exerted the antiproliferative activity via apoptosis on leukemia cells. CME due to the presence of the isoquinoline alkaloids and the flavonoid components may play an important role in both cancer chemoprevention through its antioxidant activity and modern cancer chemotherapy as cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing agent.","['Department of Genetics, Faculty of Natural Sciences, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",['NEL290508A25 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, dasatinib induced apoptosis in mast cell and leukemia cell lines expressing KIT(D816V). Here, we present the first case report of long-term hematologic and molecular remission achieved with combined treatment with chemotherapy and dasatinib in a patient with systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with mutant KIT(D816V) expression. A 50-year-old male presented with pancytopenia, organomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and lytic bone lesions in the pelvis. The patient was found to have systemic mastocytosis (SM) and acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML) positive for KIT(D816V) and therefore diagnosed with SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). Both primary CD34+ cells containing myeloblasts and CD34- cells containing mastocytes obtained from the diagnostic BM lost viability markedly by in vitro dasatinib treatment. In addition, dasatinib diminished activity of STAT5, STAT3, AKT and ERK and attenuated the levels of c-KIT. The patient achieved a hematologic complete remission (HCR) by two induction chemotherapies with residual mastocytes. Dasatinib (70mg PO bid, days 1-4) was added to consolidation treatments composed of four cycles of high dose cytarabine and was then continued as maintenance therapy (50mg PO bid). Periodic bone marrow (BM) aspirate/biopsies (eight over 18 months) were performed. The patient remained in HCR, and the mastocyte burden decreased by 50%. The bone lytic lesions improved. The KIT(D816V)mutation progressively decreased and became undetectable in the last three BM analyses. This result was confirmed by an independent laboratory showing a lack of c-KIT mutation in both CD34+ cells and CD34- cells in the last BM. No significant adverse effects of dasatinib occurred. Dasatinib has in vitro and in vivo efficacy in SM-AML patients with KIT(D816V) mutation. Along with chemotherapy, dasatinib should be considered in these patients particularly if they cannot undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation for this poor prognostic AML.","['Medical College of Georgia, Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology/Oncology, Augusta, GA 30912-3125, USA. custun@mcg.edu']","['S0145-2126(08)00452-9 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.09.027 [doi]']",20081104,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three hundred and sixty-seven follow-up bone marrow samples, collected at predefined time points during a uniform treatment protocol, were analysed for BCR-ABL1 transcripts by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Ninety-seven patients (97%) achieved complete remission (CR), and the relapse-free survival (RFS) rate was 46% at 3 years. Negative MRD at the end of induction therapy was not associated with longer RFS or a lower relapse rate (P = 0.800 and P = 0.964 respectively). Twenty-nine patients showed MRD elevation during haematological CR. Of these, 10 of the 16 who had undergone allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in first CR were alive without relapse at a median of 2.9 years after transplantation, whereas 12 of the 13 who had not undergone allogeneic HSCT experienced a relapse.

Treatment strategies for pediatric ALCL vary from short pulse B-NHL chemotherapy to prolonged leukemia like therapy. The optimal treatment strategy is unknown. METHODS: CCG-5941 used a compressed aggressive multiagent T-cell lineage chemotherapy regimen consisting of a 3-week induction therapy (vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, daunomycin, asparaginase) followed by a 3-week consolidation period (vincristine, prednisone, etoposide, 6-thioguanine, cytarabine, asparaginase, methotrexate) followed by six courses of maintenance chemotherapy at 7-week intervals (cyclophosphamide, 6-thioguanine, vincristine, prednisone, doxorubicin, asparaginase, methotrexate etoposide, cytarabine). Total therapy was 48 weeks. RESULTS: Eighty-six children (male 56%, female 44%) with non-localized ALCL (CD30+) were treated. The majority of tumors were positive for ALK (90%) and of T lineage (83%). Extranodal disease was common (mediastinum 35%, skin 15%, lung 14%, bone 12%, bone marrow 13%, liver 6%, and other viscera 17%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 82% of patients. The 5-year EFS was 68% (95% CI of 57-78%) and the 5-year OS was 80% (95% CI of 69-87%). There were 21 relapses and 4 toxic deaths as first events. Relapse occurred early with 17 (81%) relapses occurring within 2 years of diagnosis and 12 (57%) while receiving therapy. Univariate analysis for risk factors only identified bone marrow involvement predicting lower EFS (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: CCG-5941 demonstrated efficacy similar to previously reported regimens but with significant hematologic toxicity.","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters, Norfolk, Virginia 23507, USA.""]",['10.1002/pbc.21817 [doi]'],,"['U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2769495,['NIHMS123401'],,,,"[""Children's Cancer Group Study 5941""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular basis of human adrenal development, and many forms of disease, is still poorly understood. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the role of two new candidate genes, CBP/p300-interacting transactivator, with Glu/Asp-rich C-terminal domain, 2 (CITED2), and pre-B-cell leukemia transcription factor 1 (PBX1), in human adrenal development and disease. DESIGN: CITED2 and PBX1 expression in early human fetal adrenal development was assessed using RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. The regulation of CITED2 and PBX1 by steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) and dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia congenital, critical region on the X chromosome, gene-1 (DAX1) was evaluated in NCI-H295R human adrenocortical tumor cells by studying promoter regulation. Finally, mutational analysis of CITED2 and PBX1 was performed in patients with primary adrenal disorders. RESULTS: CITED2 and PBX1 are expressed in the human fetal adrenal gland during early development. Both genes are activated by SF-1 in a dose-dependent manner in NCI-H295R cells, and, surprisingly, PBX1 is synergistically activated by SF-1 and DAX1. Mutational analysis failed to reveal significant coding sequence changes in individuals with primary adrenal disorders. CONCLUSIONS: CITED2 and PBX1 are likely to be important mediators of adrenal development and function in humans, but mutations in these genes are not common causes of adrenal failure in patients in whom a molecular diagnosis remains unknown. The positive interaction between DAX1 and SF-1 in regulating PBX1 may be an important mechanism in this process.","['Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, University College London Institute of Child Health, University College London, 30 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1EH, United Kingdom.']","['jc.2008-1064 [pii]', '10.1210/jc.2008-1064 [doi]']",20081104,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', '079666/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G0700089/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC2814552,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important role for Lyn has been reported in acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, as well as certain solid tumors. Although several Src-family inhibitors are available, the development of Lyn-specific inhibitors, or inhibitors with reduced off-target activity to Lyn, has been hampered by the lack of structural data on the Lyn kinase. Here we report the crystal structure of the non-liganded form of Lyn kinase domain, as well as in complex with three different inhibitors: the ATP analogue AMP-PNP; the pan Src kinase inhibitor PP2; and the BCR-Abl/Src-family inhibitor Dasatinib. The Lyn kinase domain was determined in its ""active"" conformation, but in the unphosphorylated state. All three inhibitors are bound at the ATP-binding site, with PP2 and Dasatinib extending into a hydrophobic pocket deep in the substrate cleft, thereby providing a basis for the Src-specific inhibition. Analysis of sequence and structural differences around the active site region of the Src-family PTKs were evident. Accordingly, our data provide valuable information for the further development of therapeutics targeting Lyn and the important Src-family of kinases.","['Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.', 'Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.', 'Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.', 'Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia; Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.', 'Protein Crystallography Unit, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia, and the Laboratory for Cancer Medicine and Cell Signalling Group, Western Australian Institute for Medical Research and Centre for Medical Research, The University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia 6000, Australia.

Two of the seven member human APOBEC3 enzymes strongly restrict human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in vitro and in vivo. We show here that ssDNA hyperediting of an infectious exogenous gammaretrovirus, the Friend-murine leukemia virus, by murine APOBEC1 and APOBEC3 deaminases occurs in vitro. Murine APOBEC1 was able to hyperdeaminate cytidine residues in murine leukemia virus genomic RNA as well. Analysis of the edited sites shows that the deamination in vivo was due to mouse APOBEC1 rather than APOBEC3. Furthermore, murine APOBEC1 is able to hyperedit its primary substrate in vivo, the apolipoprotein B mRNA, and a variety of heterologous RNAs. In short, murine APOBEC1 is a hypermutator of both RNA and ssDNA in vivo, which could exert occasional side effects upon overexpression.","['Unite de Retrovirologie Moleculaire, CNRS URA, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']","['S0022-2836(08)01300-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.jmb.2008.10.043 [doi]']",20081101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For virologists, the Friend virus-induced disease has provided deep insights into the host mechanisms influencing susceptibility to retroviral infection and viremia. These insights have contributed to the understanding of HIV and other human retroviral infections. For cell biologists and oncologists, this leukemia has been a powerful experimental model to identify critical oncogenes involved in a multi-stage process, to understand the contribution of host genes to cancer development, and to investigate the mechanisms leading to cell growth autonomy. This model also provided an example of oncogenic reversion since Friend tumor cells can reinitiate their erythroid differentiation program when exposed in vitro to some chemical inducers. This review highlights recent findings demonstrating that the leukemic progression depends on the cooperation of at least two oncogenic events, one interfering with differentiation and one conferring a proliferative advantage. The Friend model of leukemia progression recapitulates the two phases of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Coupling of insights from studies on the Friend erythroleukemia with knowledge on AML might allow a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the evolution of leukemia in mice and men.","[""Inserm U830, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris cedex 05, France. framoreau@curie.fr""]","['1742-4690-5-99 [pii]', '10.1186/1742-4690-5-99 [doi]']",20081104,,PMC2585586,,,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Meningiomas at the cranial base pose technical challenges and result in increased morbidity. To investigate the molecular mechanisms of meningioma formation, the expression profiles of 12 000 genes from meningiomas and dural specimens were compared. METHODS: Ribonucleic acid from 6 meningiomas (World Health Organization Grade I) and 4 dural specimens was profiled using U95A GeneChips (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Expression profiles of the 2 groups were compared using dChip and Data Mining Tool software packages (Affymetrix, Inc.) to identify differentially expressed genes. Down-regulation of a differentially expressed tumor suppressor gene, deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC1), was verified by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Function and methylation of DLC1 were assessed by ectopic expression in 5 primary cultures, demethylation assay using 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction in 4 meningioma samples. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling revealed up-regulation of 5 genes (fibroblast growth factor 9, gibbon leukemia virus receptor 2, cyclin D1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A, and 28S ribosomal ribonucleic acid) and down-regulation of 35 genes, including DLC1, in meningiomas. The down-regulation of DLC1 in meningiomas was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. Transfection of DLC1 complementary deoxyribonucleic acid into primary cultures of 5 meningiomas resulted in decreased replication. Although demethylation decreased meningioma cell growth rates in vitro, methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction did not detect DLC1 promoter methylation.

Further bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethylacetate fraction using column chromatography led to the isolation of pectolinarigenin (5,7-dihydroxy-4',6-dimethoxyflavone), along with pectolinarin [pectolinarigenin 7-rhamnosyl-(1-->6)-glucoside]. Pectolinarigenin strongly inhibited COX-2-mediated PGE2 and 5-LOX-mediated LT production at >1 microM, indicating that it is a dual inhibitor of COX-2/5-LOX. However, pectolinarigenin did not affect COX-2 expression or nuclear transcription factor (NF-kappaB) activation. In addition, in vivo studies demonstrated that oral administration of these two compounds at 20-100 mg/kg resulted in similar inhibitory activities against several animal models of inflammation/allergy: arachidonic acid-induced mouse ear edema, carrageenan-induced mouse paw edema and passive cutaneous anaphylaxis. All of these results suggest that pectolinarigenin and pectolinarin possess anti-inflammatory activity and that they may inhibit eicosanoid formation in inflammatory lesions.

In the current paper, we have studied the possible differences among L1210 and L1210/VCR cells in expression of endoplasmic reticulum proteins involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis and calcium-dependent processes. Amounts of mRNA encoding both calcium release channels (ryanodine receptor channels--RyR and IP3-receptor channels--IP3R) were found to be at similar levels in sensitive and resistant cells. However, mRNAs encoding IP3R1 or 2 were decreased in resistant cells cultivated in the presence of VCR (1.08 micromol/l), while mRNA encoding RyR remained unchanged. The amount of mRNA for SERCA2 was decreased in resistant cells when compared with sensitive cells. This decrease was more pronounced when resistant cells were cultivated in the presence of vincristine (VCR). Calnexin was found to be less expressed at the protein level in resistant as in sensitive cells. The level of mRNA encoding calnexin was decreased only when resistant cells were cultivated in the presence of VCR. Calnexin was found to be associated with immature P-gp in resistant cells. Thus, differences exist between sensitive and resistant cells in the expression of endoplasmic reticulum proteins involved in the control of intracellular calcium homeostasis or calcium-dependent processes. These changes may be at least partially responsible for the lack of sensitivity of resistant cells to thapsigargin.","['Institute of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 5, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No large registry studies of acute GVHD risk factors have been reported in two decades. Risk factors may have changed in this interval as transplant-related techniques have evolved. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Acute GVHD risk factors were analyzed in 1,960 adults after HLA-identical sibling myeloablative transplant for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) reported by 226 centers worldwide to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research from 1995 to 2002. Outcome was measured as time from transplant to onset of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD, with death without acute GVHD as a competing risk. RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD was 35% (95% CI, 33% to 37%). In multivariable analyses, factors significantly associated with grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD were cyclophosphamide + total-body irradiation versus busulfan + cyclophosphamide (relative risk [RR] = 1.4; P < .0001), blood cell versus bone marrow grafts in patients age 18 to 39 years (RR = 1.43; P = .0023), recipient age 40 and older versus age 18 to 39 years receiving bone marrow grafts (RR = 1.44; P = .0005), CML versus AML/ALL (RR = 1.35; P = .0003), white/Black versus Asian/Hispanic race (RR = 1.54; P = .0003), Karnofsky performance score less than 90 versus 90 to 100 (RR = 1.27; P = .014), and recipient/donor cytomegalovirus-seronegative versus either positive (RR = 1.20; P = .04). Stratification by disease showed the same significant predictors of grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD for CML; however, KPS and cytomegalovirus serostatus were not significant predictors for AML/ALL. CONCLUSION: This analysis confirmed several previously reported risk factors for grade 2 to 4 acute GVHD. However, several new factors were identified whereas others are no longer significant. These new data may facilitate individualized risk estimates and raise several interesting biologic questions.","['Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

To investigate whether aliskiren accumulation in secretory granules contributes to these phenomena, renin-synthesizing mast cells were incubated with aliskiren, washed, and exposed to forskolin in medium without aliskiren (0.1 to 1000 nmol/L). (Pro)renin concentrations were measured by renin- and prorenin-specific immunoradiometric assays, and renin activity was measured by enzyme-kinetic assay. Without aliskiren, the culture medium predominantly contained prorenin, the cells exclusively stored renin, and forskolin doubled renin release. Aliskiren dose-dependently bound to (pro)renin in the medium and cell lysates and did not alter the effect of forskolin. The aliskiren concentrations required to bind prorenin were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those needed to bind renin. Blockade of cell lysate renin activity ranged from 27+/-15% to 79+/-5%, and these percentages were identical for the renin that was released by forskolin, indicating that they represented the same renin pool, ie, the renin storage granules. Comparison of renin and prorenin measurements in blood samples obtained from human volunteers treated with aliskiren, both before and after prorenin activation, revealed that <or=30% of prorenin was detected in renin-specific assays. In conclusion, aliskiren accumulates in renin granules, thus allowing long-lasting renin-angiotensin system blockade beyond the half-life of this drug. Aliskiren also binds to prorenin. This allows its detection as renin, and might explain, in part, the renin rise during renin inhibition.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Pharmacology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']","['HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.123042 [pii]', '10.1161/HYPERTENSIONAHA.108.123042 [doi]']",20081103,,,,['Hypertension. 2009 Feb;53(2):e17; author reply e18.

The first tumorigenic cells are detected among more immature CD4(-)8(+)TCR-alphabeta(-) cells that give rise to monoclonal tumors with a single, unique TCR-beta chain and diverse TCR-alpha chains, pinpointing malignant transformation to a stage after pre-TCR signaling and before completion of TCR-alpha rearrangement. In T-ALL, E2A deficiency is accompanied by further transcriptional up-regulation of c-Myc and concomitant dysregulation of the c-Myc-p53 axis at the transcriptional level.

However, germ line Ott1 deletion results in fetal demise prior to embryonic day 10.5, indicating additional developmental requirements for Ott1. The spen gene family, to which Ott1 belongs, has a transcriptional activation/repression domain and RNA recognition motifs and has a significant role in the development of the head and thorax in Drosophila melanogaster. Early Ott1-deficient embryos show growth retardation and incomplete closure of the notochord. Further analysis demonstrated placental defects in the spongiotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast layers, resulting in an arrest of vascular branching morphogenesis. The rescue of the placental defect using a conditional allele with a trophoblast-sparing cre transgene allowed embryos to form a normal placenta and survive gestation. This outcome showed that the process of vascular branching morphogenesis in Ott1-deficient animals was regulated by the trophoblast compartment rather than the fetal vasculature. Mice surviving to term manifested hyposplenia and abnormal cardiac development. Analysis of global gene expression of Ott1-deficient embryonic hearts showed an enrichment of hypoxia-related genes and a significant alteration of several candidate genes critical for cardiac development. Thus, Ott1-dependent pathways, in addition to being implicated in leukemogenesis, may also be important for the pathogenesis of placental insufficiency and cardiac malformations.","[""Division of Hematology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. glen.raffel@umassmed.edu""]","['MCB.00370-08 [pii]', '10.1128/MCB.00370-08 [doi]']",20081103,"['K08 CA111399/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA66996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",PMC2612519,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we have demonstrated that in vivo ligation of GITR (glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor-related gene) can activate donor CD8(+) T cells, subsequently converting the disease pattern from cGVHD to an acute form. In this study, we investigated the effect of an agonistic mAb against CD40 on cGVHD. Treatment of anti-CD40 mAb inhibited the production of anti-DNA IgG1 autoantibody and the development of glomerulonephritis. The inhibition of cGVHD occurred because anti-CD40 mAb prevented donor CD8(+) T cell anergy such that subsequently activated donor CD8(+) T cells deleted host CD4(+) T cells and host B cells involved in autoantibody production. Additionally, functionally activated donor CD8(+) T cells induced full engraftment of donor hematopoietic cells and exhibited an increased graft-vs-leukemia effect. However, induction of acute GVHD by donor CD8(+) T cells seemed to be not so apparent. Further CTL analysis indicated that there were lower levels of donor CTL activity against host cells in mice that received anti-CD40 mAb, compared with mice that received anti-GITR mAb. Taken together, our results suggest that a different intensity of donor CTL activity is required for removal of host hematopoietic cells, including leukemia vs induction of acute GVHD.","['Biomedical Research Center, Ulsan University Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, Republic of Korea.']","['181/10/7380 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.10.7380 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current study, we have investigated the influence of imatinib mesylate on CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cells (Treg), a critical population of lymphocytes that contributes to peripheral tolerance. Used at concentrations achieved clinically, imatinib impaired Treg immunosuppressive function and FoxP3 expression but not production of IL-10 and TGF-beta in vitro. Imatinib significantly reduced the activation of the transcription factors STAT3 and STAT5 in Treg. Analysis of Treg TCR-induced signaling cascade indicated that imatinib inhibited phosphorylation of ZAP70 and LAT. Substantiating these observations, imatinib treatment of mice decreased Treg frequency and impaired their immunosuppressive function in vivo. Furthermore, imatinib mesylate significantly enhanced antitumor immune responses to dendritic cell-based immunization against an imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL negative lymphoma. The clinical applications of imatinib mesylate might thus be expanded with its use as a potent immunomodulatory agent targeting Treg in cancer immunotherapy.","[""Department of Pediatrics, Steele Children's Research Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85724, USA. nrlarmon@email.arizona.edu""]","['181/10/6955 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.10.6955 [doi]']",,"['R01 CA104926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104926-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2579962,['NIHMS69803'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor T cells induce significant GVL when administered in large numbers to established mixed chimeras (MC). However, when using limiting numbers of T cells, we found that late transfer to MC induced less GVL than did early transfer to freshly irradiated allogeneic recipients. Late donor T cell transfer to MC was associated with marked accumulation of anti-host CD8 cells within the spleen, but delayed kinetics of differentiation, reduced expression of effector molecules including IFN-gamma, impaired cytotoxicity, and higher rates of sustained apoptosis. Furthermore, in contrast to the spleen, we observed a significant delay in donor CD8 cell recruitment to the bone marrow, a key location for hematopoietic tumors. Increasing the numbers of T cells transferred to MC led to the enhancement of CTL activity and detectable increases in absolute numbers of IFN-gamma(+) cells without inducing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). TLR-induced systemic inflammation accelerated differentiation of functional CTL in MC but was associated with severe GVHD. In the absence of inflammation, both recipient T and non-T cell populations impeded the full development of GVHD-inducing effector function. We conclude that per-cell deficits in the function of donor CD8 cells activated in MC may be overcome by transferring larger numbers of T cells without inducing GVHD.","['Transplantation Immunology Group, Department of Hematology, University College London, London, UK.']","['181/10/6820 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.181.10.6820 [doi]']",,"['P01 CA111519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA79989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the HDAC inhibitor romidepsin could cause transcriptional derepression, up-regulation of specific target genes in AML, and differentiation of the leukemic clone. The primary objectives of the study were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of romidepsin in advanced AML. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty patients were stratified into cohort A or B based on the absence or presence of chromosomal abnormalities known to recruit HDACs, including those involving core binding factor (CBF). Romidepsin was administered i.v. at 13 mg/m(2)/d on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Pharmacodynamic endpoints were evaluated at serial time points. RESULTS: Common adverse effects noted were grade 1 to 2 nausea, anorexia, and fatigue. No objective evidence of antileukemic activity was seen in cohort A. In cohort B, although there were no clinical responses by standard criteria, antileukemic activity was observed in 5 of 7 patients. Two patients had clearance of bone marrow blasts and 3 patients had a >50% decrease in bone marrow blasts. Furthermore, in cohort B, at 24 h, there was a significant increase in MDR1 (P=0.005), p15 (P=0.01), and p14 (P<0.0001) expression. In cohort A, although there was a trend toward up-regulation of MDR1, p15, and p14 expression, these changes were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Romidepsin has differential antileukemic and molecular activity in CBF AML. Development of this agent in CBF AML should focus on combinations that target related mechanisms of gene silencing such as DNA methylation.","['Medicine Studies, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois, USA. todenike@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu']","['14/21/7095 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-1007 [doi]']",,"['N01 CM062201/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01CM62201/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CM-62201/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC4498482,['NIHMS663590'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bendamustine hydrochloride is a multifunctional, alkylating agent with a purine-like ring system that exhibits activity in multiple cancer models, including CLL and MCL, but whose mechanism is only partially described. Our aim was to analyze the apoptotic pathways activated by bendamustine in CLL and MCL together with the relevance of p53 mutation in determining the response to this drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Thirteen CLL/MCL cell lines and primary tumor cells from 8 MCL and 25 CLL patients were cultured for up to 24 h with bendamustine followed by cytotoxic assays, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis of p53 response pathway and apoptosis-related factors. RESULTS: Bendamustine displayed cytotoxic activity on most CLL and MCL primary cells and cell lines irrespective of ZAP-70 expression and p53 status. Bendamustine was found to act synergistically with nucleoside analogues in both CLL and MCL, this combination being effective in p53 mutated cases resistant to standard chemotherapy. Bendamustine cytotoxicity was mediated by the generation of reactive oxygen species and triggering of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway involving up-regulation of PUMA and NOXA, conformational activation of BAX and BAK, and cytosolic release of caspase-related and caspase-unrelated mitochondrial apoptogenic proteins. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the use of bendamustine as a therapeutic agent, alone or in combination, for CLL and MCL with p53 alterations and describe the molecular basis of its activity in these entities.","[""Hematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Hospital Clinic, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.""]","['14/21/6907 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-08-0388 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concave points on the boundary and inner edges are automatically detected. A concave vertex graph is constructed from these points and edges. By minimizing a cost function based on morphological characteristics, we recursively calculate the optimal path in the graph to separate the touching cells. The algorithm is computationally efficient and has been tested on two large clinical dataset which contain 207 images and 3898 images respectively.

The mechanisms that lead to these changes at molecular level are still unknown as are the mechanisms that increase the proliferative capacity of these cells. Disorders that occur in the process of apoptosis represent one of the possible molecular mechanisms that bring about disease progress. In our study we analyzed the presence of mutated (mut) p53 gene and the amplification of Bax proteins in patients with CML. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 30 patients with CML (23 in chronic phase, 7 in blast transformation). Using immunohistochemistry with alkaline phosphatase / anti-alkaline phosphatase (APAAP) method we analyzed the expression of cell death proteins p53 and Bax in mononuclear bone marrow cells. Polymerase chain reaction single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) method was used to analyze the presence of mut p53 gene in mononuclear peripheral blood cells. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method was used to analyze the presence of Bcr-Abl in peripheral blood cells. RESULTS: High expression of Bax protein was detected in all analyzed patients, but no significant differences were noticed among them. No mut p53 gene was detected in any of the analyzed samples. Bcr-Abl b3a2 protein form was detected in all patients with variant translocations. CONCLUSION: Lack of mut p53 product in the peripheral blood and bone marrow cells in patients with CML suggests that this gene plays no important role in disease pathology. Increased level of Bax protein expression is an essential characteristic of CML cells but it is not related with the clinical stage of disease.","['Institute of Pathology, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade, Serbia. milicastrnad@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Capitalizing on the flame-spray technology for the reproducible economic large-scale production of amorphous tricalcium phosphate nanoparticulate powders (ATCP), we designed a scalable ready-to-use gravity-flow column set-up for the straightforward concentration and purification of transgenic adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, and lentiviral particles. Specific elution buffers enabled rapid release of viral particles from the ATCP matrix of the column and provided high-titer virus preparations in an unsurpassed period of time. The interaction of ATCP with adenoviral, adeno-associated viral, and lentiviral particles in solution increased the transduction kinetics of several mammalian cell lines in culture. The nanoparticles were also able to modify the tropism of murine leukemia virus (MLV) towards transduction of human cells. Based on these findings, we believe that the use of flame-spray tricalcium phosphate nanoparticles will lead to important progress in the development of future gene therapy initiatives.","['Institute for Chemical and Bioengineering, ETH Zurich, HCI F115, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['10.1002/bit.22157 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, the level of urinary 8-OHdG was examined in 116 Chinese children with acute leukemia (94 acute lymphoid leukemia, ALL, 22 acute myeloid leukemia, AML), and its correlation with urinary metal elements was investigated. Our result showed that the level of urinary 8-OHdG in children with acute leukemia before treatment was significantly elevated compared with that in normal controls (11.92 +/- 15.42 vs. 4.03 +/- 4.70 ng/mg creatinine, P < 0.05). In particular, urinary 8-OHdG was higher in children with acute leukemia aged under 3 years (20.86 +/- 21.75 ng/mg creatinine) than in those aged 3-15 years (8.09 +/- 9.65 ng/mg creatinine), whereas no differences were shown in terms of gender, parental smoking and education, household income, place of residence, and use of paracetamol. In addition, urinary 8-OHdG levels were similar among different subtypes of acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) patients. Furthermore, linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between urinary 8-OHdG and urinary Cr, but not Fe or As, in group aged <3 years compared with group aged 3-15 years (P = 0.041), indicating that the metal elements may be involved in increasing urinary 8-OHdG level in younger children with acute leukemia.

We describe the main subsets of related and unrelated HSC donors and outline the main aspects of HLA disparity and their effect on the outcome of the patients after allogeneic HSC transplantation (HSCT). The HLA match between HSCT donor and recipient is crucial, but for many patients a perfectly matched donor is not available. The HSCT from the alternative mismatched donor with one allele/antigen mismatch (9/10) can be as beneficial as a HSCT from a fully matched donor, especially in younger patients. For the remaining patients, the donors with permissive mismatches may be the option. The permissiveness depends not only on the potential adverse effect of the HLA mismatches, but also on the urgency of the transplantation, the desirable GVL effect and the potential efficacy of the alternative therapy available for the patient.","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Institute of Haematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland. szpik@ihit.waw.pl']","['bmt2008288 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.288 [doi]']",,,,,,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For patients with ALL in remission, disease-free survival at 3 years ranged between 22 and 48%.

As the paediatric experience with IMA is still very limited, many answers and algorithms are adapted from CML in adults. Basically, HSCT should be postponed to achieve an optimal tumour cell reduction by IMA treatment. Children with a low-risk EBMT score should undergo HSCT within 2 years after diagnosis to avoid prolonged exposure and unknown late effects of IMA. Without a perfectly HLA-matched donor, HSCT may be postponed until CML becomes refractory to IMA. As realized in the presently activated international trial CML-paed II, this approach represents a risk-adapted therapy with the benefit of being tailored to the needs and profile of an individual patient.","['Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital, Dresden, Germany. meinolf.suttorp@uniklinikum-dresden.de']","['bmt2008282 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.282 [doi]']",,,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this paper is to review the results obtained with first-line chemotherapy and with haematopoietic SCT (HSCT) in adolescents with ALL. Disease biology and host factors are responsible for the differences observed between adolescents and other age categories. The outcome of adolescents with ALL after first-line chemotherapy is poorer as compared with children, although better as compared with adults. Recent studies have shown that adolescents who were enrolled in paediatric trials achieved better results than those who were enrolled in adult trials. This is most likely because of several differences, including protocol design, dose intensity and use of HSCTs, as well as better compliance to treatment and better supportive care. Disparities in the attitude towards treatment between paediatric and adult wards might also contribute to the better outcome that is observed in paediatric institutions. Indications for HSCT in children with ALL are well defined by international protocols. Only very high-risk paediatric patients are eligible for HSCT in CR1, whereas in adult trials, allogeneic or autologous HSCT are frequently offered, even to standard-risk patients in CR1. The outcome of adolescents given HSCT is poorer than in children, though better than in adults. Improving both psychosocial support during therapy and physical exercise habits represent further challenges for teams involved in the treatment of adolescents. Cooperation between paediatric and adult haematologists would surely improve the ability to recruit as many patients as possible and would promote progress in the research on adolescents. In conclusion, redefining age limits according to risk-based strategies, as well as encouraging multi-centre cooperation, should be taken into consideration to improve the outcome of this age category. Adolescents should be referred to research treatment teams that have experience in the management of paediatric ALL and they should be enrolled in international cooperative studies.","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, IRCCS G Gaslini, Genoa, Italy. giorgiodini@ospedale-gaslini.ge.it']","['bmt2008281 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.281 [doi]']",,,,,,32,,['EBMT Paediatric Diseases Working Party'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consecutive post transplant MRD monitoring, together with chimerism analysis, allows the detection of impending relapse in a substantial group of children transplanted for acute leukemia.

Salvage therapy options include further chemo-radiotherapy and autologous or allogeneic haematopoietic SCT (HSCT). Autologous HSCT following high-dose chemotherapy, the standard treatment for adult patients with relapsed HL, is also effective in paediatric patients, but randomized trials showing its superiority to conventional therapy are lacking. Although patients with late relapse (>12 months after completion of therapy) may be cured with conventional therapy, those with progressive disease or early relapse (3-12 months) are considered candidates for autologous HSCT. According to patient selection criteria, overall and disease-free survival rates after autologous HSCT are 43-95% and 31-70%, respectively. Short time to relapse and refractory disease at the time of autologous HSCT remain the most important risk factors. Data on allogeneic HSCT in children with HL are scarce. Broader use has been hampered for a long time mainly by high non-relapse mortality, offsetting the advantage of a graft-vs-lymphoma effect. Data suggest that young patients with recurring disease following autologous HSCT, as well as some patients with multiple relapses and selected patients with refractory lymphoma, might benefit from allogeneic HSCT, but relapse remains the major challenge.","['Department of Paediatrics and BMT Unit, University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany. a.claviez@ped iatrics.uni-kiel.de']","['bmt2008278 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2008.278 [doi]']",,,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is counterbalanced by detrimental graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Induction of a selective suicide in donor T cells is a current gene therapy approach to abrogate GVHD. Unfortunately, genetic modification reduces alloreactivity of lymphocytes. This associates with an effector memory (T(EM)) phenotype of gene-modified lymphocytes and may limit antileukemia effect. We hypothesized that alloreactivity of gene-modified lymphocytes segregates with the central memory (T(CM)) phenotype. To this, we generated suicide gene-modified T(CM) lymphocytes with a retroviral vector after CD28 costimulation and culture with IL-2, IL-7, or a combination of IL-7 and IL-15. In vitro, suicide gene-modified T(CM) cells self-renewed upon alloantigen stimulation and resisted activation-induced cell death. In a humanized mouse model, only suicide gene-modified T cells cultured with IL-7 and IL-15 persisted, differentiated in T(EM) cells, and were as potent as unmanipulated lymphocytes in causing GVHD. GVHD was halted through the activation of the suicide gene machinery. These results warrant the use of suicide gene-modified T(CM) cells cultured with IL-7 and IL-15 for the safe exploitation of the alloreactive response against cancer.","['Experimental Hematology Unit, Cancer Immunotherapy and Gene Therapy Program, Department of Oncology, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.']","['S0006-4971(20)37774-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-156059 [doi]']",20081031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we demonstrated that genes associated with glucose metabolism are differentially expressed between prednisolone-sensitive and prednisolone-resistant precursor B-lineage leukemic patients. Here, we show that prednisolone resistance is associated with increased glucose consumption and that inhibition of glycolysis sensitizes prednisolone-resistant ALL cell lines to glucocorticoids. Treatment of prednisolone-resistant Jurkat and Molt4 cells with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), lonidamine (LND), or 3-bromopyruvate (3-BrPA) increased the in vitro sensitivity to glucocorticoids, while treatment of the prednisolone-sensitive cell lines Tom-1 and RS4; 11 did not influence drug cytotoxicity. This sensitizing effect of the glycolysis inhibitors in glucocorticoid-resistant ALL cells was not found for other classes of antileukemic drugs (ie, vincristine and daunorubicin). Moreover, down-regulation of the expression of GAPDH by RNA interference also sensitized to prednisolone, comparable with treatment with glycolytic inhibitors. Importantly, the ability of 2-DG to reverse glucocorticoid resistance was not limited to cell lines, but was also observed in isolated primary ALL cells from patients. Together, these findings indicate the importance of the glycolytic pathway in glucocorticoid resistance in ALL and suggest that targeting glycolysis is a viable strategy for modulating prednisolone resistance in ALL.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology and Hematology, Erasmus Medical Center-Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]","['S0006-4971(20)37643-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-05-157842 [doi]']",20081031,['P30 CA006973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4081395,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, a previous study found a significantly reduced risk of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) but not acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in children with Down syndrome whose mothers reported any vitamin supplement use prior to knowledge of pregnancy (ALL OR adjusted for confounders 0.51, 95% confidence limits (CL): 0.30, 0.89; AML OR adjusted for confounders 0.92, 95% CL 0.48, 1.76). Recall of exposures, including maternal vitamin supplement use, however, may be difficult and subject to error. Epidemiologists are encouraged to quantitatively adjust for systematic error in study results, but often do not. METHODS: The impact that misclassification of maternal vitamin supplement use may have had on the observed ORs in this study was quantified. Uncertainty analysis was used to calculate ORs adjusted for inaccurate reporting of vitamin supplement use under assumed probability distributions for exposure misclassification parameters. RESULTS: Given our assumptions, adjustment for exposure misclassification yielded ORs that were predominantly more protective for ALL than the crude OR. CONCLUSIONS: Uncertainty analysis can give important insights into the magnitude and direction of error in study results due to exposure misclassification.","['University of Minnesota, Department of Pediatrics, Mayo Mail Code 715, 420 Delaware St. SE, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA. jure0007@umn.edu']","['jech.2008.080226 [pii]', '10.1136/jech.2008.080226 [doi]']",20081031,"['R01 CA075169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA75169/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,['J Epidemiol Community Health. 2009 Feb;63(2):91.

No carcinogenic effects have been found in animal studies that have tested ELF MFs alone. Similarly, genotoxicity studies have generally not shown effects from MFs alone. However, ELF MFs have been reported to enhance the effects of known carcinogenic or mutagenic agents in a few animal studies and in several in vitro studies. This paper discusses the findings of studies on such combined effects. The majority of in vitro studies have reported positive findings, which supports the conclusion that MFs of 100 microT or higher interact with other chemical and physical agents. Further studies should address biophysical mechanisms and dose-response relationship below 100 microT. Animal studies designed according to the classical initiation-promotion concept may not be sufficient for studying the cocarcinogenic effects of MFs, and further studies using novel study designs would be useful. Epidemiological data on the interaction between MFs and other environmental agents are scant and inconclusive, and any further studies may be difficult because of the scarcity of subjects with suitable combined exposures.","['Department of Environmental Science, University of Kuopio, PO Box 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland. jukka.juutilainen@uku. fi']","['ncn258 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn258 [doi]']",20081030,,,,,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There has been particular concern about the possible health effects on offspring following parental preconception exposure to ionizing radiation-both occupational and therapeutic. A strong association with preconception radiation exposure in the fathers of the cases was found in a case-control study of young people with leukaemia living near the Sellafield nuclear plant in the UK. Subsequent studies of workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation have failed to confirm these findings. No statistically significant effects have been reported from studies of possible indicators of germ-cell mutagenesis in the A-bomb survivors. Studies of offspring of cancer survivors who receive radiotherapy and mutagenic chemotherapy have found no evidence of germ-cell mutagenesis. Failure to detect human germ-cell mutagenic agents may be a consequence of inadequate study sizes or insufficiently sensitive laboratory techniques.","['Childhood Cancer Research Group, University of Oxford, 57 Woodstock Road, Oxford OX2 6HJ, UK. gerald.draper@ccrg.ox.ac.uk']","['ncn256 [pii]', '10.1093/rpd/ncn256 [doi]']",20081030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After the introduction of a structured parental education programme, we examined the access of parents of children with leukaemia to donated chemotherapy in an Indonesian academic hospital. The programme consisted of a video-presentation in hospital, information-booklet, audiocassette, DVD, procedures for informed-consent, statement of understanding for donated chemotherapy and a complaints-mechanism. Of 72 new patients, 51 parents (71%) were interviewed by independent psychologists using questionnaires. Parents of 21 patients (29%) did not participate because their children dropped-out (n=10) or died (n=11) before an interview took place. Four patients had health insurance and did not need donated chemotherapy. Access to donated chemotherapy was improved: 46/47 patients (98%) received donations. Structured parental education improved the access to donated chemotherapy. Outreach-programmes may benefit from this approach. This may enable more patients from poor socio-economic backgrounds in the developing countries to receive aid and achieve cure.","['Paediatric Haematology Oncology Division, Department of Paediatrics, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. s.mostert@vumc.nl']","['S0959-8049(08)00752-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ejca.2008.09.018 [doi]']",20081106,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiments were done in ex vivo short-term cell cultures of peripheral blood cells from newly diagnosed untreated patients. We analyzed phosphorylation of histone H2AX on Ser139 (gammaH2AX), reporter of DNA damage, and expression of activated caspase-3, as a marker of apoptosis. Modest increase in expression of gammaH2AX caused by thalidomide was observed in samples of some analyzed patients. The increase in expression of gammaH2AX was also seen in leukemic TK6 cells treated with thalidomide. While treatment of CLL cells with thalidomide alone had no significant effect on apoptosis the treatment with thalidomide+fludarabine had greater than the additive effect on frequency of apoptotic cells. The data suggest that oxidative DNA damage likely induced by thalidomide sensitizes CLL cells to undergo apoptosis in response to fludarabine.","['Department of Haematooncology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Medical University of Lublin, Staszica 11, 20-081 Lublin, Poland. monika.podhorecka@am.lublin.pl']","['S0145-2126(08)00429-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.09.023 [doi]']",20081101,['CA 28 704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A constitutive NF-kappaB activity has been observed in several haematological malignancies and this is associated with its anti-apoptotic role. In the present work, the relationship between NF-kappaB and MDR phenotype was evaluated in wild type K562 human leukemic cells (K562-WT) and in its vincristine-resistant counterpart, K562-Vinc cells. These data showed that K562-Vinc cells, which express an active P-gp, exhibited MDR phenotype. The resistant indexes (IC(50)(K562-Vinc)/IC(50)(K562-WT)) for structurally unrelated drugs like imatinib, doxorubicin and colchicine were 8.0+/-0.3, 2.8+/-0.4 and 44.8+/-8.8, respectively. The imatinib resistance was reversed by P-gp blockade suggesting the involvement of P-gp in imatinib transport. We observed that NF-kappaB was constitutively activated in both cell lines but in a lesser extent in K562-Vinc. The inhibition of NF-kappaB with BAY 11-7082 increased the cytotoxicity of imatinib in K562-Vinc cells but not in K562-WT. Further, the co-administration of imatinib and BAY 11-7082 sensitized multidrug-resistant K562 cells to cell death as detected by increased percentage of annexin V positive cells. The induced cell death in K562-Vinc cells was associated with activation of caspases 9 and 3. Finally, we provide data showing that BAY 11-7082 down-regulates the expression of P-gp suggesting that the activity of NF-kappaB could be functionally associated to this protein in K562 cells. Our results indicate that the vincristine-resistant K562 cells which developed MDR phenotype, exhibited resistance to imatinib associated with a functional P-gp over-expression. This resistance could be partially overcome by the inhibition of NF-kappaB pathway.","['Laboratorio de Neurofisiologia, Instituto de Investigaciones Medicas Alfredo Lanari, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Conicet, Argentina.']","['S0145-2126(08)00428-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2008.09.024 [doi]']",20081101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid blood samples were recruited from dogs with suspected leukemia, categorized by quantitative and cytological evaluation and immunophenotyping. Flow cytometry was carried out using antibodies against CD3; CD3e; CD4; CD5; CD8; CD11a, b, c, and d; CD14; CD21; CD34; CD45 and 45RA; CD79a; CD90 (THY-1); major histocompatibility complex II; myeloperoxidase; MAC387; and neutrophil-specific antibody. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and analyzed for mutations in N, H, and K-RAS, FLT3, and C-KIT genes by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (77.0%) of 74 samples submitted from dogs with suspected leukemia had cytologically and immunophenotypically confirmed leukemia. There were 36 (63.2%) acute leukemias, 16 (28.1%) chronic, 3 (5.3%) prolymphocytic, 1 natural killer cell, and 1 chronic leukemia undergoing blast transformation. N-RAS mis-sense mutations were identified in 14 (25%) dogs with acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoid (ALL) leukemia, and also in one dog in the leukemic phase of lymphoma. Mutations in K-RAS were found in two dogs with AML. There were no H-RAS mutations. FLT3 internal tandem duplications were identified in three dogs with ALL, and a mis-sense mutation was found in one dog with ALL. C-KIT mutations were identified in three dogs with AML. Sixty-one percent of dogs with acute leukemia harbored mutations in N/K-RAS, FLT3, or C-KIT. CONCLUSION: RAS, FLT3, and C-KIT mutations, analogous to those found in human leukemia, occur commonly in acute canine leukemia.","['Small Animal Teaching Hospital, University of Liverpool, The Leahurst Campus, Neston, Wirral, UK.']","['S0301-472X(08)00433-5 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.09.005 [doi]']",20081031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infusion of donor lymphocytes (DLI) is useful for rescuing patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia, while this option is of limited value in patients with acute leukaemia. Moreover, DLI may cause fatal graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) or prolonged myelosuppression. A more sophisticated approach is that of generating and expanding ex vivo T-cell lines or clones able to selectively or preferentially lyse leukaemia blasts, while sparing non neoplastic targets. In this review, we will summarize the results we have obtained in vitro utilizing an approach based on the generation of leukaemia reactive cytotoxic T-lymphocytes through the use of apoptotic leukaemia cells as source of tumor antigens. Our approach proved to be feasible and effective in the experimental model for different types of leukaemia, even when the donor was HLA-disparate with the recipient. This strategy has to be tested in the clinical setting for proving its efficacy in preventing/treating leukaemia recurrence.","['Department of Pediatrics, Laboratory of Immunology, University of Pavia, Italy.']","['EJI797 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1744-313X.2008.00797.x [doi]']",,,,,,20,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the tissue expression profile of the minor H antigens this immune reactivity clinically results in graft-vs-host disease or in graft-vs-leukaemia effects. Targeting haematopoietic-specific minor H antigens by adoptive immunotherapy will evoke leukaemia-specific allo-immune responses, thereby enhancing graft-vs-leukaemia effects. Recently, a novel alternative role for minor H antigens in transplantation has been described; minor H antigen-specific T cells appear to be able to regulate allo-immune responses after solid organ transplantation. This diversity in immune reactivity suggests a broad clinical potential of minor H antigens, both in haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and in solid organ transplantation.","['Department of Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. e.spierings@umcutrecht.nl']","['EJI794 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1744-313X.2008.00794.x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To study the immunophenotype of increased nonneoplastic peripheral blood gammadelta T cells and to determine clinical conditions associated with this laboratory finding. DESIGN: Flow cytometric T-cell phenotyping studies performed on 352 consecutive peripheral blood specimens were reviewed, and 62 cases (18%) in which gammadelta T cells comprised either more than 5% of the total lymphocytes or had an absolute count of more than 200 cells per muL or both, were studied further. Clinical data were available from 36 cases. RESULTS: The gammadelta T cells often had an immunophenotype distinct from the alphabeta T cells, with differences in CD5 expression as the most common (n = 17), followed by differences in CD3 (n = 6) and CD7 (n = 3). CD16 coexpression by the gammadelta T cells was also frequent (n = 20). In 28 (78%) of 36 cases, there were one or more associated conditions: infection/inflammatory disease (n = 18), autoimmune disease (n = 9), lymphoproliferative disorder (n = 6), and splenectomy (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Circulating gammadelta T cells are immunophenotypically distinct from alphabeta T cells, and mild increases in these cells are not uncommon and may be associated with immune system activation and splenectomy. Recognition of this phenomenon is important because reactive gammadelta T cells can exhibit distinctive immunophenotypic features that are also encountered in neoplastic conditions, such as T-cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN55905, USA. roden.anja@mayo.edu']","['2007-0392-OA [pii]', '10.5858/132.11.1774 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Gelatin (34 to 171 kDa) was reacted with a carbodiimide to prepare G-MTX with high (G-MTX-H) and low (G-MTX-L) drug loads. Cationic conjugates were prepared by ethylenediamine modification. MTX:gelatin molar ratios were determined spectrophotometrically. Isoelectric focusing electrophoresis (IEF) and turbidity were used to measure isoelectric points (IEP). Growth inhibition profiles and IC50 values were determined on HL-60 cells using a modified MTT assay. RESULTS: IC50 values of anionic G-MTX-L (drug loads 0.5:1 to 2.2:1) increased linearly from 46 to 180 nM with MW. But, IC50 values for anionic G-MTX-H (drug loads 7.4:1 to 25:1) showed little, if any, MW dependence and were about two times higher. IC50 values for cationic G-MTX-L ranged from 770 to 2,900 nM and the relationship with MW was non-linear. CONCLUSIONS: The growth inhibition ranking was MTX>anionic G-MTX-L>anionic G-MTX-H>cationic G-MTX-L. High drug load may hinder lysosomal enzyme degradation and drug release and contribute to suppression of the MW effect observed with G-MTX-L. A mechanism change is suggested as the cationic conjugates increase to the highest MW.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, 600 South 43rd Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']",['10.1007/s11095-008-9746-5 [doi]'],20081031,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, subsets of patients lose their response to treatment through the emergence of imatinib-resistant cells, and imatinib treatment is less durable for patients with late stage CML. Although alternative Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been developed to overcome drug resistance, a cocktail therapy of different kinase inhibitors and additional chemotherapeutics may be needed for complete remission of CML in some cases.

It has also been used to prevent the hydrogen embrittlement of steel. Propargyl alcohol was nominated by the National Cancer Institute for study because of the potential for human exposure in occupational settings through inhalation and dermal contact. Male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed to propargyl alcohol (greater than 99% pure) by inhalation for 2 weeks, 3 months, or 2 years.

All males exposed to 125 ppm or greater and all females exposed to 250 or 500 ppm died by the end of day 3 of the study, and one 125 ppm female died on day 5. Mean body weights were significantly decreased in 62.5 ppm males and 125 ppm females. Clinical findings in the 125 and 250 ppm groups included lethargy, ataxia, abnormal breathing, and nasal/eye discharge. Right kidney weights of 62.5 and 125 ppm females and liver weights of 125 ppm females were significantly greater than those of the chamber controls. All 250 and 500 ppm males and females had moderate to marked periportal necrosis, congestion, and erythrophagocytosis of the liver. 2-WEEK STUDY IN MICE: Groups of five male and five female mice were exposed to propargyl alcohol vapor at concentrations of 0, 31.3, 62.5, 125, 250, or 500 ppm, 6 hours plus T(90) (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 17 days. All mice exposed to 125 ppm or greater died by day 3 of the study. Mean body weights of mice exposed to 62.5 ppm were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. Clinical findings in the 62.5 and/or 125 ppm groups included abnormal breathing, nasal/eye discharge, thinness, and lethargy. Right kidney weights of 31.3 ppm mice were significantly greater, and thymus weights of 62.5 ppm males were significantly less than those of the chamber controls. The livers of all males and females exposed to 250 or 500 ppm exhibited marked periportal necrosis, congestion, and erythrophagocytosis; these lesions also occurred in all 125 ppm males with less severity. 3-MONTH STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 10 male and 10 female rats were exposed to propargyl alcohol vapor at concentrations of 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 ppm, 6 hours plus T(90) (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All rats survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of all exposed groups were similar to those of the chamber control groups. The incidences of minimal to mild hyperplasia of respiratory epithelium of the nose were significantly increased in all exposed groups except 8 ppm males and 4 ppm females. Squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium was noted in a few males and most females exposed to 64 ppm. Necrosis of olfactory epithelium was present in half of the males and females exposed to 64 ppm and in a few males and females exposed to 32 ppm. 3-MONTH STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were exposed to propargyl alcohol vapor at concentrations of 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 ppm, 6 hours plus T(90) (12 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 14 weeks. All mice survived to the end of the study. Mean body weights of males exposed to 8 ppm or greater and 32 and 64 ppm females were significantly less than those of the chamber control groups. Histopathologic changes occurred in the nasal cavity of mice and involved both the respiratory and olfactory epithelium in groups exposed to 16 ppm or greater. Lesions included minimal to moderate suppurative inflammation, minimal to moderate squamous metaplasia of the respiratory epithelium, minimal to mild hyaline degeneration (accumulation) in the respiratory epithelium, minimal to moderate olfactory epithelial atrophy, minimal to moderate hyperplasia of glands in the olfactory region, minimal necrosis of olfactory epithelium, and minimal to moderate turbinate atrophy. There were no biologically significant differences in organ weights between exposed and chamber control groups. Reproductive tissue parameters of exposed males were similar to those of the chamber controls. Only 2/9 female mice in the 64 ppm group exhibited regular estrous cyclicity compared to 6/10 in the controls. Females exposed to 16 ppm differed from chamber controls in the relative time in the estrous stages, and 64 ppm females had a significantly increased probability of extended estrus. No gross lesions were observed at necropsy. 2-YEAR STUDY IN RATS: Groups of 50 male and 50 female rats were exposed to propargyl alcohol vapor at concentrations of 0, 16, 32, or 64 ppm, 6 hours plus T(90) (14 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival of 32 and 64 ppm males was significantly less than that of the chamber control group. Mean body weights of males exposed to 64 ppm were less than those of the chamber controls after week 24 of the study. Nasal respiratory epithelial adenomas were present in three 64 ppm males and one 32 ppm female; the incidence in 64 ppm males exceeded the historical control ranges. A spectrum of nonneoplastic lesions occurred in the respiratory and olfactory epithelium of rats at all exposure concentrations. The incidences of respiratory epithelial hyperplasia, respiratory glandular hyperplasia, and olfactory basal cell hyperplasia were significantly increased in all exposed groups of rats. The incidences of lesions of the olfactory epithelium including hyperplasia, glandular hyperplasia, atrophy, respiratory metaplasia, degeneration, necrosis, hyaline droplet accumulation, and chronic active inflammation were significantly increased in one or more exposed groups of males and/or females. The incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia was significantly increased in males exposed to 64 ppm, and the incidence exceeded the historical control ranges. 2-YEAR STUDY IN MICE: Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were exposed to propargyl alcohol vapor at concentrations of 0, 8, 16, or 32 ppm, 6 hours plus T(90) (14 minutes) per day, 5 days per week for 105 weeks. Survival of exposed groups was similar to that of the chamber control groups. Mean body weights of 16 and 32 ppm females were less than those of the chamber control group after weeks 73 and 21, respectively. Eye abnormality (unspecified) was observed after one full year of exposure with the incidence increasing in an exposure concentration-related manner. The incidences of nasal respiratory epithelial adenoma increased with a positive trend and were significantly increased in groups exposed to 32 ppm. A spectrum of nonneoplastic lesions occurred in the nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium of mice at all exposure concentrations. The incidences of respiratory epithelial hyperplasia, respiratory glandular hyperplasia, and squamous metaplasia were significantly increased in most exposed groups of mice. Suppurative inflammation was often associated with the squamous metaplasia, and turbinate atrophy was present in all exposed mice (except one 16 ppm male). The incidences of olfactory epithelial atrophy and respiratory metaplasia were increased in the 16 and 32 ppm groups. Significantly increased incidences of Harderian gland adenoma occurred in 8 and 32 ppm males. GENETIC TOXICOLOGY: Propargyl alcohol was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strain TA100 in the absence of liver S9 activation enzymes only; no mutagenicity was observed in TA100 in the presence of S9 enzymes, in TA1535 without S9, or in TA98 with or without S9. In vivo, no significant increases in the frequencies of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were observed in peripheral blood samples from male mice exposed by inhalation to propargyl alcohol for 3 months. In female mice, propargyl alcohol exposure produced a small increase in micronucleated erythrocytes that was judged to be equivocal. No significant changes in the percentage of polychromatic erythrocytes were seen in either male or female mice after 3 months of exposure to propargyl alcohol. CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of these 2-year inhalation studies, there was some evidence of carcinogenetic activity of propargyl alcohol in male F344/N rats based on increased incidences of nasal respiratory epithelial adenoma and mononuclear cell leukemia. There was no evidence of carcinogenic activity of propargyl alcohol in female F344/N rats exposed to 16, 32, or 64 ppm. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of propargyl alcohol in male and female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of nasal respiratory epithelial adenoma. The increased incidences of Harderian gland adenoma in male B6C3F1 mice may have been related to exposure to propargyl alcohol. Exposure to propargyl alcohol resulted in increased incidences of nonneoplastic nasal lesions in male and female rats and mice.

Blockade of the CTLA4 molecule can effectively augment antitumor immunity mediated by autologous effector T cells. We have assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of a neutralizing, human anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab, in stimulating the graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effect after allo-HCT. Twenty-nine patients with malignancies that were recurrent or progressive after allo-HCT, received ipilimumab as a single infusion at dose cohorts between 0.1 and 3.0 mg/kg. Dose-limiting toxicity was not encountered, and ipilimumab did not induce graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or graft rejection. Organ-specific immune adverse events (IAE) were seen in 4 patients (grade 3 arthritis, grade 2 hyperthyroidism, recurrent grade 4 pneumonitis). Three patients with lymphoid malignancy developed objective disease responses following ipilimumab: complete remission (CR) in 2 patients with Hodgkin disease and partial remission (PR) in a patient with refractory mantle cell lymphoma. At the 3.0 mg/kg dose, active serum concentrations of ipilimumab were maintained for more than 30 days after a single infusion. Ipilimumab, as administered in this clinical trial, does not induce or exacerbate clinical GVHD, but may cause organ-specific IAE and regression of malignancy.

It has been known for a long time that exposure of cells to radiation results in extensive DNA damage; however, a small number of studies have tried to explain the mechanisms of radiation-induced carcinogenesis. The high prevalence of RET/PTC rearrangements in patients who have received external radiation, and the evidence of in vitro induction of RET rearrangements in human cells, suggest an enhanced sensitivity of the RET genomic region to damage by ionizing radiation. To assess whether RET is indeed more sensitive to radiations than other genomic regions, we used a COMET assay coupled with fluorescence in situ hybridization, which allows the measurement of DNA fragmentation in defined genomic regions of single cells. We compared the initial DNA damage of the genomic regions of RET, CXCL12/SDF1, ABL, MYC, PLA2G2A, p53, and JAK2 induced by ionizing radiation in both a lymphoblastoid and a fetal thyroid cell line. In both cell lines, RET fragmentation was significantly higher than in other genomic regions. Moreover, a differential distribution of signals within the COMET was associated with a higher percentage of RET fragments in the tail. RET was more susceptible to fragmentation in the thyroid-derived cells than in lymphoblasts. This enhanced susceptibility of RET to ionizing radiation suggests the possibility of using it as a radiation exposure marker.","['Institute of Genetic Medicine, European Academy, Bolzano, Italy.']","['68/21/8986 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1032 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analyses of 11 different profiles revealed six miRNAs that were consistently up-regulated.

Pbx1 expression is transcriptionally regulated by Notch3 activation, and Notch3/CSL protein complex directly binds to the Pbx1 promoter segment harboring the CSL-binding sequence. The growth-inhibitory effect of gamma-secretase inhibitor could be partially reversed by ectopic Pbx1 expression.

Taken together, the above findings indicate that Pbx1 is a direct Notch3-regulated gene that mediates the survival signal of Notch3 in ovarian cancer.","['Department of Pathology, Pathobiology Graduate Program, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']","['68/21/8852 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-0517 [doi]']",,"['CA103937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129080-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA098252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103937-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA129080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA098252/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA129080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA103937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2636690,['NIHMS85728'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This communication reports that expression of the Cbl adaptor caused enhanced extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 activation and promoted RA-induced differentiation and G(0)-arrest. Stable transfectants ectopically expressing c-Cbl underwent myeloid differentiation faster than wild-type (wt) cells when treated with RA. In contrast, c-Cbl knockdown stable transfectants differentiated slower than wt cells when treated with RA. Cells ectopically expressing c-Cbl had enhanced CD38 expression when treated with RA, and cells ectopically expressing CD38 had enhanced c-Cbl expression, even without with RA, suggesting an interaction between c-Cbl and CD38. Fluorescence resource energy transfer and coimmunoprecipitation showed that c-Cbl and CD38 bind each other. RA causes the gradual down-regulation and eventual loss of c-Cbl expression, resulting in loss of the Cbl-CD38 interaction, suggesting that c-Cbl plays a relatively early role in promoting RA-induced differentiation. RA-induced differentiation can thus be propelled by c-Cbl and by CD38, both of which bind together, enhance the expression of each other, and cause MAPK signaling. There thus seems to be a cooperative role for c-Cbl and CD38, reflected in their direct binding, in propulsion of RA-induced differentiation.","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']","['68/21/8761 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-08-1058 [doi]']",,['R01 CA033505/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4896297,['NIHMS790262'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report our institutional retrospective study that evaluates the frequency of acute and chronic renal dysfunction in children after using total body irradiation (TBI) conditioning regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1995 and 2003, 60 children with hematological malignancies underwent TBI as part of a conditioning regimen before allogeneic BMT. Patients received 4-14Gy at 1.75-2Gy/fraction in six-eight fractions. Lung shielding was used in all patients to limit lung dose to less than 10Gy; renal shielding was not utilized. All patients had baseline renal function assessment and renal dysfunction post-BM was mainly evaluated on the basis of persistent serum creatinine elevation at acute (0-90 days) and chronic (>90 days) intervals after completion of BMT. RESULTS: Acute renal dysfunction (ARD) was documented in 27 patients (45%); the majority had concurrent diagnosis of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and other potential causes (sepsis, antibiotic). The risk for delayed renal dysfunction (DRD) at 1 year approached 25% for surviving patients. The ARD was strongly linked with the risk of the DRD. There was no statistically significant relationship between ARD, DRD and underlying diagnosis, GVHD, VOD or TBI doses with both univariate and multivariate analyses. The younger age (<5 years) had significantly increased risk for the development of ARD (p=0.011). CONCLUSION: Our analysis validates high incidence of renal dysfunction in the pediatric BMT population. In contrast to other reports we did not find total body irradiation dose to be a risk factor for renal dysfunction. Future prospective studies are needed to assess risk factors and interventions for this serious toxicity in children following allogeneic BM.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, CA 30322, USA. natia@radonc.emory.org']","['S0167-8140(08)00516-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.radonc.2008.09.017 [doi]']",20081028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are many elaborate approaches to this problem, it is still difficult to select a reasonable set of informative genes for tumor diagnosis only with microarray data. In this paper, we classify the genes expressed through microarray data into a number of clusters via the distance sensitive rival penalized competitive learning (DSRPCL) algorithm and then detect the informative gene cluster or set with the help of support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the critical or powerful informative genes can be found through further classifications and detections on the obtained informative gene clusters. It is well demonstrated by experiments on the colon, leukemia, and breast cancer datasets that our proposed DSRPCL-SVM approach leads to a reasonable selection of informative genes for tumor diagnosis.","['School of Mathematical Sciences and Laboratory of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (LMAM), Peking University, Beijing 100871, China.']","['S1672-0229(08)60023-6 [pii]', '10.1016/S1672-0229(08)60023-6 [doi]']",,,PMC5054100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, gene selection is known to be a very difficult task since gene expression data not only have high dimensionalities, but also contain redundant information and noises. To cope with these difficulties, this paper introduces a fuzzy logic based pre-processing approach composed of two main steps. First, we use fuzzy inference rules to transform the gene expression levels of a given dataset into fuzzy values. Then we apply a similarity relation to these fuzzy values to define fuzzy equivalence groups, each group containing strongly similar genes. Dimension reduction is achieved by considering for each group of similar genes a single representative based on mutual information. To assess the usefulness of this approach, extensive experimentations were carried out on three well-known public datasets with a combined classification model using three statistic filters and three classifiers.","[""LERIA, Universite d'Angers, 2 Boulevard Lavoisier, 49045 Angers, France.""]","['S1672-0229(08)60021-2 [pii]', '10.1016/S1672-0229(08)60021-2 [doi]']",,,PMC5054105,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression and the regulation of HOX cofactors in human ovaries are unknown. METHODS: In this study, the expression of HOX cofactors, PBX1, PBX2, and MEIS1/2, were examined by using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence in cultured immortalized human granulosa (SVOG) cells. The distribution of these HOX cofactors in human ovaries was examined by immunohistochemistry. The effects of growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on PBX2 in SVOG cells were investigated by western blot analysis. Binding activities of HOXA7 and PBX2 to the specific sequences in granulosa cells were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: In SVOG cells, PBX1, PBX2 and MEIS1/2 were expressed during cell culture. In normal human ovaries, PBX1 and MEIS1/2 were expressed in granulosa cells at essentially all stages of follicular development. These cofactors were expressed in the nuclei of the granulosa cells from the primordial to the secondary follicles, whereas beyond multilayered follicles was observed in the cytoplasm. The co-expression of PBX1 and MEIS1/2 in granulosa cells in normal human ovaries suggested that MEIS1/2 might control PBX1 sublocalization, as seen in other systems. PBX2 was not expressed or weakly expressed in the primordial follicles. From the primary follicles to the preovulatory follicles, PBX2 expression was inconsistent and the expression was found in the granulosa cell nuclei. The PBX2 expression pattern is similar to HOXA7 expression in ovarian follicular development. Furthermore, FSH down-regulated, GDF-9 did not change PBX2 expression, but co-treatment of the granulosa cells with FSH and GDF-9 up-regulated PBX2 expression. These results implicated a role for PBX2 expression in the steroidogenic activities of granulosa cells in humans. Moreover, PBX2 and HOXA7 bound together to the Pbx sequence, but not to the EMX2 promoter sequence, in SVOG cells. Our findings indicate that HOX cofactors expression in normal human ovary is temporally and spatially specific and regulated by FSH and GDF-9 in granulosa cells. HOX proteins may use different HOX cofactors, depending on DNA sequences that are specific to the granulosa cells.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, V6H 3V5, Canada. takayo.ota@gmail.com']","['1477-7827-6-49 [pii]', '10.1186/1477-7827-6-49 [doi]']",20081030,,PMC2585084,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the response of human macrophage-like cells to stimulation by peptidoglycan isolated from T. denticola. We also studied the effect of the peptidoglycan preparation on the phosphorylation state of kinases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Monoblastic leukemia cells (U937 strain) were differentiated into adherent macrophage-like cells using phorbol myristic acid prior to being stimulated for 6 or 24 h with various amounts of T. denticola peptidoglycan. Secreted inflammatory mediators were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The phosphorylation state of kinases was determined by immunoblotting. RESULTS: The T. denticola peptidoglycan preparation, which was non-toxic for macrophage-like U937 leukemia cells at the concentration used, significantly increased, in a dose-dependent manner, the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-1beta and interleukin-6. It also increased the secretion of two potent chemokines, interleukin-8 (IL-8) and regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES).

The phosphorylation state of several kinases, including extracellular regulated protein-serine kinase 2 (+99%), G protein-coupled receptor-serine kinase 2 (+50%), Yes-related protein-tyrosine kinase (+44%) and extracellular regulated protein-serine kinase 1 (+30%) also increased following stimulation with the peptidoglycan preparation.

Genetic alterations that underlie each mutant model can exist in the form of single base changes, balanced chromosomal rearrangements, or genetic imbalances. To detect genetic imbalances in an unbiased genome-wide fashion, array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) can be used. We have developed a 5-Mb resolution array CGH platform specifically for the zebrafish. This platform contains 286 bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones, enriched for orthologous sequences of human oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Each BAC clone has been end-sequenced and cytogenetically assigned to a specific location within the zebrafish genome, allowing for ease of integration of array CGH data with the current version of the genome assembly. This platform has been applied to three zebrafish cancer models. Significant genomic imbalances were detected in each model, identifying different regions that may potentially play a role in tumorigenesis. Hence, this platform should be a useful resource for genetic dissection of additional zebrafish developmental and disease models as well as a benchmark for future array CGH platform development.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]",['10.1002/gcc.20623 [doi]'],,"['R01 CA111560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA111560-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA111560/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2605212,['NIHMS76494'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary lymphomas of the gynecologic tract are reported to represent less than 1% of extranodal non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL), and the majority of them being B-cell in origin. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common subtype, whereas primary extraosseus plasmacytoma of the genital tract is rare.If clinically not suspected, these rare tumors pose a diagnostic challenge both for clinicians and pathologists. Clinical symptoms are often nonspecific and mimic other more common gynecologic malignancies such as squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix or endometrial adenocarcinoma. Although cervico-vaginal (Pap) smear is the primary screening method for cervical squamous cell carcinoma and its precursors, it is far less sensitive for detection of other primary or metastatic malignancies. In this review, we present three cases of hematologic gynecologic malignancies, two cases of primary NHL, and a case of acute myeloid leukemia with relapse as a pelvic mass, all of which were diagnosed on a liquid-based Pap test. In addition, we discuss the morphologic features of differential diagnostic entities of these rare tumors on conventional and liquid-based preparations.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Virginia Health System, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. kzh2b@virginia.edu']",['10.1002/dc.20994 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['(c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

Small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (SLL/CLL) in particular is associated with an increased incidence of secondary tumor, likely due to associated immunodeficiency. Co-occurrence of some carcinomas such as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), may show especially aggressive behavior. A 57-year-old Caucasian male presented with recurrent upper extremity lymphedema and diffuse lymphadenopathy of the axillary and cervical regions. FNA of a large cervical lymph node was diagnostic for both atypical lymphocytic proliferation and SCC. Flow cytometric analysis showed the atypical lymphocytic proliferation to be positive for CD5, CD23, CD19, CD20, HLA-DR, CD38, and the population was kappa light chain restricted. These cells were negative for CD-10 and FMC-7 antigens, suggesting a phenotype of B-cell SLL/CLL. We report a rare occurrence of metastatic SCC to a lymph node infiltrated by SLL/CLL. The diagnosis was achieved by a combination of cytomorphologic examination of FNA smears, immunohistochemical staining of cell block material, and flow cytometry on the sample obtained by FNA. To the best of our knowledge, only three cases of SCC metastasis to SLL/CLL diagnosed by FNA have been reported in the English literature.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the records of 975 patients, ranging in age from 0 to 88 years, who displayed facial palsy at Kyung Hee Medical Center between January 1986 and July 2005. RESULTS: The most frequent causes of facial palsy in adults were Bell's palsy (54.9%), infection (26.8%), trauma (5.9%), iatrogenic (2.0%), and tumors (1.8%), whereas the most frequent causes of facial palsy in children were Bell's palsy (66.2%), infection (14.6%), trauma (13.4%), birth trauma (3.2%), and leukemia (1.3%). Recovery rates in adults were 91.4% for Bell's palsy, 89.0% for infection, and 64.3% for trauma, whereas recovery rates in children were 93.1% for Bell's palsy, 90.9% for infection, and 42.9% for trauma.

Compound 1 is more effective than compound 2 in inhibiting the growth of K562 cells with the IC(50) values of 14.44 and 34.54 microM, respectively. There is a good correlation between cell-growth inhibition and intracellular metal concentrations, determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Incubation of the cells with equitoxic concentrations of both compounds yields approximately the same intracellular Pd concentration. At the IC(50) doses, intracellular concentration is ca. 33 x 10(-16) mol/cell for both compounds 1 and 2. This suggests that more [Pd(Tc)Cl2] is needed to produce a cytotoxic effect, because it enters cells more slowly.

The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at 11 years of age and had received an allogeneic bone marrow transplant from a female donor. Further investigation of the tissue specimens by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that an XX chromosome pattern was dominant in the tumor region, and this suggested that donor-derived cells might affect carcinogenesis in the recipient.

The study of signal transduction was revolutionized through the development of phospho-specific antibodies that recognize proteins only when they are phosphorylated at specific sites. As discussed by Nolan and co-workers (UNIT ), one of the unique features of flow cytometry is its ability to perform correlated measurements of multiple phosphorylation states at the single cell level. This provides insight into the complexity of signaling networks that is not obtained by standard biochemical techniques. Furthermore, in combination with other phenotypic markers, flow cytometry can measure alterations in signaling pathways in subpopulations of cells. This clearly has wide potential for studying disorders of the hematopoietic and immune systems.","['Division of Applied Molecular Oncology, Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['10.1002/0471142956.cy0927s46 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Copyright 2008 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.']",,,,,,,,

To identify novel imatinib-sensitive lesions, we screened 11 BCR-ABL-negative cell lines and identified GDM1, derived from a patient with an atypical MPN (aMPN), as being responsive to imatinib. Screening of genes encoding known imatinib targets revealed an exon 12 mutation in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R; c-FMS) with a predicted Y571D amino-acid substitution. CSF1R in GDM1 was constitutively phosphorylated, but rapidly dephosphorylated on exposure to imatinib. Y571D did not transform FDCP1 cells to growth factor independence, but resulted in a significantly increased colony growth compared with controls, constitutive CSF1R phosphorylation and elevated CSF1R signaling. We found that GDM1 expresses CSF1, and CSF1 neutralization partially inhibited proliferation, suggesting the importance of both autocrine and intrinsic mechanisms of CSF1R activation. An extensive screen of CSF1R in aMPNs and acute myeloid leukemia identified three additional novel missense variants. None of these variants were active in transformation assays and are therefore likely to be previously unreported rare polymorphisms or non-pathogenic passenger mutations.","['Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury and Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK. achase@soton.ac.uk']","['leu2008295 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.295 [doi]']",20081030,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of the study was to evaluate elastin metabolism before and at two time-points after HSCT. MATERIAL/METHODS: Forty patients (22 male and 18 female, median age: 34 years, range: 14-54) were included. The diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (AML, n=25) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML, n=15). Busulfan and cyclophosphamide (4+2) were administered as conditioning. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine and methotrexate. Twenty-three patients experienced acute GVHD and 17 developed chronic GVHD. Plasma elastase activity (EA) and plasma elastin-derived peptide concentration (EDPc) were measured. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences in EA before HSCT (1.3 U/ml) compared with day +30 (2.9 U/ml) and day +100 (3.2 U/ml) after HSCT (p<0.001 for both). EA was also higher in patients with chronic GVHD than in those who did not develop chronic GVHD. EDPc was significantly higher on days +30 (49.3 U/ml) and +100 (57.7 U/ml) after HSCT than on day -10 before HSCT (15.5 U/ml, p<0.001 for both). EDPc was significantly higher in patients with chronic GVHD. CONCLUSIONS: EA and EDPc were increased in patients after HSCT. If the role of elastase in the pathogenesis of GVHD is confirmed, it will be possible to apply inhibitors of elastases in the treatment of this condition in the near future.","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland. ghelbig@tlen.pl']",['869447 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We developed a mouse model of spontaneous lymphoma in which malignant transformation is coupled with light emission that can be detected noninvasively using bioluminescent imaging. The human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) type 1 transcriptional transactivator Tax is an oncogene sufficient to produce lymphoma in transgenic animal models. Using the granzyme B promoter to restrict Tax expression to the mature natural killer (NK)/T-cell compartment, we have reproduced many elements of HTLV-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Tax activates signaling cascades associated with transformation, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. Here, we report that Tax-mediated activation of luciferase in long terminal repeat-luciferase (LTR-LUC) mice serves as a reporter for imaging these processes in vivo. Using bioluminescent imaging (BLI), we discovered that microscopic intraepithelial lesions precede the onset of peripheral subcutaneous tumors, tumorigenesis progresses through early reversible stages, and Tax is sufficient for inducing tumors. Based on these findings, we propose that Tax expression in activated lymphocytes initiates a cascade of events that leads to NK/T cell recruitment, activation, and transformation. The use of BLI expands our ability to interrogate the role of Tax in tumorigenesis in vivo and has made the association of inflammation with tumor initiation amenable for study.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Molecular Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)37717-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-166462 [doi]']",20081029,"['P50 CA094056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10073/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA10521/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA063417/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA94056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2644076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunoblot analysis showed that A1s were efficiently incorporated into the HIV-1 virion, and their packaging is mediated through an interaction with the nucleocapsid Gag domain.

However, the justification for this view has been challenged. We therefore report on the relationship between CLL mortality and external ionizing radiation dose within the 15-country nuclear workers cohort study. The analyses included, in seven countries with CLL deaths, a total of 295,963 workers with more than 4.5 million person-years of follow-up and an average cumulative bone marrow dose of 15 mSv; there were 65 CLL deaths in this cohort. The relative risk (RR) at an occupational dose of 100 mSv compared to 0 mSv was 0.84 (95% CI 0.39, 1.48) under the assumption of a 10-year exposure lag. Analyses of longer lag periods showed little variation in the RR, but they included very small numbers of cases with relatively high doses. In conclusion, the largest nuclear workers cohort study to date finds little evidence for an association between low doses of external ionizing radiation and CLL mortality. This study had little power due to low doses, short follow-up periods, and uncertainties in CLL ascertainment from death certificates; an extended follow-up of the cohorts is merited and would ideally include incident cancer cases.","['International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France. mvrijheid@creal.cat']","['RR1443 [pii]', '10.1667/RR1443.1 [doi]']",,"['ZIA CP010133-18/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', '211-2004-M-08102/PHS HHS/United States', 'U50/CCU011778/PHS HHS/United States']",PMC4051434,['NIHMS580173'],,,,['15-Country Study Group'],,,,"['Engels H', 'Turai I', 'Veress K', 'Yoshimura T', 'Hosada Y', 'Ahn YO', 'Bae JM', 'Kurtinaitis J', 'Gulis G', 'Bernar JS', 'Rodriguez-Artalejo J', 'Moser M', 'Usel M', 'Howe G']","['Engels, H', 'Turai, I', 'Veress, K', 'Yoshimura, T', 'Hosada, Y', 'Ahn, Y-O', 'Bae, J-M', 'Kurtinaitis, J', 'Gulis, G', 'Bernar, J S', 'Rodriguez-Artalejo, J', 'Moser, M', 'Usel, M', 'Howe, G']",,,,,,,,,

Several fractions obtained by silica gel column chromatography inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in HL60 cells. Among them, fraction 7 had the strongest activity in inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis in HL60 cells. A component that induced apoptosis in HL60 cells was then isolated from fraction 7 by another silica gel column chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a C18 column and was identified as (9Z,11E,13E)-15,16-dihydroxy-9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid (15,16-dihydroxy alpha-eleostearic acid). 15,16-Dihydroxy alpha-eleostearic acid induced apoptosis in HL60 cells within 5 h at a concentration of 160 microM (50 microg/mL).

The diagnosis was based on prolonged fever, elevated serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, as well as characteristic lesions on computed tomography, nuclear magnetic resonance and ultrasonographic findings and positive blood culture in one patient. The antifungal treatment was successful in one patient only. Two patients died due to progression of leukaemia. CONCLUSION: If leukaemia patient in remission after chemotherapy develops a prolonged fever of unknown origin, hepatosplenic candidiasis has to be considered and all efforts should be done to diagnose it. The diagnosis is based on clinical presentation and imaging techniques. The positive cultures of fungi are not usually possible and are not mandatory.

Incidence of disease is around 1:40-60,000 inhabitants and it is assuming that in Croatia we have 20-30 patients with Morbus Gaucher. Morbus Gaucher is recognized in three types. Type I or so called non-neuropatic from is most common in Europe while so called neuropatic forms (type II and III) are much rare (5-10%). Type II and III are characterized by central nervous system involvement and usually are diagnosed in childhood. Disease manifestations are observed in various human organs. The most common disease features are involved liver, spleen, bones, lungs and brain. Enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) is now day's therapeutic gold standard. Imiglucerase prevents progressive manifestation of disease and patients have normal life. Cost of the treatment is high due to the cost of the recombinant technology which was used to product imiglucerase. The cost of the enzyme replacement therapy is 150-200,000 EUR per year for imiglucerase in a typical adult patient. Because of high cost for the patient treatment Ministry of Health of Republic of Croatia, and Croatian Health Insurance Company in year 2002. established a special program for so called ""Expensive drug treatment"". This program covering treatment costs for patients with inherited metabolic disorders, adenosine deaminase deficiency, chronic myeloid leukemia, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, juvenile arthritis and ovarian cancer. Until now 11 adult patients and 2 children with Gaucher disease were diagnosed in Croatia and all are on enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase. According to our experience administration of imiglucerase decreased spleen and liver size and number of bone pain crisis as well as normalization of platelet and red blood cells. Administration of the imiglucerase do no revert bone changes e.g. avascular hip necrosis or vertebra collapses, but prevent further bone deterioration. According to this, treatment with imiglucerase should be started immediately after establishing diagnosis to prevent irreversible changes on human organs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,Dijagnoza i lijecenje Morbus Gaucher u hrvatskoj.,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: From April 2002 till April 2008 about 10 500 abdominal examinations were performed by a single physician in our interdisciplinary ultrasound unit. During this time, n = 100 patients (62 male/ 38 female) with periportal cuffing of the liver were detected qualifying for the retrospective study design. Echomorphology of periportal cuffing was evaluated and clinical diagnoses of the underlying diseases were clustered in four main groups: Liver diseases, haematological diseases, bowel diseases and others. Furthermore, liver function tests and body mass index were determined. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 57.06 years (SD +/- 19.47). Mean body-mass-index was 24.76 kg/m (2) (SD +/- 4.28). Periportal cuffing was echo-poor in n = 9 (9 %) and echo-rich in n = 91 (91 %). Echo-poor periportal cuffing was significantly more often associated with malignant diseases as compared to echo-rich periportal cuffing (78 vs. 36 %) (p < 0.025). Liver diseases (n = 33) were malign n = 10 (10 %), autoimmune n = 8 (8 %), infectious n = 8 (8 %) and cholestatic n = 7 (7 %). Bowel diseases (n = 34) originated from the upper gastrointestinal tract n = 7 (7 %), lower gastrointestinal tract n = 21 (21 %) and the pancreas n = 6 (6 %). Haematological disorders (n = 15, 15 %) were chronic myeloproliferative n = 2 (2 %), lymphoma n = 8 (8 %), leukemia n = 4 (4 %) and miscellaneous n = 1 (1 %). Other diseases accounted for 18 (18 %) of cases. Aspartat-aminotrasferase (AST) and alanin-aminotransferase (ALT) were elevated in 39 patients (40 %) and 34 patients (35 %), respectively. Total bilirubin was elevated in 35 patients (36 %). Alkaline phosphatase (AP) was detected above normal range in 49 patients (50 %) whereas g-glutamyl-transferase was elevated in 58 patients (59 %). CONCLUSION: Periportal cuffing of the liver is an extremely rare ultrasonographic phenomenon with a prevalence of approximately 0.95 % in our unit.

In previous work we have shown that addition of monocytes and rFVIIa to microparticle free plasma causes a distinct thrombin generation.

PATIENTS, METHODS: Thrombin generation was measured in platelet rich plasma (PRP) and microparticle free plasma (MFP) of thrombocytopenic haemato-oncological patients with and without addition of rVIIa by means of calibrated automated thrombography. Microparticles were analyzed in PRP by FACS flow cytometry. RESULTS: Microparticle free plasma showed no thrombin generation with or without addition of rFVIIa. Addition of rFVIIa to PRP of thrombocytopenic patients led to a significant shortening of lag time and time to peak in thrombin generation, while ETP and peak remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Our results show that even in plasma of severe thrombocytopenic patients enough surface may be provided by microparticles to allow an enhancement of thrombin generation by rFVIIa.","['Allgemeine Padiatrie, Universitatsklinik fur Kinder- und, Jugendheilkunde, Medizinische Universitat Graz, Auenbruggerplatz 30, 8036 Graz, Austria.']",['0814a0S77 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relevant mouse models of human uveal melanoma still remain to be developed. We have studied the transgenic mouse strain, Tyrp-1-TAg, to try to gain insight into possible molecular mechanisms common to pigmented ocular neoplasms occurring spontaneously in the eyes of these mice and human choroidal melanoma. The role of two members of the ETS (E26 avian leukemia oncogene) family of transcription factors, ETS-1 and ETS-2, has been investigated in many cancers but has not yet been studied in ocular tumors. METHODS: This is the first study describing the production and distribution of ETS-1 and ETS-2 mRNAs and proteins using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in murine ocular tissue sections of normal control eyes and tumoral eyes from mice of the same age. Using semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blots experiments, we compared changes in ETS-1 and ETS-2 expression, their protein levels, and the regulation of some of their target gene expressions at different stages of the ocular tumoral progression in the transgenic mouse model, Tyrp-1-TAg, with those in normal eyes from control mice of the same age. RESULTS: In normal control adult mouse eyes, ETS-1 was mostly present in the nuclei of all neuroretinal layers whereas ETS-2 was mostly localized in the cytosol of the cell bodies of these layers with a smaller amount present in the nuclei. Both were found in the retinal pigmentary epithelium (RPE). ETS-1 and ETS-2 mRNA and protein levels were much higher in the ocular tissues of Tyrp-1-TAg mice than in control ocular tissues from wild-type mice. This upregulation was correlated with tumor progression. We also demonstrated upregulation of ETS-1 and ETS-2 target expressions in Tyrp-1-TAg mice when comparing with the same target expressions in control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ETS-1 and ETS-2 are upregulated in ocular tumors derived from the retinal epithelium and may be involved in one or several signaling pathways that activate the expression of a set of genes involved in ocular tumor progression such as those encoding ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1), PAI-1 (Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1), MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) and p16 (Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2A).","['Universite Paris-Descartes, Centre de Recherches Theapeutiques en Ophtalmologie de la Facultede Meecine Paris-Descartes-site Necker (CERTO), AP-HP, Hopital Necker Enfants-Malades, Paris, France.']",,20081029,,PMC2573735,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), elevated expression of CXCR4 has been shown to correlate with shortened survival. Hy-poxia increases CXCR4 in several tumor models, but the impact of reduced O(2) partial pressure (pO(2)) on expression and biologic function of CXCR4 in AML is unknown. We determined pO(2) in bone marrows of AML patients as 6.1% (+/-1.7%). At this pO(2), CXCR4 surface and total expression were up-regulated within 10 hours in leukemic cell lines and patient samples as shown by Western blotting, fluorescence-activated cell sorting, and microscopy. Interestingly, hypoxic cells failed to internalize CXCR4 in response to SDF-1, and upon reoxygenation at 21% O(2), surface and total expression of CXCR4 rapidly decreased independent of adenosine triphosphate or proteasome activity. Instead, increased pO(2) led to alteration of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion and structural changes and was associated with increased shedding of CXCR4-positive microparticles, suggesting a novel mechanism of CXCR4 regulation. Given the importance of CXCR4 in cell signaling, survival, and adhesion in leukemia, the results suggest that pO(2) be considered a critical variable in conducting and interpreting studies of CXCR4 expression and regulation in leukemias.","['Department of Molecular Hematology & Therapy and Stem Cell Transplantation & Cellular Therapy and Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)37719-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-161539 [doi]']",20081028,"['P01 CA055164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2644078,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we use the example of dicentric chromosomes in B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia to show that, despite this heterogeneity, single genes are targeted through a variety of mechanisms. FISH showed that, although they were heterogeneous, breakpoints on 9p resulted in the partial or complete deletion of PAX5. Molecular copy number counting further delineated the breakpoints and facilitated cloning with long-distance inverse PCR. This approach identified 5 fusion gene partners with PAX5: LOC392027 (7p12.1), SLCO1B3 (12p12), ASXL1 (20q11.1), KIF3B (20q11.21), and C20orf112 (20q11.1). In each predicted fusion protein, the DNA-binding paired domain of PAX5 was present. Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrated that both the deletion and gene fusion events resulted in the same underexpression of PAX5, which extended to the differential expression of the PAX5 target genes, EBF1, ALDH1A1, ATP9A, and FLT3. Further molecular analysis showed deletion and mutation of the homologous PAX5 allele, providing further support for the key role of PAX5. Here, we show that specific gene loci may be the target of heterogeneous translocation breakpoints in human cancer, acting through a variety of mechanisms. This approach indicates an application for the identification of cancer genes in solid tumours, where unbalanced chromosomal rearrangements are particularly prevalent and few genes have been identified. It can be extrapolated that this strategy will reveal that the same mechanisms operate in cancer pathogenesis in general.","['Cancer Genomics and Leukaemia Research Cytogenetics Groups, Cancer Sciences Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, SO16 6YD, United Kingdom.']","['0803494105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0803494105 [doi]']",20081028,,PMC2579376,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of Tax induced foci formation and phosphorylation of H2AX. However, Tax-induced constitutive signaling of the DNA-PK pathway impaired cellular response to new damage, as reflected in suppression of ionizing radiation-induced DNA-PK phosphorylation and gammaH2AX stabilization. Tax co-localized with phospho-DNA-PK into nuclear speckles and a nuclear excluded Tax mutant sequestered endogenous phospho-DNA-PK into the cytoplasm, suggesting that Tax interaction with DNA-PK is an initiating event. We also describe a novel interaction between DNA-PK and Chk2 that requires Tax. We propose that Tax binds to and stabilizes a protein complex with DNA-PK and Chk2, resulting in a saturation of DNA-PK-mediated damage repair response.","['Department of Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology, Center for Biomedical Proteomics, Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, Virginia 23507, USA.']","['S0021-9258(20)49638-3 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M804931200 [doi]']",20081027,"['R01 CA076595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-76595/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2605996,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are at least 21 B subunit family members. Thus PP2A is actually a family of enzymes defined by which B subunit is used. The B56 family member B56alpha is a phosphoprotein that regulates dephosphorylation of BCL2. The stress kinase PKR has been shown to phosphorylate B56alpha at serine 28 in vitro, but it has been unclear how PKR might regulate the BCL2 phosphatase. In the present study, PKR regulation of B56alpha in REH cells was examined, because these cells exhibit robust BCL2 phosphatase activity. PKR was found to be basally active in REH cells as would be predicted if the kinase supports B56alpha-mediated dephosphorylation of BCL2. Suppression of PKR promoted BCL2 phosphorylation with concomitant loss of B56alpha phosphorylation at serine 28 and inhibition of mitochondrial PP2A activity. PKR supports stress signaling in REH cells, as suppression of PKR promoted chemoresistance to etoposide. Suppression of PKR promoted B56alpha proteolysis, which could be blocked by a proteasome inhibitor. However, the mechanism by which PKR supports B56alpha protein does not involve PKR-mediated phosphorylation of the B subunit at serine 28 but may involve eIF2alpha activation of AKT. Phosphorylation of serine 28 by PKR promotes mitochondrial localization of B56alpha, because wild-type but not mutant S28A B56alpha promoted mitochondrial PP2A activity. Cells expressing wild-type B56alpha but not S28A B56alpha were sensitized to etoposide. These results suggest that PKR regulates B56alpha-mediated PP2A signaling in REH cells.","['Section of Signal Transduction and Apoptosis, University of Minnesota Hormel Institute, Austin, Minnesota 55912, USA.']","['S0021-9258(20)58489-5 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M800951200 [doi]']",20081028,['CA30715/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2602900,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Protein levels of these core factors are tightly controlled by autoregulatory and feed-forward transcriptional mechanisms in order to prevent early differentiation. Recent studies have shown that knockdown of Esrrb (estrogen-related-receptor beta), a member of the nuclear orphan receptor family, induces differentiation of mouse ES cells cultured in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor. It was however not known how knocking down Esrrb exerts this effect. Herein we have identified two ESRRB binding sites in the proximal 5'-untranslated region of the mouse Oct4 gene, one of which is in close proximity to a NANOG binding site. Both ESRRB and NANOG are necessary for maintaining the activity of this promoter in ES cell lines. We have also demonstrated that the two transcription factors interact through their DNA binding domains. This interaction reciprocally modulates their transcriptional activities and may be important to fine-tune ES cell pluripotency. Supporting all of these data, stable transfection of Esrrb in ES cell lines proved sufficient to sustain their characteristics in the absence of leukemia-inhibitory factor. In summary, our experiments help to understand how Esrrb coordinates with Nanog and Oct4 to activate the internal machinery of ES cells.","['Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Group, Laboratory of Regenerative Biology, South China Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Guangzhou 510663, China.']","['S0021-9258(20)58527-X [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M803481200 [doi]']",20081028,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Typically, CML represents 15-20% of all adult leukemias, with 4830 new cases expected in 2008. The cytogenetic hallmark of CML is the Philadelphia chromosome, which is the result of the reciprocal translocation and conjugation of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene, BCR, on chromosome 22 and the Abelson (ABL) kinase gene, ABL, on chromosome 9. Current treatment is aimed at inhibiting BCR and ABL kinase with novel agents, the first being imatinib in 2003, and more recently dasatinib in 2006. Nilotinib is a new small-molecule inhibitor of tyrosine kinase rationally developed from the crystalline structure of the imatinib-ABL complex. It represents an aminopyrimidine derivative of imatinib with approximately 30 times more potency in vitro against imatinib-sensitive BCR-ABL-expressing cell lines and activity against 32 of 33 point mutations conferring resistance to imatinib. Data from phase I and II studies show that nilotinib has activity against all phases of CML in patients who are intolerant or have failed therapy with imatinib or dasatinib. Nilotinib represents a new therapeutic option for patients with CML who are intolerant or have failed therapy with imatinib. Ongoing clinical trials are assessing nilotinib's role in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed CML and its long-term efficacy and safety.","['Department of Pharmacy, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Elm and Carlton Streets, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.

It exerts its effects by binding to the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, a heterodimer of two transmembrane proteins, the specific leukemia inhibitory factor receptor subunit, and the common gp130. A partial cDNA clone coding for the membrane-bound form of the specific rabbit leukemia inhibitory factor receptor was isolated from the genital ridge of 13.5 days postcoitum fetus. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the rabbit leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene is located on chromosome OCU11p11.1. It has been shown that the membrane-bound rabbit leukemia inhibitory factor receptor mRNA is expressed during embryo implantation but not at earlier developmental stages. Rabbit embryonic stem cell-like line establishment is improved in the presence of LIF, and those cells express both leukemia inhibitory factor and its receptor. The withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor results the differentiation of embryonic stem cell-like cells to beating myocardial-like cells. Our findings suggest that the self-renewal mechanism is similar in mouse and rabbit embryonic stem cells, and expands our knowledge on the role of the LIF-LIFR signal pathway in early rabbit embryogenesis and rabbit embryonic stem cell establishment.","['Agricultural Biotechnology Center, 2100, Szent-Gyorgyi A. st.4, Godollo, Hungary.']",['10.1089/clo.2008.0023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) and the D835 activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the genomic DNA of Korean patients with AML at diagnosis and during follow-up. There were 226 patients with AML enrolled between March 1996 and August 2005. The incidence of ITD and TKD at diagnosis was 13% (29/226) and 3% (6/226). When compared to Western and other Asian patients with AML, Korean patients had a lower frequency by about two-thirds of ITD and TKD. Among the non-M3 cases (N=203), the patients with an ITD had a significantly shorter event-free survival when compared with those without an ITD (p=0.0079). Among 54 relapsed patients, 9 patients had the FLT3 ITD at diagnosis. Six patients demonstrated a reappearance of the ITD and 3 patients remained negative at relapse. One patient, among 45 patients who relapsed, had a negative baseline ITD but acquired a de novo ITD at relapse. There were 101 samples from 93 patients in remission; they were all negative for an ITD. Among 34 patients who failed to achieve a remission, five patients had a persistent ITD and one patient had a de novo ITD. These results support the concept of resistance of FLT3 ITD leukemic clones to chemotherapy. Therefore, effective therapy with FLT3 targeting agents may improve the prognosis of non-M3 AML patients with the FLT3 mutation.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea.']","['200810833 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2008.23.5.833 [doi]']",,,PMC2580007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A construct containing exon I.8 and its 5'-flanking sequence was sufficient to drive transcription in THP-1 cells. This novel promoter was located approximately 2-kb upstream of promoter I.4 and approximately 75-kb upstream of the common splice junction. We detected several I.8-containing splice variants, 2 of which also contained a sequence from exon I.4. Analysis of human tissues revealed a unique pattern of promoter I.8 usage.

We previously reported that bone marrow-derived stromal cells inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we demonstrate that the CXCR4 inhibitor AMD3465 antagonized stromal-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha)-induced and stroma-induced chemotaxis and inhibited SDF-1alpha-induced activation of prosurvival signaling pathways in leukemic cells. Further, CXCR4 inhibition partially abrogated the protective effects of stromal cells on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Fetal liver tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene mutations activate CXCR4 signaling, and coculture with stromal cells significantly diminished antileukemia effects of FLT3 inhibitors in cells with mutated FLT3. Notably, CXCR4 inhibition increased the sensitivity of FLT3-mutated leukemic cells to the apoptogenic effects of the FLT3 inhibitor sorafenib. In vivo studies demonstrated that AMD3465, alone or in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, induced mobilization of AML cells and progenitor cells into circulation and enhanced antileukemic effects of chemotherapy and sorafenib, resulting in markedly reduced leukemia burden and prolonged survival of the animals. These findings indicate that SDF-1alpha/CXCR4 interactions contribute to the resistance of leukemic cells to signal transduction inhibitor- and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in systems mimicking the physiologic microenvironment. Disruption of these interactions with CXCR4 inhibitors represents a novel strategy of sensitizing leukemic cells by targeting their protective bone marrow microenvironment.","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Some oncologists have argued that BMT should be offered to most patients in first complete remission (CR). Others have maintained that transplantation in first remission should be reserved for patients with high-risk disease. We performed this study to determine how disease risk influences the efficacy of BMT. METHODS: We combined data from four cooperative group clinical trials: Pediatric Oncology Group 8821, Children's Cancer Group (CCG) 2891, CCG 2961, and Medical Research Council 10. Using cytogenetics and the percentage of marrow blasts after the first course of chemotherapy, patients were stratified into favorable, intermediate, and poor-risk disease groups. Patients who could not be risk classified were analyzed separately. Outcomes for patients assigned to BMT and for patients assigned to chemotherapy alone were compared. RESULTS: The data set included 1,373 pediatric patients with AML in first CR. In the intermediate-risk group, the estimated disease-free survival at 8 years for patients who did not undergo transplantation was 39% +/- 5% (2 SE), whereas it was 58% +/- 7% for BMT patients. The estimated overall survival for patients who did not undergo transplantation was 51% +/- 5%, whereas it was 62% +/- 7% for BMT patients. Both differences were significant (P < .01).

These recommendations are meant to promote identifiable standards for specimen collection and handling within and across breast cancer trials, such that the variability in collection/handling practices that currently exists is minimized and specimen condition and quality are enhanced, thereby maximizing results from specimen-based diagnostic testing and research. Three working groups were formed from the Cooperative Group Banking Committee, BIG groups, and North American breast cancer cooperative groups to identify standards for collection and handling of (1) formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue; (2) blood and its components; and (3) fresh/frozen tissue from breast cancer trials. The working groups collected standard operating procedures from multiple group specimen banks, administered a survey on banking practices to those banks, and engaged in a series of discussions from 2005 to 2007. Their contributions were synthesized into this document, which focuses primarily on collection and handling of specimens to the point of shipment to the central bank, although also offers some guidance to central banks. Major recommendations include submission of an FFPE block, whole blood, and serial serum or plasma from breast cancer clinical trials, and use of one fixative and buffer type (10% neutral phosphate-buffered formalin, pH 7) for FFPE tissue across trials. Recommendations for proper handling and shipping were developed for blood, serum, plasma, FFPE, and fresh/frozen tissue.","['Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. leyland@emory.edu']","['JCO.2007.15.1712 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2007.15.1712 [doi]']",20081027,,PMC2651095,,,,,"['Breast International Group', 'Cooperative Groups of the Breast Cancer Intergroup of North America (TBCI)', 'American College of Surgeons Oncology Group', 'Cancer and Leukemia Group B', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group', 'Southwest Oncology Group', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Radiation Oncology Group', 'Gynecologic Oncology Group', ""Children's Oncology Group""]",,,,"['Piccart-Gebhart M', 'Wood WC', 'Norton L', 'Schmitt M', 'Kamin L']","['Piccart-Gebhart, Martine', 'Wood, William C', 'Norton, Larry', 'Schmitt, Manfred', 'Kamin, Leah']",,,,,,,,,

Although such a diet potentially entails inconvenience, its value is uncertain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-three patients admitted to a high-efficiency particulate air-filtered room (protected environment [PE]) to receive induction therapy for newly diagnosed AML were randomly assigned to a diet containing no raw fruits or vegetables (cooked diet) or to a diet containing fresh fruit and fresh vegetables (raw diet). Stratification was based on the patients' early risk of mortality (ERM) score. All patients received antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis and remained on study until they were discharged from the PE. The outcomes of principal interest were major infection (pneumonia, bacteremia, or fungemia) and death; if the true probability of either event was 20% on the cooked arm and 40% on the raw arm, then the probability that the cooked arm would be selected as superior was 83%. RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients were randomly assigned to the cooked arm, and 75 were assigned to the raw arm. The two groups were similar with respect to age, ERM, chemotherapy received, and days at risk. Twenty-nine percent of patients in the cooked group and 35% of patients in the raw group developed a major infection (P = .60). Time to major infection and survival time were similar in the two groups. Fever of unknown origin occurred in 51% of the cooked group and 36% of the raw group. CONCLUSION: In patients treated in a PE, a neutropenic diet did not prevent major infection or death.","['University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']","['JCO.2008.16.4681 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2008.16.4681 [doi]']",20081027,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC4879706,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In previous studies, GIST genotype correlated with treatment outcome and optimal imatinib dosing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the relationship between kinase genotype and treatment outcome for 428 patients enrolled on the North American phase III study SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 and treated with either 400 mg or 800 mg daily doses of imatinib. RESULTS: The presence of KIT exon 11-mutant genotype (n = 283) correlated with improved treatment outcome when compared with KIT exon 9-mutant (n = 32) and wild-type (WT; n = 67) genotypes for objective response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR], 71.7% v 44.4% [P = .007]; and 44.6% [P = .0002], respectively); time to tumor progression (TTP; median 24.7 months v 16.7 and 12.8 months, respectively); and overall survival (OS; median 60.0 months v 38.4 and 49.0 months, respectively). The survival outcomes for patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or WT GIST were not affected by imatinib dose. However, there was evidence of improved response rates for patients with exon 9-mutant tumors treated with imatinib 800 mg versus 400 mg (CR/PR, 67% v 17%; P = .02). Patients who had CD117-negative GIST had similar TTP but inferior OS compared with patients who had CD117-positive disease, which suggests that patients who have CD117-negative GIST may benefit from imatinib treatment. In addition, we identified novel but rare mutations of the KIT extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the favorable impact of KIT exon 11 genotype when compared with KIT exon 9 and wild-type genotype for patients with advanced GIST who are treated with imatinib.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine and Cell and Developmental Biology, Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute, Portland, OR 97239, USA.

OCDLs may consist of single strand breaks (SSBs), oxidized purines/pyrimidines and abasic sites within 5-10bp. These significant biological lesions are hypothesized to challenge the repair machinery and carry a high mutagenic potential. MSH2, a classical DNA mismatch repair protein, has been also implicated in other repair pathways associated with DSB and base lesion processing. MSH2 mutations have been identified in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients as well as in other types of cancers. Our research model involves two precursors B (pre-B) ALL human cell lines, NALM-6 cells, homozygous null for MSH2, and wild type 697 cells. Using a modified version of neutral and alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) with Escherichia coli repair enzymes as damage probes, the processing capacity of single strand breaks (SSBs), DSBs and OCDLs was assessed in NALM-6 and 697 cells exposed to a radiotherapy relevant gamma-ray dose of 5Gy. Using reverse transcriptase PCR and Western blotting we verified the complete lack of expression of MSH2 in the NALM-6 cells at the transcriptional and translational level. No differences were measured between NALM-6 and 697 cells in the induction levels of SSBs, DSBs and OCDLs after exposure to gamma-rays. However, 697 cells repaired each lesion more efficiently with significant differences observed after 1-3h post-irradiation. Lastly, our results indicate a significantly higher population of apoptotic 697 cells compared to NALM-6 cells 6-24h post-irradiation. Our studies suggest that MSH2 is probably involved in the processing of the biologically significant clustered DNA damages as well as the execution of apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation.","['Department of Biology, Thomas Harriot College of Arts and Sciences, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27858, USA.']","['S1383-5718(08)00275-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.mrgentox.2008.09.014 [doi]']",20081007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical utility has yet to be determined for breast cancer, where an emerging group at high risk of brain metastasis has fuelled consideration of PCI. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In reviewing our experience with PCI as part of a complex protocol for advanced breast cancer, we present descriptive data on late central nervous system outcomes in those receiving PCI. After high-dose anthracycline-based induction chemotherapy, Stage IIIB/IV breast cancer responders underwent tandem autologous marrow transplantation. Those in continued remission were referred for PCI. Whole-brain radiotherapy was delivered by usual means, at 36 Gy in 20 fractions. RESULTS: Twenty-four women, with median age 45 (28-61), were enrolled between 1995 and 1998. Disease was largely metastatic (79%), and 75% were previously exposed to chemotherapy or hormonotherapy. Ten patients received PCI, at a median of 13.4 (11.8-16.5) months from study entry. Six patients developed brain metastases, 2 despite PCI. Striking functional decline was documented in 3 patients (at 9 months, 4 years, and 5 years post-PCI), including one previously high-functioning woman requiring full care for posttreatment dementia. CONCLUSIONS: We present a series of advanced breast cancer patients treated prophylactically with whole-brain radiotherapy following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen. Although the therapeutic benefit of PCI is not ascertainable here, we describe brain metastases occurring despite PCI and serious long-term neurobehavioral sequelae in PCI-treated patients. Any further investigation of PCI in high-risk breast cancer will need to be approached with caution.","['Division of Radiation Oncology, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']","['S0360-3016(08)00931-0 [pii]', '10.1016/j.ijrobp.2008.05.031 [doi]']",20081026,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent findings show that retinal lymphomas are high-grade (i.e. aggressive), B-cell malignancies and are associated with a poor prognosis, with most patients dying of central nervous system disease. Immunophenotyping and somatic mutation analyses indicate that these lymphomas are probably derived from early post-germinal centre cells. Primary choroidal lymphomas are typically low-grade (i.e. indolent), B-cell tumours with morphological, immunophenotypical and genotypic features similar to extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (EMZL) elsewhere in the body. The putative cell of origin is the post-germinal centre (memory) B cell. Primary iridal lymphomas are very rare, with an equal distribution of B- and T-cell types and with a variable clinical course, most patients succumbing to their disease as a result of systemic dissemination. Primary lymphomas limited to the ciliary body are exceptionally rare. Secondary uveal lymphomas/leukaemias occur in patients with advanced systemic lymphoma or leukaemia, respectively. In summary, the term 'primary intraocular lymphoma (PIOL)' is imprecise. It would be preferable to refer to the various forms of intraocular lymphoma according to whether they are retinal, choroidal, ciliary or iridal and whether they are primary or secondary in these locations.","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Pathology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK. s.e.coupland@liverpool.ac.uk']","['CEO1843 [pii]', '10.1111/j.1442-9071.2008.01843.x [doi]']",,,,,,96,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds show significantly reduced toxicity and possibly increased bioavailability compared to free nitrogen mustards and therefore constitute potent antileukemic drugs. Both the CoMFA and CoMSIA studies gave similar results indicating that the steric effect and the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance especially in the steroidal part of the molecules probably determined their bioactivity. Of paramount interest is the observation that the orientation of the alkylating part of the SMEs toward the surface of ring B of the steroidal skeleton was related with increased activity. Concerning the steroidal part, the presence of hydrophobic groups in rings B and D was found to be important for enhanced activity. Enhancement of antileukemic potency is further observed if hydrophilic/H-bond acceptor groups are present at the positions 7 and 17 of the steroidal skeleton. Leapfrog simulations provided novel compounds which lead our future synthetic endeavor for obtaining SMEs with optimum bioactivity.","['Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, 26500 Rio, Patras, Greece.']",['10.1021/ci800240m [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of HGF mRNA was quantified absolutely using real-time fluorescence quantification PCR (FQ-PCR). RESULTS: Expressions of HGF mRNA in a group of AL were higher significantly than these in a control group (6.936 +/- 1.613, 0.407 +/- 0.170, P < 0.001), but there was similarity between a group of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and group of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (7.127 +/- 1.911, 6.635 +/- 0.934, P > 0.05). In AL subtypes, the expression of M5 (9.998 +/- 1.454) was higher than that of M2, M3, M4, L1, L2 and L3 (P < 0.001), but there were no differences among the latters (P > 0.05). Meanwhile, there was no statistical significance on the expressions of HGF mRNA between different age and sex (P > 0.05). In addition, expressions of HGF mRNA in the remission group were lower than these in the non-remission group (6.393 +/- 1.165, 8.041 +/- 1.848, P < 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: There are statistical significances of the expressions of bone marrow MNCs HGF mRNA among the AL group and control group. As to AL subtypes, there are no statistically significant differences between AML and ALL as well as between different age and sex. Besides, lower HGF mRNA level is correlated with better curative effect. It is suggested that HGF mRNA is a suitable index for AL diagnosis and treatment.","['Faculty of Laboratory Medicine, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the clinical features including age, sex, abnormality of peripheral hemogram before treatment, therapeutic effect and follow-up and laboratory data such as morphology, immunology, cytogenetics and molecular biology (MICM). RESULTS: The median age of the APL patients was 33 years old and the ratio of male and female was 1.21:1. Before treatment, the median level of WBC was 4.3 x 10(9)/L and the detection rate of abnormal promyelocyte on blood film was 85.8%; with immunophenotypic detection, the expression levels of CD117, CD34, HLA-DR, CD7, CD14 and CD19 in APL were found to be lower and the expression levels of CD2, CD33 and MPO higher than those in other subtypes of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) (both P < 0.01). Specific abnormal chromosome t (15;17) was detected in 91.7% of the patients, of whom 75.9% had standard translocation of t (15;17), being the most common one and 15.8% of the patients had t (15;17) with additional abnormal chromosome. There was only 7.5% of the patients with normal karyotype. However, the presence of both simple translocation and complex translocation was seldom seen. With molecular biological detection, PML/RARalpha fusion gene positive rate was 99.6%. In a relatively long clinical follow-up, we found that the complete remission (CR) rate in APL patients was 84.7%, incidence of DIC was 13.4% and five-year survival rate was 30.7%. The median count of WBC in CR group was lower than that non-remission group (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences on expressions of CD34 and CD2 and changes of cytogenetics between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive evaluation of MICM could be of important significance in the diagnosis and prognosis judgment for APL patients. The CR rate in these patients with high WBC count was considerable low.","['Department of Hematology the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanism responsible for such melanoma-induced bone metastasis is still poorly understood. In the present study, the intracardiac inoculation of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-producing human melanoma-derived cells (SEKI) developed osteolytic bone destruction in male BALB/cA-nu/nu nude mice. To elucidate the role of LIF in melanoma-induced osteolysis, cells were prepared in which the expression of LIF was reduced using a siRNA technique from the parent SEKI cells. Osteoclastogenesis was induced in the co-culture of LIF and/or SEKI cells with osteoblastic stromal cells in vitro, whereas the LIF-reduced SEKI cells did not induce osteoclastogenesis. The intracardiac inoculation of LIF-reduced SEKI cells resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence and number of bone metastasis in comparison to those in the mice inoculated with the parent SEKI cells. The expression of LIF was found in seven of nine human melanoma-derived cell lines, suggesting that LIF expression is a universal event in melanoma. These findings suggest that a potential role for LIF in the melanoma-induced bone metastasis possibly through the stimulation of osteoclastogenesis. LIF might therefore be a potentially effective drug target in the treatment of bone metastasis in melanoma.","['Institute for Clinical Research, National Kyushu Cancer Center, Fukuoka 811-1395, Japan.']",['10.1007/s10585-008-9223-x [doi]'],20081025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the Japanese Society of Hematology (JSH) has discussed establishing a registry of hematologic disorders, in order to contribute to improving the quality of treatments and clinical outcomes in this field. As a first step, the Timely and Appropriate Registration System for GLIVEC Therapy (TARGET), a registration system for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with imatinib, was established in October 2003. We present the preliminary results of the first 4 years' experience with this system.

Activated Galphao interacts with PLZF and augments its function as a repressor of transcription and cell growth. G protein-coupled receptor-mediated Galphao activation also enhanced PLZF function. In this study, we determined that the GTPase domain of Galphao contributes to Galphao:PLZF interaction. We also showed that the Galphao GTPase domain is important in modulating the function of PLZF.

In this study, we analyzed the involvement of such mechanisms in the regulation of five sPLA(2) isozymes and the M-type receptor of sPLA(2) (sPLA(2)-R) in human leukemic Jurkat cells. These cells constitutively expressed sPLA(2)-IB, sPLA(2)-III, sPLA(2)-X, and sPLA(2)-R but not sPLA(2)-IIA and sPLA(2)-V. Transcription of sPLA(2)-IIA and sPLA(2)-V was, however, detected after exposure of cells to the DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC). Expression of sPLA(2)-IIA was further enhanced by additional exposure to interferon-gamma and blocked by inhibitors of specificity protein 1, nuclear factor kappaB, and Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-dependent pathways. Sequence analysis and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction of bisulfite-modified genomic DNA revealed two 5'-CpG sites (-111 and -82) in the sPLA(2)-IIA proximal promoter that were demethylated after 5-aza-dC treatment. These sites may be involved in the DNA binding of specificity protein 1 and other transcription factors. Similar findings after treatment of human U937 leukemia cells with 5-aza-dC indicate that this mechanism of PLA2G2A gene silencing is not restricted to Jurkat and DU-145 cells.

Blimp1/Prmt5 complex plays a critical role in the specification and maintenance of the early germ cell lineage. However, PGCs can be induced to dedifferentiate back to a pluripotent state as embryonic germ (EG) cells when exposed to exogenous signaling molecules, FGF-2, LIF and SCF. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we show that Trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, is a highly potent agent that can replace FGF-2 to induce dedifferentiation of PGCs into EG cells. A key early event during dedifferentiation of PGCs in response to FGF-2 or TSA is the down-regulation of Blimp1, which reverses and apparently relieves the cell fate restriction imposed by it. Notably, the targets of Blimp1, which include c-Myc and Klf-4, which represent two of the key factors known to promote reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent state, are up-regulated. We also found early activation of the LIF/Stat-3 signaling pathway with the translocation of Stat-3 into the nucleus. By contrast, while Prmt5 is retained in EG cells, it translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it probably has an independent role in regulating pluripotency. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that dedifferentiation of PGCs into EG cells may provide significant mechanistic insights on early events associated with reprogramming of committed cells to a pluripotent state.","['Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK Gurdon Institute of Cancer and Developmental Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. gd225@cam ac.uk']",['10.1371/journal.pone.0003531 [doi]'],20081027,"['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'G108/500/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United Kingdom']",PMC2567847,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this context, some cytokines of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) family have been involved in the inflammatory processes associated to obesity. In addition to IL-6, the IL-6 cytokine family includes IL-11, ciliary neurotrophic factor (cntf), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), cardiotrophin-like cytokine (CLC), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) y Oncostatin M (OsM). These proteins are also known as gp130 cytokines because all of them exert their action via the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) as a common transducer protein within their functional receptor complexes. However, their role in obesity and related disorders is controversial; thus, whereas some studies have described the involvement of gp130 cytokines in the development of obesity and its related cluster of pathophysiologic conditions like insulin-resistance, fatty liver and cardiovascular diseases, other trials have proposed the gp130 receptor ligands as therapeutic targets in the treatment of obesity and its related disorders. In fact, CNTF treatment has demonstrated to be effective in the reduction of body weight, by promoting the inhibition of food intake and the activation of the energy expenditure, together with an improvement of insulin sensitivity.

Conditional repression of NRAS(G12V) expression greatly reduced peripheral white blood cell (WBC) counts in leukemia recipient mice and induced apoptosis in the transplanted AML cells correlated with reduced Ras/Erk signaling. After marked decrease of AML blast cells, myeloproliferative disease (MPD)-like AML relapsed characterized by cells that did not express NRAS(G12V). In comparison with primary AML, the MPD-like AML showed significantly reduced aggressiveness, reduced myelosuppression, and a more differentiated phenotype. We conclude that, in AML induced by an Mll-AF9 transgene, NRAS(G12V) expression contributes to acute leukemia maintenance by suppressing apoptosis and reducing differentiation of leukemia cells.

Whether examined by intracellular esterase activity, phosphatidylserine externalization, DNA strand breaks, or caspase activation, we found that XN potentiated tumor necrosis factor-induced apoptosis in leukemia and myeloma cells. This enhancement of apoptosis correlated with down-regulation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) survivin, bcl-xL, XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2, cylin D1, and c-myc. XN down-regulated both constitutive and inducible NF-kappaB activation, inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaBalpha, suppression of p65 nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene transcription. XN directly inhibited tumor necrosis factor-induced IkappaBalpha kinase (IKK) activation and a reducing agent abolished this inhibition, indicating the role of cysteine residue. XN had no effect on the IKK activity when cysteine residue 179 of IKK was mutated to alanine. XN also directly inhibited binding of p65 to DNA, a reducing agent reversed this effect, and mutation of cysteine residue 38 to serine of p65 abolished this effect. Thus, our results show that modification of cysteine residues of IKK and p65 by XN leads to inhibition of the NF-kappaB activation pathway, suppression of antiapoptotic gene products, and potentiation of apoptosis in leukemia cells.","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

To investigate physiologic functions of Mll5, we have generated a knockout mouse mutant using Cre/loxP technology.

Although full-length AML1-ETO alone fails to promote leukemia because of its detrimental effects on cell proliferation, an alternatively spliced isoform, AML1-ETO9a, without its C-terminal NHR3/NHR4 domains, strongly induces leukemia. However, full-length AML1-ETO is a major form of fusion product in many t(8;21) AML patients, suggesting additional molecular mechanisms of t(8;21)-related leukemogenesis. Here, we report that disruption of the zinc-chelating structure in the NHR4 domain of AML1-ETO by replacing only one critical amino acid leads to rapid onset of leukemia, demonstrating that the NHR4 domain with the intact structure generates inhibitory effects on leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we identified SON, a DNA/RNA-binding domain containing protein, as a novel NHR4-interacting protein. Knock-down of SON by siRNA resulted in significant growth arrest, and disruption of the interaction between AML1-ETO and endogenous SON rescued cells from AML1-ETO-induced growth arrest, suggesting that SON is an indispensable factor for cell growth, and AML1-ETO binding to SON may trigger signals inhibiting leukemogenesis. In t(8;21) AML patient-derived primary leukemic cells and cell lines, abnormal cytoplasmic localization of SON was detected, which may keep cells proliferating in the presence of full-length AML1-ETO. These results uncovered the crucial role of the NHR4 domain in determination of cellular fate during AML1-ETO-associated leukemogenesis.","['Moores UCSD Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.']","['0802696105 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.0802696105 [doi]']",20081024,"['R01 CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA096735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA104509/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2579385,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes homologous to several virB genes and virD4 of Agrobacterium tumefaciens are found in an intravacuolar pathogen Ehrlichia chaffeensis, the tick-borne causative agent of human monocytic ehrlichiosis. In particular, despite its small genome size, E. chaffeensis has four tandem virB6 paralogs (virB6-1, -2, -3, and -4) that are 3- to 10-fold larger than A. tumefaciens virB6. The present study for the first time illustrates the relevance of the larger quadruple VirB6 paralogs by demonstrating the protein expression and interaction in E. chaffeensis. All four virB6 paralogs were cotranscribed in THP-1 human leukemia and ISE6 tick cell cultures. The four VirB6 proteins and VirB9 were expressed by E. chaffeensis in THP-1 cells, and amounts of these five proteins were similar in isolated E. chaffeensis-containing vacuoles and vacuole-free E. chaffeensis. In addition, an 80-kDa fragment of VirB6-2 was detected, which was strikingly more prevalent in E. chaffeensis-containing vacuoles than in vacuole-free E. chaffeensis. Coimmunoprecipitation analysis revealed VirB9 interaction with VirB6-1 and VirB6-2; VirB6-4 interaction with VirB6-1, VirB6-2, and VirB6-3; and VirB6-2 80-kDa fragment interaction with VirB6-3 and VirB6-4. The interaction of VirB9 and VirB6-2 was confirmed by far-Western blotting. The results suggest that E. chaffeensis VirB9, the quadruple VirB6 proteins, and the VirB6-2 80-kDa fragment form a unique molecular subassembly to cooperate in type IV secretion.","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, 1925 Coffey Road, Columbus, OH 43210-1093, USA.']","['JB.01031-08 [pii]', '10.1128/JB.01031-08 [doi]']",20081024,['R01 AI054476/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC2612412,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The past decade witnessed the general clinical use of monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab, both as single agents and in combination regimens with cytotoxic drugs, for previously untreated and relapsed CLL. First-line chemoimmunotherapy regimens combining rituximab and purine analogues have greatly improved initial response rates and progression-free survival. Despite these advances in first-line therapy, patients with CLL invariably experience relapse and often acquire high-risk chromosomal abnormalities, such as del(11q22) and del(17p13), which result in resistance to current therapies. Patients who are refractory to fludarabine-based therapy have a median survival of <1 year. Therefore, new agents with novel mechanisms of action are needed for the treatment of patients with relapsed CLL, particularly for patients with high-risk genetic features. Recent clinical studies have examined the tolerability and efficacy of several novel agents in relapsed CLL: (1) the alkylator bendamustine, (2) the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol, (3) the immunomodulating drug lenalidomide, (4) the bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide oblimersen, and (5) the Bcl-2 small-molecule inhibitor obatoclax. While these agents have demonstrated exciting clinical activity against genetically high-risk CLL, they have also induced toxicities that have not been commonly observed with previous CLL therapies. The most notable toxicities have been tumor lysis syndrome and tumor flare, which are potentially serious or even fatal complications of these new therapies. Thus, further studies are needed to define these agents' biologic mechanism(s) of action, clinical activity, and safety.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. thomas.lin@osumc.edu']","['S1557-9190(11)70273-6 [pii]', '10.3816/CLM.2008.s.009 [doi]']",,,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we show that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), in combination with a sub-toxic dose of SFN, significantly triggered apoptosis in TNF-alpha-resistant leukemia cells (THP-1, HL60, U937, and K562), which was associated with caspase activity and poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase cleavage. We also report that SFN non-specifically inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation through the inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation, IkappaBalpha degradation, and p65 nuclear translocation. This inhibition correlated with the suppression of NF-kappaB-dependent genes involved in anti-apoptosis (IAP-1, IAP-2, XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), cell proliferation (c-Myc, COX-2, and cyclin D1), and metastasis (VEGF and MMP-9). These effects suggest that SFN inhibits TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation through the suppression of IkappaBalpha degradation, leading to reduced expression of NF-kappaB-regulated gene products. Combined treatment with SFN and TNF-alpha was also accompanied by the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-treatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine significantly attenuated the combined treatment-induced ROS generation and caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, implying the involvement of ROS in this type of cell death. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that SFN suppresses TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activity and induces apoptosis through activation of ROS-dependent caspase-3.","['Department of Marine Life Science, Cheju National University, Jeju 690-756, Republic of Korea.']","['S0304-3835(08)00727-1 [pii]', '10.1016/j.canlet.2008.09.013 [doi]']",20081025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IPA-prophylactic strategies include administration of aerosolized amphotericin-B. Liposomal amphotericin-B (L-AmB) is one of the formulations available, although few data exist on safety and tolerability. METHODS: Data on tolerability, systemic toxicity and effects of aerosolized L-AmB on pulmonary function were recorded in a subgroup out of 271 haematological patients enrolled in a placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of aerosolized L-AmB for the prevention of IPA. Using an adaptive aerosol-delivery system, nebulization of L-AmB or placebo was performed during chemotherapy-induced neutropenia for 30 min/day on 2 consecutive days/week with a maximum of 6 weeks. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients (41 episodes) received L-AmB, 39 patients (49 episodes) received placebo. Proportions of patients with >20% post-nebulization decline in forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV(1)) or forced vital capacity (FVC) did not differ between groups. Also 26/38 L-AmB patients (68%) versus 31/39 patients (79%) on placebo had no significant decline during the entire treatment (p=0.20). Coughing was significantly more reported in L-AmB patients (p<0.0001). No differences were observed when baseline and post-nebulization serum levels of renal function and hepatic enzymes were compared. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term prophylactic nebulization of L-AmB was well tolerated and not associated with decline in pulmonary function or systemic adverse effects.","[""Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Infectious Diseases, Erasmus MC, 's Gravendijkwal 230, 3015 CE Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]","['S1094-5539(08)00090-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.pupt.2008.09.001 [doi]']",20081007,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The HTB lines were obtained from the same donor, so, could be considered a matched pair, that is, normal control versus cancer cells and thus, provide a model for testing specificity of action for the acylamido analogs. While many compounds were efficacious in inhibiting the proliferation of various cell lines, only two analogs showed a high degree of specificity in the matched HTB cell lines. N-palmitoyl dopamine and N-palmitoyl tyrosine each demonstrated complete specificity of action at a concentration of 10muM and were highly efficacious in both cases.

While there have been improvements in survival during the last decade for younger patients, prognosis in elderly patients is still poor; approximately 50% achieve complete responses, but many of them relapse. With increasing age, more patients are suboptimal candidates for standard induction chemotherapy due to poor performance status, pre-existing myelodysplasia, unfavorable cytogenetics, treatment-related AML, multidrug resistance protein expression, and CD34 positivity, which are often characteristic of this patient population. In addition, the presence of comorbid conditions make many treatment options less tolerable for elderly patients. Several investigators have described subgroups showing no benefit after intensive treatment approaches in recent years. However, several novel agents have been developed to treat elderly AML patients. These include new chemotherapeutic agents, such as nucleoside analogs, as well as targeted therapies like farnesyltransferase inhibitors, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, epigenetic drugs, and antibodies. On the other hand new insights into the biology of the disease lead to a better understanding of its heterogeneity.

The current study sought to determine CML-derived endotheliopoiesis in patients with CML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Endothelial cells were isolated from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of six newly diagnosed CML patients using an immunomagnetic approach. The resulting endothelial cells were immediately subjected to fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis to determine BCR-ABL-positive endothelial cells. RESULTS: The purity of isolated endothelial cells was 94.47% +/- 2.37%. In bone marrow, the BCR-ABL-positive endothelial cells accounted for 70.8% +/- 10.7% of total freshly isolated endothelial cells. In peripheral blood, however, the BCR-ABL-positive endothelial cells accounted for only 20.8% +/- 9.8% of isolated endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: The present data demonstrate a dominant contribution of CML-derived endothelial cells to endotheliopoiesis in newly diagnosed CML, and provide the rationale for targeting hemangioblasts and angiogenesis in management of CML.","['Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, P.R.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The suspension of Ba/F3 cells transduced with firefly luciferase and p190 BCR-ABL genes was exposed to ionizing radiation, and viable cell numbers and bioluminescent signals were measured serially. Mice intravenously inoculated with the cells underwent TBI at various doses. In vivo BLI was performed repeatedly until spontaneous death, and whole-body bioluminescence signals were determined as an indicator of whole-body tumor burden. RESULTS: In the cell culture study, bioluminescence signals generally reflected viable cell numbers, despite some overestimation immediately after irradiation. Sublethal TBI in mice transiently depressed the increase in whole-body signals and prolonged survival. Spontaneous death occurred at similar signal levels regardless of radiation dose. A significant negative correlation was found between survival and whole-body signal early after TBI. Significant dose dependence was demonstrated for both survival and signal increase early after TBI and was more evident for signal increase. Lethally irradiated mice without bone marrow transplantation died while showing weak signals. In mice receiving lethal TBI and syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, signal reduction and prolongation of survival were prominent, and whole-body signals at death were similar to those in nonirradiated or sublethally irradiated mice. CONCLUSION: In vivo BLI allows longitudinal, quantitative evaluation of the response to TBI in mice of a hematological malignancy model. Antitumor effects can be assessed early and reliably using in vivo BLI.","['Department of Radiology, Institute of Medical Science, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. inoueys-tky@umin.ac.jp']","['S0301-472X(08)00391-3 [pii]', '10.1016/j.exphem.2008.08.004 [doi]']",20081025,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 22 normal bone marrow samples which served as controls collectively expressed low levels of WT1 and PRAME. An increase of >1-log over the upper limit of normal bone marrow was defined as positive. The positive rates of WT1 and PRAME for all patients were 79.2% and 55.4%, respectively.

PRAME was positive in 9/25 WT1 (-) patients and the log increase of PRAME was higher than that of WT1 in 12/83 WT1 (+) patients.

However, there are only limited data on risk in the current era of serologic testing and human leukocytes antigen typing to screen for CD. There is also no information on the role of family history of CD in relation to lymphoma risk. METHODS: We identified 37,869 NHL, 8323 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 13,842 chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients diagnosed in Sweden between 1965 and 2004, as well as 236,408 matched controls and 613,961 first-degree relatives. Using logistic regression, we calculated odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as measures of risks adjusted for matching factors. RESULTS: Overall we found persons with a hospital discharge diagnosis of CD to have a 5.35-fold (95% CI, 3.56-8.06) increased NHL risk. Risk of HL was borderline increased (OR=2.54, 95% CI, 0.99-6.56); however, there was no excess chronic lymphocytic leukemia risk. Persons diagnosed with CD in 1975-1984, 1985-1994, and 1995-2004 had a 13.2-fold (95% CI, 3.63-48.0), 7.90-fold (95% CI, 3.38-18.5), and 3.84-fold (95% CI, 2.28-6.45) increased risk of NHL, respectively (P(trend)< .0001). Individuals with a sibling affected with CD had a 2.03-fold (95% CI, 1.29-3.19) increased NHL risk. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with CD have an increased NHL risk; however, the excess risk has tapered off substantially in the last 4 decades. The observed excess NHL risk among individuals with a sibling affected with CD suggests shared susceptibility.

As a consequence of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations, two of the MTG proteins, MTG8 and MTG16, are fused to the DNA-binding domain of AML1, a transcriptional activator crucial for hematopoiesis. The AML1-MTG fusion proteins, as the wild type MTGs, display four conserved homology regions (NHR1-4) related to the Drosophila nervy protein. Structural protein analyses led us to test the hypothesis that specific MTG domains may mediate RNA binding. RESULTS: By using an RNA-binding assay based on synthetic RNA homopolymers and a panel of MTG deletion mutants, here we show that all the MTG proteins can bind RNA. The RNA-binding properties can be traced to two regions: the Zinc finger domains in the NHR4, which mediate Zinc-dependent RNA binding, and a novel short basic region (SBR) upstream of the NHR2, which mediates Zinc-independent RNA binding. The two AML1-MTG fusion proteins, retaining both the Zinc fingers domains and the SBR, also display RNA-binding properties. CONCLUSION: Evidence has been accumulating that RNA plays a role in transcriptional control. Both wild type MTGs and chimeric AML1-MTG proteins display in vitro RNA-binding properties, thus opening new perspectives on the possible involvement of an RNA component in MTG-mediated chromatin regulation.","['Cancer Genetics Program, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA. stefano.rossetti@roswellpark.org']","['1471-2199-9-93 [pii]', '10.1186/1471-2199-9-93 [doi]']",20081024,"['P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2579434,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the feasibility of transfusing haplo-identical, T-cell depleted, KIR-ligand mismatched NK cells, after conditioning therapy with melphalan and fludarabine, to patients with advanced multiple myeloma (MM) followed by delayed rescue with autologous stem cells. No graft-versus-host disease or failure of autologous stem cells to engraft was observed. There was significant variation in the number of allo-reactive NK cells transfused. However, all NK products containing allo-reactive NK cells killed the NK cell target K562, the MM cell line U266, and recipient MM cells when available. Post NK cell infusion there was a rise in endogenous interleukin-15 accompanied by increasing donor chimaerism. Donor chimaerism was eventually lost, which correlated with the emergence of potent host anti-donor responses indicating that the immunosuppressive properties of the conditioning regimen require further optimization. Further, blocking of inhibitory KIR-ligands with anti-human leucocyte antigen antibody substantially enhanced killing of MM cells thus highlighting the potential for modulating NK/MM cell interaction. Encouragingly, 50% of patients achieved (near) complete remission.

Epub 2008 Oct 23.,,10.1055/s-0028-1086027 [doi],"BACKGROUND: With the increasing number of long-term survivors among patients diagnosed with cancer during childhood, questions concerning late effects have become a major research topic. To ascertain late effects, it is necessary to contact former patients. An essential requirement for such studies is a long-term surveillance (LTS) of former childhood cancer patients in their adolescence and their adulthood. The paper describes the role of the German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) in LTS. A cohort of long-term survivors has been built up over the years. The characteristics of this LTS cohort and strategies for further improvement of LTS will be presented. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1980 the GCCR systematically ascertains all malignant neoplasms and benign brain tumours in children under the age of 15 years at diagnosis. Participants are followed up actively by the treating hospitals and the clinical study groups in the first years after diagnosis, and by the GCCR thereafter. Late effects are accessed within the Scientific Society for Paediatric Oncology and Haematology (GPOH) of different groups with different focal points. Those groups are the GCCR (secondary malignant neoplasms), LESS (late effects after chemotherapy), RiSK (late effects after radiotherapy), and the working group on quality of life (quality of life and data on life circumstances). Additionally, the GCCR provides logistics for contacting patients during LTS. The LTS is supported by a recent basic publication (""position paper"") by the GPOH. Newly diseased cancer cases are reported to the GCCR very completely. The GCCR contains mainly epidemiological data. Accessorily, the GCCR ascertains a minimum of data for each patient which enables population-based studies involving long-term survivors of childhood cancer. RESULTS: Out of 37 291 children diagnosed with cancer between 1980 and 2004, 8 896 died (until spring 2007). From those not deceased, 21 987 (77.4%) can be followed up further (i.e. current address is known). For about 70% of the patients in the LTS cohort, follow-up data are available and not older than 5 years. Our experience shows that about 80% of former childhood cancer patients agree to continued data storage at the GCCR, 4% explicitly refuse their consent, the remaining do not answer. LTS for patients with leukemia and lymphomas is particularly complete, whereas for patients with brain tumours it is less complete. CONCLUSIONS: The LTS is considered highly relevant concerning aspects of clinical quality assurance and epidemiological research. The GCCR can guarantee a continuing development and improvement of existing procedures for LTS. The GCCR expects to achieve contacting a high percentage of former childhood cancer patients also in future LTS, even after long periods of time.","['German Childhood Cancer Registry (GCCR) at the Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), University of Mainz, Germany. debling@imbei.uni-mainz.de']",['10.1055/s-0028-1086027 [doi]'],20081023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to impaired treatment response these patients are prone to suffer relapse and are thus by definition stratified into the clinically defined high risk group receiving intensified chemotherapy. Besides response to chemotherapy long term prognosis is also influenced by immunological control mechanisms. Thus, high expression of the TNF receptor CD40 has been shown to prevent particularly late relapse in BCP-ALL suggesting a pivotal role of this regulatory molecule for maintenance of the remission status. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We therefore determined the baseline expression and CD40-mediated modulation of TNF receptor and costimulatory molecules in 5 patients with proB-ALL, 8 with preB-ALL and 22 with c-ALL performing FACS analysis. We particularly compared the TNF receptor status on proB-ALL blasts to the expression on more mature preB- and c-ALL blasts. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate for the first time a significantly lower baseline expression and CD40-induced modulation capacity of TNF receptor and costimulatory molecules in pediatric proB-ALL compared to more mature precursor B-ALL blasts. CONCLUSION: The lower expression and defective capacity of proB-ALL blasts to respond to CD40 ligand stimulation might resemble the immature feature of these blasts and besides increased chemoresistance contribute to the impaired prognosis of these patients due to escape from apoptosis and immunological control mechanisms.","['Clinic for Pediatric-Oncology, -Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Heinrich Heine University Dusseldorf, Germany. troeger@med.uni-duesseldorf.de']",['10.1055/s-0028-1086028 [doi]'],20081023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As2O3 induces apoptosis in APL cells through mechanisms dependent and independent of the PML-RARalpha fusion protein. Through PML-RARalpha fusion-independent mechanisms, As2O3 increases H2O2 production via its effects on glutathione and glutathione peroxidase. Catalase is an alternative mechanism to convert H2O2 to water. Therefore, we explored the relationship between catalase activity and As2O3 sensitivity. In AML and APL cell lines, but not primary patient samples, basal catalase levels matched sensitivity to As2O3. However, the chemical inhibition of catalase did not enhance As2O3-induced cell death. Failure of catalase inhibition to sensitise cells to As2O3 was due to a failure of catalase inhibition to increased levels of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, other strategies should be explored to enhance the cytotoxicity of As2O3 in AML.","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Hospital, and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']","['904755694 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802353617 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Medical records of 50 patients with acute leukemia who were treated for septic shock in the Medical ICU of Samsung Medical Centre between September 2001 and June 2006 were retrospectively reviewed. The data were analysed for patient outcomes and for predictors of ICU mortality. ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality were 60% and 68%, respectively. The need for mechanical ventilation (p<0.001), the addition of norepinephrine to dopamine (p<0.001) and a poor Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (p<0.001) were associated with ICU mortality in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis using the Cox-model, a relapsed/refractory status for leukemia and poor SOFA score were independent predictors for ICU mortality. In conclusion, although the mortality was high in patients with acute leukemia who were admitted to the ICU for septic shock management, it was not high enough to preclude intensive care. Patients with severe organ failure and a relapse/refractory status for leukemia had a significantly worse prognosis.","['Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Korea.']","['904755538 [pii]', '10.1080/10428190802353609 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compound 1 potently inhibits the activity of purified 20S and 26S proteasome in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and leukemia Jurkat T cells. Inhibition of tumor cellular proteasomal activity by Compound 1 results in the accumulation of ubiquitinated protein and the proteasome target proteins p27 and Bax, followed by the induction of apoptosis.

C6-ceramide induces cleavage of Caspase-8 and Caspase-9, but only Caspase-8 is required for apoptosis. The sphingolipid killed CML derived KBM5 cells and, to a lesser extent, imatinib-resistant KBM5-STI cells suggesting that BCR-ABL can not completely block C6-ceramide-induced apoptosis but the kinase may regulate the process. BCR-ABL is known to suppress Protein Phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in CML cells. While C6-ceramide can activate PP2A in acute leukemia cells, the sphingolipid did not activate the phosphatase in K562 cells. C6-ceramide did not activate p38 kinase but did promote JNK activation and phosphorylation of JUN. Inhibition of JNK by pharmacological agent protected K562 cells from C6-ceramide suggesting that JNK plays an essential role in C6-ceramide mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, the sphingolipid promoted MCL-1 phosphorylation by a mechanism that, at least in part, involves JNK.

MA9 is commonly found in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and occasionally in acute lymphoid leukemia and is associated with intermediate to poor outcome. The specific signaling pathways downstream of MA9 are still poorly understood. We have recently described a model system whereby we expressed the MA9 fusion gene in human CD34(+) Umbilical Cord Blood (UCB) cells and showed that these cells transformed to acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia when injected into immunodeficient mice. The Mixed Lineage Leukemia (MLL) oncogenes are unique in this model system in that they promote full transformation of primary human blood cells, while all other leukemia-associated oncogenes tested thus far have induced only partial phenotypes. Here we provide an update on the use of this system for modeling human leukemia and its potential application for therapeutic testing of novel compounds to treat the disease.

Here we investigate the biologic significance of Hsp90 inhibition in multiple myeloma (MM) and other hematologic tumors using an orally available novel small molecule inhibitor SNX-2112, which exhibits unique activities relative to 17-allyamino-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin (17-AAG). SNX-2112 triggers growth inhibition and is more potent than 17-AAG against MM and other malignancies. It induces apoptosis via caspase-8, -9, -3, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. SNX-2112 inhibits cytokine-induced Akt and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation and also overcomes the growth advantages conferred by interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-1, and bone marrow stromal cells. Importantly, SNX-2112 inhibits tube formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells via abrogation of eNOS/Akt pathway and markedly inhibits osteoclast formation via down-regulation of ERK/c-fos and PU.1. Finally, SNX-2112, delivered by its prodrug SNX-5422, inhibits MM cell growth and prolongs survival in a xenograft murine model. Our results indicate that blockade of Hsp90 by SNX-2112 not only inhibits MM cell growth but also acts in the bone marrow microenvironment to block angiogenesis and osteoclastogenesis. Taken together, our data provide the framework for clinical studies of SNX-2112 to improve patient outcome in MM and other hematologic malignancies.","['LeBow Institute for Myeloma Therapeutics and Jerome Lipper Myeloma Center, Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA. yutaka_okawa@dfci.harvard.edu']","['S0006-4971(20)37814-9 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-151928 [doi]']",20081023,"['R0-1 CA50947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'IP50 CA10070-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA050947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0-1 CA78378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2630270,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, evidence suggests that Nf1 loss alone does not cause leukemia. We therefore hypothesized that inactivation of the Nf1 tumor suppressor gene requires cooperating mutations to cause acute leukemia. To search for candidate genes that cooperate with Nf1 deficiency in leukemogenesis, we performed a forward genetic screen using retroviral insertion mutagenesis in Nf1 mutant mice. We identified 43 common proviral insertion sites that contain candidate genes involved in leukemogenesis. One of these genes, Bcl11a, confers a growth advantage in cultured Nf1 mutant hematopoietic cells and causes early onset of leukemia of either myeloid or lymphoid lineage in mice when expressed in Nf1-deficient bone marrow. Bcl11a-expressing cells display compromised p21(Cip1) induction, suggesting that Bcl11a's oncogenic effects are mediated, in part, through suppression of p21(Cip1). Importantly, Bcl11a is expressed in human chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia samples. A subset of AML patients, who had poor outcomes, of 16 clusters, displayed high levels of BCL11A in leukemic cells. These findings suggest that deregulated Bcl11a cooperates with Nf1 in leukemogenesis, and a therapeutic strategy targeting the BCL11A pathway may prove beneficial in the treatment of leukemia.","['Masonic Cancer Center and Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)37782-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-03-144436 [doi]']",20081023,"['U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2635073,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of depsipeptide alone and in combination with daclizumab (humanized anti-Tac) in a murine model of human ATL. The Met-1 ATL model was established by intraperitoneal injection of ex vivo leukemic cells into nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Either depsipeptide, given at 0.5 mg/kg every other day for 2 weeks, or daclizumab, given at 100 microg weekly for 4 weeks, inhibited tumor growth as monitored by serum levels of soluble IL-2R-alpha (sIL-2R-alpha) and soluble beta2-microglobulin (beta2mu) (P < .001), and prolonged survival of the leukemia-bearing mice (P < .001) compared with the control group. Combination of depsipeptide with daclizumab enhanced the antitumor effect, as shown by both sIL-2R-alpha and beta2mu levels and survival of the leukemia-bearing mice, compared with those in the depsipeptide or daclizumab alone groups (P < .001).

Important differences regarding mutational load and targeting were identified in groups of sequences defined by IGKV/IGLV gene usage and/or K/LCDR3 features. Recurrent amino acid (AA) changes in the IGKV/IGLV sequences were observed in subsets of CLL cases with stereotyped B-cell receptors (BCRs), especially those expressing IGHV3-21/IGLV3-21 and IGHV4-34/IGKV2-30 BCRs. Comparison with CLL LC sequences carrying heterogeneous K/LCDR3s or non-CLL LC sequences revealed that distinct amino acid changes appear to be ""CLL-biased."" Finally, a significant proportion of CLL cases with monotypic LC expression were found to carry multiple potentially functional LC rearrangements, alluding to active, (auto)antigen-driven receptor editing. In conclusion, SHM targeting in CLL LCs is just as precise and, likely, functionally driven as in heavy chains. Secondary LC gene rearrangements and subset-biased mutations in CLL LC genes are strong indications that LCs are crucial in shaping the specificity of leukemic BCRs, in association with defined heavy chains. Therefore, CLL is characterized not only by stereotyped HCDR3 and heavy chains but, rather, by stereotyped BCRs involving both chains, which generate distinctive antigen-binding grooves.","['Institute of Agrobiotechnology, Centre for Research and Technology, Thessaloniki, Greece.']","['S0006-4971(20)37889-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-166868 [doi]']",20081023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These in turn may lead to the activation of oncogenes, inactivation of tumor suppressor genes or formation of chimeric oncoproteins. Epigenetics, in contrast, refers to a number of biochemical modifications of chromatin, either to DNA directly or to its associated protein complexes that affect gene expression without altering the primary sequence of DNA [Robertson KD, Wolffe AP. DNA methylation in health and disease. Nat Rev Genet 2000;1:11-9; Jones PA, Baylin SB. The epigenomics of cancer. Cell. 2007;128:683-92]. A fundamental difference between genetic and epigenetic alterations is the irreversible nature of genetic lesions whereas epigenetic ones are potentially reversible, allowing for therapeutic intervention. In the last decade, it has become apparent that epigenetic changes play an important role in cancer, particularly in leukemia. Significant advances have been made in the elucidation of these processes as well as in translating this knowledge to the clinic, as in the development of new prognostic biomarkers or targeted therapies.

Theoretical considerations predict that whole-culture methods of synchronization cannot synchronize cells. Upon serum starvation, the fraction of cells with a G1-phase amount of DNA increased, but the cell-size distribution is not narrowed. In true synchronization, the cell-size distribution should be narrower than the cell-size distribution of the original culture. In contrast, cells produced by a selective (i.e. non-whole-culture) method have a specific DNA content, a narrow size distribution, and divide synchronously. The general theory leading to the conclusion that whole-culture methods for synchronization do not work implies that one can generalize these serum-starvation results to other cell lines and other whole-culture methods, to conclude that these methods do not synchronize cells.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0620, USA. cooper@umich.edu']","['S1065-6995(08)00573-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellbi.2008.09.009 [doi]']",20081007,['5 P30 CA46592/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It protects by delaying the loss of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L); however, the mechanism of regulation is unknown. Utilizing hyperoxia as a model of chronic oxidative stress and DNA damage, p21 was detected in the nucleus and cytoplasm and cytoplasmic expression of p21 was sufficient for cytoprotection. p21 was enriched in a subcellular fraction containing mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), suggesting that it may be coordinating ER and mitochondrial stress pathways. Consistent with this, p21 suppressed hyperoxic downregulation of BiP and subsequent activation of ER stress signaling, which affected Mcl-1, but not Bcl-X(L); though both inhibited hyperoxic cell death. Taken together, these data show that p21 integrates the DNA damage response with ER stress signaling, which then regulates mitochondrial death pathways during chronic genotoxic stress.","['Department of Environmental Medicine, The University of Rochester, NY 14642, USA.']","['S0891-5849(08)00541-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2008.09.022 [doi]']",20081007,"['R01 HL067392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-01247/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 ES007026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 ES001247-349022/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES-07026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-67392/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL066988-08/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007026-21/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-66988/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 ES007026/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL066988/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL067392-06/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2631574,['NIHMS88717'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression in bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) was measured by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively in 4 children with ALL relapse, 15 children with ALL in complete remission (CR) and 40 children with newly diagnosed ALL. Ten normal bone marrow samples were used as controls. Jurkat cells were treated with different concentrations of adriamycin (ADM). The cell proliferation was detected with MTT. The apoptosis rate was measured by flow cytometry. WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression of Jurkat cells treated with ADM was detected by RT-PCR and Western blotting respectively. RESULTS: WAVE1 was not expressed or weakly expressed in BMMCs from normal controls and patients with ALL in CR. Higher WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression was found in BMMCs from patients with newly diagnosed ALL and patients with relapse ALL when compared with the controls and the patients in CR (P<0.01). ADM significantly inhibited the proliferation of the Jurkat cells and the inhibitory effect was dose-and time-dependent (P<0.05). After ADM treatment for 24 hrs, the percentage of apoptosis cells increased significantly and WAVE1 mRNA and protein expression of Jurkat cells decreased significantly when compared with the untreated controls (P<0.05).

The breakpoints, defined at the sequence level, mapped within HPS5 (Hermansky Pudlak syndrome 5) intron 1 at 11p15.1, and DA926692 exon 2 at 2q11.2. The translocation was accompanied by a submicroscopic inversion that brought the two genes into the same transcriptional orientation. No chimeric trancript was detected.

Usually, GS occurs concomitantly with or after acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), myeloproliferative disorder, or myelodysplastic syndrome. In rare cases, it occurs as a ""preleukemic"" condition and may precede the onset of AML, which occurs within several months if the patient is not treated with AML-type systemic chemotherapy. Recently, we discovered one case of nonleukemic GS in the small intestine incidentally when intussusception was suspected. The patient visited the emergency department, in October 2006, with symptoms of small-bowel obstruction. Intussusception due to a small-intestinal mass was suspected after evaluation, and small-intestine segmental resection was performed. The patient had no previous history of leukemia, and immunohistochemical staining was used to diagnose GS. Bone-marrow biopsy performed subsequently revealed no lesions that could be suspected as leukemia. The patient received three cycles of chemotherapy, applied as for AML (cytosine arabinoside and anthracycline), and is currently, as of October 29, 2007, showing no other marked indisposition; he has been disease-free for 12 months.","['Department of Surgery, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, 1 Hoegi-dong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul 130-702, Korea.']",['10.1007/s10147-008-0774-2 [doi]'],20081023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of a modified acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-90-based protocol in Chinese children and adolescents with LBL. METHODS: From March 1998 to November 2006, 60 untreated patients with LBL (age <18 years) from a single institution were enrolled. All patients were treated with the modified ALL-BFM-90 protocol, and prophylactic cranial radiotherapy was omitted. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 10 years (range, 2.5-18 years). Forty-eight (80%) patients had T-cell LBL, and 59 (98.3%) of the patients were stage III/IV. At the end of induction remission Ia (day 33), 3 patients had died of treatment-related toxicity. In the remaining 57 patients, complete remission (CR) or CR undetermined (CRu) had occurred in 47 (82.45%), who were designated as the moderate-risk group and partial remission (PR) had occurred in 10 patients (17.54%), who were designated the high-risk group. All patients experienced grade 3-4 hematological toxicity. At a median follow-up of 35 months, event-free survival was 78.81%+/-0.05 for all patients; the figure was 88.34%+/-0.05 for the moderate-risk group (90.91%+/-0.08 for stage III, 87.68%+/-0.06 for stage IV, 100% for those with B-cell LBL, 84.78%+/-0.06 for those with T-cell LBL, and 82.94%+/-0.08 for stage IV patients with more than 25% blast cells in bone marrow [BM]). The event-free survival in the high-risk group was 60%+/-0.15. CONCLUSION: This modified ALL-BFM-90 protocol is an effective regimen and it greatly improved the survival rate of Chinese children and adolescents with LBL compared with the ALL protocols used previously.","[""Department of Medical Oncology, Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University, 651 Dongfeng Road, East Guangzhou 510060, People's Republic of China. gzsunxf@yahoo.com.cn""]",['10.1007/s10147-008-0771-5 [doi]'],20081023,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixteen patients were transplanted at Ain Shams University Bone Marrow Transplantation unit from March 2005 to January 2008. RESULTS: Sixteen patients were transplanted with a median age of 25 years. Indications for transplantation were chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, aplastic anemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and aggressive lymphoma. Seven donors and 6 patients were positive for cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody (Ab) pretransplant. Only one patient was positive for toxoplasma IgG Ab and another had a high titre for toxoplasma IgM Ab pretransplant. Two donors and 2 recipients were positive for hepatitis B antibody markers; however, none were positive for hepatitis B virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). None of the patients or donors were positive for hepatitis C virus via PCR pre-transplant. Acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) was seen in 3 patients, while chronic GVHD was seen in 5 patients. Primary cause of death was recurrence in 2 patients and graft failure in one patient. Thirteen are alive and disease free with a median follow-up of 20 months. CONCLUSION: Although our unit is a relatively new unit, these results are comparable to those achieved in the Western world and cost a mean of US$250,000.","['Department of Clinical Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt. mahazimaity@gmail.com']","[""20080511' [pii]""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously developed an antibody-avidin fusion protein that targets hTfR (anti-hTfR IgG3-Av) and exhibits intrinsic cytotoxicity against certain malignant cells. Gambogic acid (GA), a drug that also binds hTfR, induces cytotoxicity in several malignant cell lines. We now report that anti-hTfR IgG3-Av and GA induce cytotoxicity in a new broader panel of hematopoietic malignant cell lines. Our results show that the effect of anti-hTfR IgG3-Av is iron-dependent whereas that of GA is iron-independent in all cells tested. In addition, we observed that GA exerts a TfR-independent cytotoxicity. We also found that GA increases the generation of reactive oxygen species that may play a role in the cytotoxicity induced by this drug. Additive cytotoxicity was observed by simultaneous combination treatment with these drugs and synergy by using anti-hTfR IgG3-Av as a chemosensitizing agent. In addition, we found a concentration of GA that is toxic to malignant hematopoietic cells but not to human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Our results suggest that these two compounds may be effective, alone or in combination, for the treatment of human hematopoietic malignancies.","['Department of Surgery, Division of Surgical Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1782, USA.']","['leu2008270 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2008.270 [doi]']",20081023,"['CA107023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'D43-TW000013-S1/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'CA107023-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA057152-13S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA107023/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50CA096888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA057152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K01 CA086915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'D43 TW000013/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA096888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC3739978,['NIHMS508983'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study subjects were stratified into undernourished (35) and well-nourished (31) based on weight for age. Then, protocol based induction of remission was started. Completion of induction was monitored through physical, haematological and morphological examination of bone marrow aspirate. Infection was ruled out clinically and culture sensitivity. Demographic, anthropometric, haematological, clinical and outcome variables were considered in both groups. At initial presentation, 53.03% were undernourished and 46.97% were well-nourished. Male preponderance was found in both groups. Under-nourished children of ALL had significantly decreased weight (p<0.03) and low haemoglobin concentration (p<0.04) at initial presentation. The undernourished children at initial presentation and during induction had about 2 to 3 times more common of culture and clinically proved infection. Undernourished children of ALL required significantly longer duration of induction (p<0.001) and prolonged period of hospital stay (p<0.001). So, it is concluded that under-nutrition is very usual at initial presentation in childhood ALL, are more prone to suffer from infection and thus prolong the duration of induction, hospital stay, even can lead to death.

Using stromal/hematopoietic cell cocultures, we investigated the effects of stroma-derived signals on apoptosis sensitivity in hematopoietic precursors. The leukemia-derived cell line KG1a is resistant to proapoptotic ligands. However, when cocultured with the human stromal cell line HS5 (derived from normal marrow) and exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), KG1a cells showed caspase-3 activation and induction of apoptosis. Apoptosis was contact dependent. Identical results were obtained in coculture with primary stroma. Gene-expression profiling of KG1a cells identified coculture-induced up-regulation of various genes involved in apoptosis, including PYCARD. Suppression of PYCARD expression in KG1a by miRNA interfered with apoptosis. Knockdown of the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) or TNFR2 in HS5 cells had no effect. However, knockdown of R1 in KG1a cells prevented TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, while apoptosis was still induced by TNF-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. Primary CD34(+) cells from MDS marrow, when cocultured with HS5 and TNF-alpha, also underwent apoptosis. In contrast, no apoptosis was observed in CD34(+) cells from the marrow of healthy donors. These data indicate that stroma may convey not only protective effects on hematopoietic cells, but, dependent upon the milieu, may also facilitate apoptosis.","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']","['S0006-4971(20)37854-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-04-152686 [doi]']",20081022,"['R01 HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL082941/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2628371,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed that, in most transplantation patients, variable proportions of donor-derived alloreactive natural killer (NK) cells displaying anti-leukemia activity were generated and maintained even late after transplantation. This was assessed through analysis of donor KIR genotype, as well as through phenotypic and functional analyses of NK cells, both at the polyclonal and clonal level. Donor-derived KIR2DL1(+) NK cells isolated from the recipient displayed the expected capability of selectively killing C1/C1 target cells, including patient leukemia blasts. Differently, KIR2DL2/3(+) NK cells displayed poor alloreactivity against leukemia cells carrying human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles belonging to C2 group. Unexpectedly, this was due to recognition of C2 by KIR2DL2/3, as revealed by receptor blocking experiments and by binding assays of soluble KIR to HLA-C transfectants. Remarkably, however, C2/C2 leukemia blasts were killed by KIR2DL2/3(+) (or by NKG2A(+)) NK cells that coexpressed KIR2DS1. This could be explained by the ability of KIR2DS1 to directly recognize C2 on leukemia cells. A role of the KIR2DS2 activating receptor in leukemia cell lysis could not be demonstrated. Altogether, these results may have important clinical implications for the selection of optimal donors for haplo-HSCT.","['Immunologia, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy. daniela.pende@istge.it']","['S0006-4971(20)39433-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-06-164103 [doi]']",20081022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overall, 183 patients (24.8%) experienced DS, 93 with a severe form (12.6%) and 90 with a moderate form (12.2%). Severe but not moderate DS was associated with an increase in mortality. A bimodal incidence of DS was observed, with peaks occurring in the first and third weeks after the start of ATRA therapy. A multivariate analysis indicated that a WBC count greater than 5 x 10(9)/L and an abnormal serum creatinine level correlated with an increased risk of developing severe DS. Patients receiving systematic prednisone prophylaxis (LPA99 trial) in contrast to those receiving selective prophylaxis with dexamethasone (LPA96 trial) had a lower incidence of severe DS. Patients developing severe DS showed a reduced 7-year relapse-free survival in the LPA96 trial (60% vs 85%, P = .003), but this difference was not apparent in the LPA99 trial (86% vs 88%).","['Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']","['S0006-4971(20)37806-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2008-07-168617 [doi]']",20081022,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
